1,We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close! What I didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. I can't remember when I got a better night's sleep. The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. We'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we're in town!
0,"I wear a size 32 ddd so I do not.expect much support or easy fit from most bras.  I bought a medium and the band is not snug enough, and the cups are ok, they do not compress too much.  On me, this.bra does not have enough support to wear with just one layer shirt. I have to wear a camisole and layer shirts to be seen outside the house.  While little support, this bra is as comfy as you can get for my size.  I love it, and can wear 24 hours straight, but allows quite a bit of bounce for my size. but I will wear to run errands, chores, playing cards. hanging out at home.  Also a great sleep/lounge bra if you are traveling, staying at someone's house, etc."

0,"The concept of the playpen for the pet is nice, yet the workmanship leave much to be desired! I purchased this for a new puppy and immediately thought it was a unique, easy to manipulate product. This was short lived with each time I removed and replaced a stake in the attaching wall units. I first found my puppy chewing on the top cap that this company merely attaches by hand with no adhesive to ensure safety issues such as this. I wasn't happy to find an item my dog could have choked on in her ""safety"" area; I simply reattached it using crazy glue. The next morning I found an new one on the ground in his dog bed that he had thankfully hadn't found. Needless to say, this ""Exercise Playpen"" is now in the garbage. WARNING -this is not a safe product for any animal!!!"

0,Returned because the size medium was much bigger than others I've ordered.  My dog slipped right out of it.
0,I did receive these as a promotion and I really like these gloves. They protect my hands from heat with a pot I took right off the stove and tried them by holding it in my hand. Didn't feel any heat transfer. The silicon grips are great too as I don't feel that my hands are going to slip. Have used them multiple times and they do not transfer heat. I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus. I would probably like the longer cuff for taking pans out of an oven but it is not like these are short and I don't think I will burn myself but maybe if you are a bit clumsy you might? I would totally recommend them even if I was buying them.

0,"I adopted my mix puppy from a shelter and they determined that she was a hound/bull dog mix. 50 lb as an adult guess for her future weight. Since she grew from 12lb to 30 lbs in 2 months, for curiosity, I decided to have her DNA tested. As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) . After researching those breeds on the interent and learning about training, skill and mannerisms, I can now understand her better. I highly recommend this test."

1,"This is a serious sight, it is very bright and has a nice amount of light. The other two have the same design, but they have different sights, so you should get the right one. It will cost you a bit more for the same sight as the other two, but it is a nice value. I would recommend this sight to anyone who wants to take a different sight set. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very good quality scope for their needs. Very nice, quick delivery, and great price. I recommend this product to everyone. Just what I wanted for my AR-15. Great quality and price. I had some other reviews and this one was my favorite. I can tell you I've had a few of these and they work great."

Chase's daughter has his heart, and then his deceased wife's childhood friend arrives to see the wife, and claims his and baby Ava's heart.  Chase is not sure if he can forget the past and embrace the future.  Violet is a trust fund heiress, who is loving , kind , compassionate, and very generous.  Upon setting her eyes on Chase, she knows Chase and Ava has stolen her heart.  Will Chase forget old hurts and embrace the love he has never had with anyone else?

I was a little disappointed in the ending, as it was a very abrupt ending. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I love this series. It has all the elements I love to read about. I loved the main characters. The story line is great."

I read a lot of it and am glad I did.  I read this as a freebie for a reason. I have read a lot of books by this author, and she knows how to tell a story. I also liked that the book was not a single book. I will be reading the next one, too.  I did not find myself having to re-read the entire book.

1,Best quality swim googles I use for the summer and winter swims. These go well with the swim cap and the swim cap I got.  The swim cap is a great quality and fits nicely.  It is a good size for the size I am and for the size I have.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large head and wants to wear a swim cap.Great product for the price. Easy to use and use.

It was very interesting to see what was happening with the police and what was happening with the people who were helping them.  I was especially interested in the the fact that the cops were the ones who had to deal with the problem.  This book has a lot of action.  I like that the main characters have strong personalities.  I enjoyed the fact that the cops were the ones who dealt with the problem.  I loved the fact that they had a different way of dealing with the problem.  I am hoping that the book will continue to be a series.This is a cute story about a few people who go through a lot of ups and downs.  It was good to see that they had a good relationship, but not one that was easy.  I would recommend this story to anyone who is looking for a cute romance with a sweet,"
0,"My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad, not really knowing it's location. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. (It's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown. ) Great for shopping. The hotel itself was fabulous. The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants. I recommend going to Joe's that's right across the street from the hotel. Everyone was raving about it . . .but we couldn't get a reservation. The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere. My husband loved the workout room. I highly recommend the Conrad!!"
0,"I found this book both very confusing and sort of boring. And not only that, but it seemed to drag on endlessly. It took me until mid-way through the third chapter to even figure out that Juliet was a grieving widow, and why? And when she came home and found a naked man in her pool, she acted like she didn't even know who he was, and yet, he had been around for years while caring for her sick husband. I found that really, really odd. There was a lot of the inner thought process going on in both of their heads all through the book, and they weren't even complete thoughts, at that!  I have read books by this author before and enjoyed her humor and quirkiness, but not this time. I will continue to read her books in the future, though, because she normally does a fantastic job. IMO- I don't know why, but something just felt a bit off with this one."

1,"I have some iron dumbbells that have the iron chain in them.  These have the iron chain in them so they don't get stuck.  The ring is a little too loose and the chain is too loose.  The next time I use them I will see if they would work.  They work great for the purpose.  I can't wait to use them.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time,"

1,"The InterContinental Chicago is located in the heart of Downtown Chicago, Illinois on North Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile. This hotel is located within moments, not minutes, from the Navy Pier, Millennium Park, and Magnificent Mile Shopping. The InterContinental Chicago boasts a modern fitness center that feature free weights, a cardio room, dry saunas, as well as, masseurs. When business knocks at your door, the hotel has a 24 hour business center providing high-speed internet access, fax, and photocopying services. The accommodations at the InterContinental Chicago are elegant with a touch of historic decor. The room had a breath-taking view of Chicago, as well as, had an in-room mini-bar, terry-cloth bath robes, over-sized desks, high-speed internet access, and a 37-inch Hi Def LCD Television. Not only was the overall quality of the property in stunning condition, the staff at the InterContinental Chicago were welcoming, caring, and demonstrated a profound customer-service base."

I am enjoying the look, but also the workings; it swivels with ease to any direction, and the pull down faucet head is amazing. The sprayer function works perfectly, also. It's both beautiful and functional."

0,"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey. I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."
0,"I love this stand. I bought it so that I could set up my iPad to use for my guestbook at my wedding and it worked wonderfully. It was sturdy but still easy to adjust for my non-tech-savvy relatives. The only downside (and this is not related to the product) is that I bought it as an warehouse deal which said ""minor cosmetic damage possible"" but instead it was missing a whole piece. There are supposed to be little foam stickers for the corners that help keep it gripped, but it works fine without them so I just went with it. I'm considering also purchasing the one that mounts on the wall for use in my kitchen."

The only thing I don't like is that Dani is only 14 and way too young to have the smoldering sexual tension that Mac and Barrons had. I hope the next book in the series fast forwards a few years! I don't think I can wait for her to turn a respectable age before she finally loses her V-card to...who will it be? Dancer, Christian or Ryodan? Hmmmm the possibilities! I hope Karen Marie Moning doesn't wait a year to release the next book in the series!"
0,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."
0,"This is a very dense bone that is 5.5 inches long by about 2 inches wide.  My 80 lb greyhound loves it.  It's almost too big for him.  I do think it cleans his teeth because he has to work so hard gnawing at it to get even the tiniest chunk to come off the end.  He only gets through about half of this bone before he's full and tired.  Then I remove it and save it for the next day.  The 4 stars are because it's messy.  It leaves orangish debris on his bed that is sticky and gross, in my opinion, not his :-)  He'd give it a 10."

Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long, however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day! The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel. All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room, good service, and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby, will be heading back to this hotel many times."
0,"Even better because rooted in historical fact and a real lust for science.  But better than some other MC books was the richness and depth of the characters, their experiences and context.  I got lost in this book. An excellent read!  Thanks to the family for bringing this terrific story to life."
0,"I have traveled to Chicago many times for business, and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons. There was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton, but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel. It almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs. The carpets were old, there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, towels and linens were older than I expected, the rooms were in need of some redecorating, etc. during the week I was paying $349 per night for a room, and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price. One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good. Plenty of aerobic machines with TVs, weights, etc. location is also quite good (perhaps the reason for the high price) with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river. In summary, I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago."

First of all, the 'central' location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier (which this hotel claims to be the 'official' hotel of) and to the shops on the Mile. Secondly, the hotel is small - only 215 rooms, most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. Thirdly, they have one restaurant and one lounge, both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia!"

I phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first. Horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. Bathroom was incredibly small. Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. Very cramped. The beds weren't very comfortable either. Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy. Location seem very convenient. I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. But all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. And don't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card. It was about $2/minute. I knew it would be expensive but wasn't expecting that type of rate."

0,"The second book in the Asylums for Magical Threats series is mesmerizing paranormal romance that takes the reader on an adventure.  Fighting to free elemental magic users, Camilla Melini is on a mission to find one of the legendary Four Talents. Marco Alvarez is sent to Mexico with two goals  to watch Cams back and to investigate a series of arson fires. Despite their differences they will have to work together to save their colleagues and to keep the Talent from falling into the wrong hands.  This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.  The author uses well written scenes and events to inspire vivid images that capture the imagination.  Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.  The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes. The bad guys in this series really inspire outrage and anger, only thing is there are so many plots and conflicts going on, the reader not really sure which ones are the bad guys, which of course keeps things real interesting.  The author has created a fascinating world of elemental magic that has surprising twists and turns, intriguing subplots and captivating characters with dazzling abilities that ensure that the reader never gets bored and I was engrossed in this thrilling story from beginning to end and I cant wait to find out what happens next."

Since the watch did not come with documentation and instructions, it took forever to set the day, date function, and time!  This means the watch does not have a SEIKO warranty! The band fits, but is very thin cheap like ans no solid feel! The chrome finish look, diminishes the quality look of good stainless steel! In trying to read the Serial Number and other details on back of watch, make sure to have a jeweler do it, as a 6x magnifying glass is difficult at best to  get the Seiko case numbers. I intend to call SEIKO with serial number at determine when the watch was made, as even solar batteries have limited life! Essentially I am very unhappy with this watch. I called Seiko C/S. They have no estimate of solar cell-battery. Cost to replace with shipping etc about $90. BEWARE of SOLAR watches!

0,"I purchase this book to flesh out data regarding life in post war Europe.  Having interviewed survivors of the conflict in both eastern and western Europe I was disappointed at the lack of substance and the lack of clarity of the author.  It started with the author's allegation that there is a vast amount of information about Eastern Europe and his intention to portray a balanced look at Europe as a whole.  Surprisingly, the focus continued to be Western Europe with some information regarding Eastern Europe.  For, example is that a crucial piece of data omitted as to the penalty for harboring a Jew in occupied Europe:  Specifically, that only in Poland was a death penalty imposed.  Then, the misrepresentation of facts and eyewitness accounts to fit the author's notions.  For example, Lowe reported soviet atrocities seemingly as portrayed by Nazi propaganda (""...according to the German Captain..."") whilst minimizing Soviet eyewitnesses German atrocities (""...claimed a Read Army soldier..."").  I can go on ad infinitum but will relay an omission of fact.  Upon annexing western Poland into the Reich, the Germans proceeded to deport Polish inhabitants to the General Government area with the vacant house occupied by colonizers.  What could have been an excellent book on the subject of post war struggles to survive turned out to be a book with slanted conclusions as well as selective presentation of facts.  One thing that the author did capture correctly albeit again slanted was the actions of the western soldiers.  We hear of the raping of French colonial troops.  We hear how the Americans paid desperate women for sex (which is a form of rape).  However, we hear that the British soldier were disgusted.  Can it be that Lowe is a British author?  A vast majority of soldiers behave badly in war.  The rarity is the noble soldier who does nothing bad or evil."

1,I have wanted one of these for awhile now and decided to purchase this one for the first time. It's not the best but it's good enough to be worth the money.I have used this bulb in the past and I am very pleased. I have used it in the past with no problems. I have also used it with a 60 watt incandescent bulb and it has been very effective.
0,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.  However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."

0,"This is a tough one to review... as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average.... 2 is where it was. Here are my tips and props/complaints: Room: 1 Star. I had a corner suite. The room was pretty nasty actually (2703..STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!). There was a CONSTANT banging noise from above. When I first got in I thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding. After an hour, I knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong. Well, the sound continued on for 3 days. Not that I minded too much as I keep things on for white noise... but it sure would bug others. Also, there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa. In addition, it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa. Also, there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat. I could not imagine all the DNA left on that thing either. *gags* Bathroom: Nice size but not great. The faucet was lose (really lose) and the toilet would not flush right. Service: Great. Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome. Good stuff. Food: I had meetings there, so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made. It was really good... much better than most hotels. Bar: Very cool. Good music, great service and good drinks. The scene was decent as well. Small bar, but was not cramped. So, maybe other rooms are nicer... well hell they better be. Regardless, if ONE room is like that (especially a 'suite'), I have to think others are like that as well. It is too bad though. The views are great and they actually have windows that open... big shocker for the city in general!"

The book also includes the words ""War is the most effective means of achieving peace"" in the title of the book.

It is a great resource for anyone interested in peace and on peace talks. It is very easy to understand and to apply to any situation. The book is highly recommended for any political or economic situation.  I am a big fan of the book and it has been recommended by some friends."
1,"What a gorgeous hotel! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago. The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better, and to top it off with great restaurants, you couldn't ask a hotel for more! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we'll be back every time we visit Chicago."
0,"Beautiful looking faucet with great features and works perfectly. Installation was a snap, really easy because it was well designed to ease installation. The pullout sprayer works great and I really like having a switch for stream or spray that remains set whether the water is on or not. Some faucets require water flowing to change from stream to spray. The magnetic spray head works really well to hold the spray head in place and not sagging. Overall I cannot find anything that I don't like about this faucet and soap dispenser."

0,"Used this to splice join together two audio cables and started to wonder why my music sounded so strange.  A little bit of testing showed that this coupler was outputting a mono signal instead of a stereo signal.  Both speakers were getting sound but it was from the same channel, the other channel was being left behind.  I had to go out to an electronics store to get one that worked correctly."

0,"I tried these earhones and I waited and waited and finally when they came I was so happy. Well when I was trying to pull them out of their tight packaging one of them slightly snapped. They  still sounded the same, but they didn't look it. The bass is probably the only thing that is really good about these like I said before. The mids are somewhat there and the highs are almost no where to be found. The sound isolation was okay, blocking some noise while music was playing but my previous Etymotic Er6i isolators did a much better job for 40$ more. I did insert them all the way into my ears, for what seemed to be as far as they could go. All in all, if all you need is bass consider these, if not just look elsewhere.  Oh yeah, I have a newer ipod, so sound coming from it is bound to be good. So there should be no problems coming from the music side."

You can stuff them with a never-ending variety of treats, so your dog won't ever get bored. They're easily washed as well - either with your fingers, or in the dish washer. When my dogs see these, they go crazy! One of the best ""bang for your buck"" options out there."

1,My 76lb pup loves this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. There's a hole in the bottom that is the plastic part. The toy is made of plastic and it's hard to put together. There are two pieces of plastic in the center that are a bit difficult to put together. I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing issue or just a design issue.
0,"I've worn these to my job at the sawmill (were I work outside in the cold) and so far I love them! They are not good for hiking around which I did in them the first day, but with some insoles in them, they have been very comfortable and warm! A little bigger than I expected but sometimes I wear two pair of socks so I think think I'll keep the size I have. Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them. I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!  I lowered to a 3 from a 5.  The first pair were great but the second pair I bought took months to break in and caused so many blisters.  The waterproofing failed in one shoe fairly quickly so rainy days at work suck."

Close the Velcro flap. Assembly complete.  Now it's ready to go - from unpacking to the kid riding around the house, under five minutes. Because of the wheel design, it can spin, and move on smooth floor or carpet. There's also a bumper on the front of the pillow racer to prevent running into walls or tipping forward.  All in all a cool little toy!"
0,"As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro, I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left. She seems to have a cough today. In the room on my right, someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit. I hear the water running and the toilet flushing. I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs. Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms. I've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst. The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains, the curtains with a large brown stain (I don't want to guess what it is), paint peeling, rips in the wallpaper. The decor is a bit garish, with Pepto-Bismol covered walls, green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet. The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable, but I'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others' toilets flushing all night. The location is good for downtown theaters or business. Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly. Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I've enjoyed quite a bit. Unfortunately this is not one of them, and even more unfortunate for me: I'm stuck here for two more nights. I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip, comfortable and attractive. This is not."

I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. I was looking forward to reading the book, but the last part was so repetitive that I didn't get into it. I'm glad it was longer, because it was well written and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book. This story was well written and the characters were believable. It's definitely a book you want to read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing."

This movie is very kid friendly but adults can enjoy it too.  We were smiling and laughing from beginning to end.  I think that this movie was better than the first and would recommend to anyone who has younger children but enjoys watching animation movies themselves.  Would be a great movie for a family night!  Enjoy."

These characters are so well written you start falling in love with them immediately.  This story is sensuous, sexy and erotic. Savannah grew up under the rule of an emotionless, iron fisted father. No wonder the woman is still a virgin at 30 something.  Matt is dominant without being domineering.  He's shown her in a hundred different ways how he loves her. How did she miss the signs?  Looking forward to read each of the Wunderkind stories. Such unique personalities that we've only been given a glimpse of."
0,We have a mini schnauzer and this works well on him. He barks and raises hell with everyone & thing in the alley. We have a privacy fence but he still challenges every body and ignores spoken commands. With the Pet Agree I can be on my deck some 40 plus feet away from the dog barking thru the fence and and give the unit just a quick tap and instantly redirect the dog's attention and stop his barking. I find he is barking at things real or imagined much less than before we got the Pet Agree. And if needed a quick tap always does the trick.

1,"I was pleased to see that it was free of allergens.  My dog loves this stuff.I bought this for a friend's cat and she is a huge fan of it. It is a little hard to get on her, but it's not really heavy so it's not a problem. It's a bit heavy for her, but she's not a big chewer. I wish I would have gotten it a little bigger for her, because it's hard to get her to stop when I get it. I would have given it a 5 for her, but I didn't. She's a big chewer, so I wanted to give it a 5 because she's a little too big for it to stay on. I'm not sure if it's a problem with her weight, but it's not the only thing she enjoys. I haven't noticed any changes in her coat, but I have noticed a slight improvement in her eating habits.My cats love this food. My dog is about 20 lbs. and he was very picky about his food. I would recommend this food to anyone with a picky dog. I give it to my cat twice a day for her daily dose of treats.I was worried about the quality of this bed but it is great! I have a two year old cat who had an eye infection and needed help with her eating. I was able to get her a quality bed and she is happy with it!

Our past characters play some major roles, along with the intro to a few new ones. When I start a book in this series, I have a very hard time putting it down. Jack the Ripper was a nice twist. While a lot of backstory is given, I would definitely say this series is better enjoyed being read in order. Arial is an amazing author that pulls you into the story with the first sentence.

I mean, twenty bucks!? the mind boggles, anyways in our case it was a gift, so here we go: It's really cute. Each little bug has this super happy smile on its face, they're all really soft and each one has some nice feature, like wings that crinkle or a rattle inside. My son (6 mos) likes the spider best because he can get a really good grip on the legs and then try to cram the entire thing into his mouth (not possible).

At first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. To make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. This was simply unacceptable by any standard."

Sometimes this means flying even though it's not my favorite way to travel and sometimes I still need a tent when I get where I'm going. I'm not mad of crazy cash and also really believe that caring for the things I own and continuing to use the same possessions is the best form of conservation so getting this footprint was a no brainer to protect my new Kelty Grand Mesa 2. I've had a chance to pack out with it twice and it's way smaller than having to bring a tarp. It easily fits in the Grand Mesa's bag along with the tent, does a great job protecting the bottom of the tent from wear and the two nights we had substantial rain even though I was camped on a slope my tent stayed very dry. I get that it's a little more expensive and less versatile then a tarp but for me it's exactly what I need in a super light weight easy to pack product and I'm very happy with it."

0,"I got this originally because I was into the Lorelei's Grasp based on reviews I read. I'd never seen a Naschy go this way or that way, and ended up watching Horror rises from the Tomb first and really dug it. If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror films from the 70s based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film looks great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fans - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scenes where he gets to paw his actresses' naked breasts every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you?  Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babes at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girls like idiots and send them back to their rooms, then shake their heads in disbelief when they're murdered two minutes later... ""we did all we could"". Some people like movies where cops are staking out a school being attacked nightly by a monster, and then one of the girls complains there's breathing in her room and the cops just think she's imagining it and then act surprised an hour later when she's dead -- oh those hysterical women! At least that's how I remember it. You get the idea though. Eventually there's a twisted dark reflection of THE LITTLE MERMAID's trans-species / terrain love affair and a cool underwater cavern lair."

0,"Snapbridge is a joke bordering on fraud.  I ordered the camera and waited 8 months for delivery in order to take wildlife photos. The remote control was vital to my work.  Spent and entire day trying to get remote control to work.  I was using an I-phone 6s and all the latest software and it wanted a wifi connection as well as bluetooth.  Either one did not work.  I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.  If i made claims in my business like Nikon made in selling me this camera I would be in jail for fraud."

0,"I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online. Unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. When we arrived, we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold. So, we had to move to another hotel. Amalfi did take care of the other hotel, cab fare, and after much negotiating...breakfast. We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient. Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned, we had to get up, pack up our suitcases, check out of the hotel, take a cab, check back into the Amalfi, only then could we head to the museum. We were also told that our first night's stay would be refunded. Well, more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later...there still hasn't been a refund. I can't even get a manager to call me back. The Amalfi wasn't all bad, it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance. The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. However, it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended. One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles, but they seemed really small for queens. Our view from our room was of the alley. So, overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor. Very disappointing indeed!"

0,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:  1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents. 2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend. 3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container. 4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking. 5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor. 6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems. 7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes. 8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.  I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

0,"A great read! Fun! Reading it feels like watching one of the best of the Clone Wars episodes. The writing is excellent and the characters are well-drawn. It not only shows how great characters change -- Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos -- but also how the entire Jedi Council is evolving downward. The beginning chapters show how far the Jedi Council has moved from a worldview of pure good vs. pure evil to one where questionable tactics are both considered and chosen. Obi Wan makes a great supporting character here. Anakin Skywalker is even more in the background, but considering his own romance (i.e. in Jedi terms, emotional attachment) with Padme, I'm sure he was taking notes from the relationship of Quinlan Vos/Asajj Ventress."

Ethan has a great imagination and is ready to take his chances in life. Ethan is a sweetheart who has always had a crush on a woman he's never met. Ethan is a good boy who doesn't like girls.

0,"I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).  I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.  With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.  Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.  We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.  Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.  Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money."
0,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress. I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes. The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.  I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate. This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.  For reference, I am 5'3, 140lbs, 36D-29-39.  Hope this helps someone."

0,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.  1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.  2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.  3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).  4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.  These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."

0,This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.
0,"I stayed for just one nite at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA posters but I was not let down. I got the room via PL @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. Since I had nothing to lose, I asked to be moved to a 'room with a view'. The front desk attendant( Rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was. She then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat PL and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier, a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of Lake Michigan. All this for $70? Yep! I skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! The room was comfy, had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. I didnt use it since I wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. The bed and pillows were very comfy, but I awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but VERY WARM and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again."

0,"I am crushed because I LOVED this book, and looked forward to the movie since I read it when it came out!  I am crushed because despite the anger I have I liked the move but I am crushed because I also hated it!  The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!  The movie makes no sense, even my wife who had not read the books said it feels incomplete and half-made...  I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...  The director destroyed the heart and soul of this book by taking the MAIN story line out, and lightening it up! I am surprised J.K. Rowling did not step in and say NO you ruined my book!  I am severly upset about this!  They need to be forced to fix this!"
0,It is often hard to find over sized beach towels. As soon as I came across this one I knew I had to have it. I love the flower design and it has the most vibrant colors. I would definitely recommend this towel to anyone that is a serious beach/pool person. You won't be disappointed.
0,"Issues and/or things to note: 1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL 2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose. 3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.) 4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.  Improvements from older Iron Man figures: 1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit. 2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45. 3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.  Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details. This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far."

0,"Cary Grant was gorgeous, suave, a very good actor, and at times could be a controlling and confused man. Dyan Cannon writes about Mr. Grant with openness, and yes, is is HER autobiography as well as his biography in a sense. Covering the years from her start in Hollywood to just about the current day, Ms. Cannon does not hold back in her analysis of what made Mr. Grant tick. Having read several books by other authors, and having a film history background, there was little in the book that made me doubt Ms. Cannon's veracity. Cary Grant was open about his LSD experimentation and was constantly searching for depth and meaning in his personal life and retired at probably just the perfect moment; before his looks were regarded as passes to 1960s filmgoers and just as he himself was growing bored with his work.  The latter part of the book focuses on the repercussions of her marriage and life with Cary Grant and much was new and enlightening. (I do not spoil plots or details). A loving mother, continuing to act and work in films, Dyan Cannon has written a very good addition to the Hollywood biography canon."

Anyways I've bought him the other nylabones that aren't as durable and he chews pieces off the bone in 5 minutes. Then he would eat it. I would have to take it away from him and he'd try to find ways to get the bone. Well this big bone is great!

Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""  The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.  However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."

She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of force required exceeds what she can apply sometimes. I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck. Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm. Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer.

0,"This Novella was pretty fantastic.  The Submission of Alistair Ingram really hit it out of the park for me.  This is the Story of Black Betty(Bethany) a Dom at Dolls and Doms private mens club in Vegas and Alistair Ingram movie star.  Allistair meets Black Betty at his Bachelor Party at the exclusive club.  He leaves with a torn shirt and red marks on his chest.  Courtesy of Black Betty of course.  His Fiance Heather is not too happy about this turn of events.  Engagement broken and Black Betty thrown into the headlines as the other woman.  The only thing wrong with that is Black Betty has been hiding from her ex.  Now she needs to get away before she is found.    Now it seems to me that Black Betty(Bethany) has somewhat of a twisted past and she has been living as Black Betty to escape that.  Never confronting her fears or trusting anyone but herself.  Alistair on the other hand is a famous movie star and hasn't been able to dominate anything in his life as of lately.  So we find these two are more in like with each other than they want to be.  This truly is a story of facing your fears and moving on.  Learning to trust the one your with.  I loved Alistair more and more as the book went on.  Especially when he used his British accent.  How I love a British accent!  Black Betty too.  She was honest, brave, and loyal to a tee.    I am looking forward to see where these two are headed.  Big decisions in their future!  But here and now I hope they are enjoying their ride.  They both deserve to be happy."

The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...  First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.  Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.  Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...  Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.  *dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat.

0,"This season is hard to stomach.  The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.  You probably want to skip this one."

Then after looking at reviews bought Coleman and Igloo to compare and a generic converter (Shumacher 6v) since it looked like they didn't come with any. (Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons: 1. Cord came off the unit completely as shown in photo 2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf 3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best 4. Shelf  Loaded cooler the day before travel to save time morning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: Forgot the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.  Awesome item. Saves time, money, food, and don't know why I never got one before! Simple.  No loading ice every day and repacking the cooler."

0,"Ordered these from Amazon but there was problem with 1-day shipping. Ended up getting them from Peter Glenn, as I needed them in time for a trip. But after experiencing them, I just had to come leave a review. I mostly wear Merino Wool dress socks, as my wardrobe is primarily comprised of suits. However, when I do wear sneakers, I solely wear Viscose socks made from Bamboo, which has a softness similar to or surpassing cashmere socks (depending on the brand), and have become quite spoiled by them. I was looking for a nice pair of Bamboo no-show socks, and I encountered this brand on Amazon. Eye-brow raised, because it had the best of both worlds in the composition (Merino Wool + Bamboo). So I ordered the Ultra-light version, and was surprisingly disappointed because that version was abrasive / scratchy; not soft at all. But there were so many great reviews on these socks, and I noticed there was a thicker version (Ultra-Light versus Light Cushion), so I decided to experiment and give them a try as I thought the thicker version might be softer. Well, I'm glad that I did, because these socks feel great. The feel is very comparable to Cariloha bamboo socks, which is the best pure bamboo viscose brand I've encountered and I've tried tonnes of brands. I'm glad that I tried this brand as Cariloha socks although there is a low cut version, they are not compression socks. Feetures! has the cashmere range level of softness, with the compressive benefits making it the all around best sports sock I've tried. I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that, first the socks are not truly ""no-show"" socks. It's very easy to see the socks, but I like that it doesn't cover my ankles. The other thing is the branding. I would've prefered more subtle branding, perhaps only a symbol / logo, but that's a personal style thing. It does not inhibit nor take away from the experience of the sock."
1,"If your desire is to use an electric drill, you may need to make a small hole in the bottom of the drill to get a solid surface to hold the drill in place.

If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy). If you have a toddler that is more interested in tinkering rather than necessarily playing (like my little guy), check out Speedy, NOT this workbench!"

1,"I like these pants a lot. The quality is good.  The only reason I ordered a size 6.5 is because I thought they would be too tight. They were fine but it was too tight. I would have liked to have ordered a size 7.5 but I would have given them a 6.5 because I'm a big girl and these fit so well. They are cute though. I'm not sure if they will stretch as I wear them out of the house though. I would probably order the smaller size, but I'm not sure how long it will hold up.  If you have a wide butt, it is not as big as I thought it would be. I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and the shirt I ordered had a nice, long sleeves. I have a very small chest, so I would have ordered a medium. It was too big for me. I would have gotten a medium. I think I might order a half size up.  I'm happy with the product. I'll update this review if I notice a difference.Great, very comfortable, and I ordered the white one and I loved it.  I have a ton of compliments on it.  It is very comfortable and fits great.  I am 5'2"" and 125lbs and it's perfect for me.I love it. Great material. Good quality.  Will definitely be buying more of this product in the future.I have purchased these shoes for my husband for our wedding"
0,"My Boston Terrier has MegaEsophogus which causes regurgitation of food eaten hours earlier.  It's a must that I have a harness that falls below the throat while walking him as this exacerbates his condition.  With this ""Step-in"" harness, it sits low on his chest yet does a good job of holding him back.  Putting the harness on can be a bit of a challenge but I've figured that out rather quickly.  There is a bit of stretch after a month or 2 of use but not enough to make the harness useless.  And you can tighten it if you need to. All in all I am very pleased."
0,Great product. I bought these to replace another head set that I bought that did not work very well. I have the LG HBS 900 but the right side speaker has a loose wire and i had to wiggle it to work. These are an older model compared to the LG HBS 900 but they are just as clear and what I like the most is that the portion that goes around the neck is flexible. The LG HBS 900 is a hard plastic and is not flexible.

1,"I am very happy with this product and the quality. I will keep my review in order to share my experiences. The only thing I can say is that if you are looking for a quality speaker, look no further. I am very pleased with the sound quality and the build quality. I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony A-100 on Amazon for $250. 00. It works perfectly and seems to last for quite a while. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade their old Sony A-100 to a better product. I have a Sony A-100 in my home that does not have a built in speaker that I use for sound. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a better product. I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery. I have a 10 year old Sony A-100 and have had no problems with the batteries. I have used this product for a few months and am very happy with the results. The rechargeable battery is easy to use, it has a built in charger, and it has a strong sound."
1,"My experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible. I went to Chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. This hotel was recommended by the wedding party. It was a terrible choice. Despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. Overall, I would say I was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. On the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. Still, I would not return here again."

0,"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).  It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.  Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying."
0,"This is a very nice series.  The show gets a lot of flack for down time, but hey, most anime out there has it.  There's plenty of action, the acting is good (especially Vegeta!), and it is just a fun overall series.

I'm very pleased with the quality of the product.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the extension cord to carry my flashlight.  I can carry it anywhere, even if I don't have an extension cord.  The cord is very easy to use.  The included black and white micro USB port is great for connecting a spare battery, and the included USB charging port is perfect for charging a battery pack.  I'll be ordering more of these to replace my old extension cord.  I'll keep an eye on the quality of the product.This is a very cool feature.  I use it in conjunction with my wife's flashlight.  I have the two of them.  I use them in a shop and they look very nice.  I have two of them in the garage.  The light is very bright.

0,"Literature Lighthouse  Review for/Author: Eva Gordon Book title: Alpha Wolfs Pet 2, Kept Page length: 171 Price at time: $2.99 Review:  I was first introduced to Eva Gordons work through her first book in this series, Alpha Wolfs Pet book 1, hidden. I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)  Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?   Review by: Kristy Dean  11/2014"

It's a little thin, but it's not heavy.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that it's not a micro-USB port, which is a nice feature.  Other than that, it's a nice little drive.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this drive.  It's a solid drive, and it's solid.

I believe it was removed. Also the nasal voice informing you that the speaker is on, what mode it's on and that bluetooth is paired is  bit annoying. Turning the volume all the way up will make a loud beeping sound letting you know you on max volume. The sound is really good though. Very loud and crisp."

0,"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid. Newsflash! Neither are today's kids.  I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.  I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.  However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.  I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.  I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.  Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!  It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children. Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.  It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.  Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.  There is lots to do with it! We like it very much. I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring. I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading! Mom of five sons here! :) jean"

0,"Thunderbolt transfers are ridiculously fast compared to Firewire and USB -- 10 gbps -- and are incredibly handy when working on the fly with large files. It's an excellent choice for large video, photo, and audio files. It can be daisychained, too, so you can have multiple adapters setup for one machine (ultimate efficiency and speed!).  Unfortunately, no cable is included - so this can become an expensive upgrade pretty quickly.  I used this in conjunction with a 3TB Seagate drive, and was very pleased at its utility for backing up and storing files; Thunderbolt's speed is definitely overkill for regular small backups, but is invaluable with huge files and directories. It doesn't require a Seagate hard drive, just any SATA III drive."

Theoretically, any Miracast capable device, i.e. an Intel processor with video of recent vintage (<2 years) should work with it, but I have yet to test this.  Basically, your device creates a direct WiFi connection over 2.4ghz to the device itself.. thus the connectivity is a dedicated network using a streamlined protocol..the result is, or Screen Sharing, it runs circles around Chromecast, DLNA and even AppleTV which all attach to the network and packets/data are pushed over tcp/ip."

0,"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros: -On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons: -If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it."

I also needed a strong shoe that is fit to ride in, so when chores are done, I can just jump on one of my horses without going into the house to change.  In addition, I'm taking a sightseeing trip this summer and will be on my feet at least 12 hours a day.  These boots completely fit the bill.  They are attractive enough that they look great with jeans or khakis.  They look especially cute with white socks and walking shorts.  They are not too clunky, they look like brown sneakers/shoes.  They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period was required.  I stomped through the mud and water and my socks stayed nice and dry.  I worked outside for a good 12 hours, the first time I put them on, and when I got in the house, I felt good, my back, knees and feet felt just fine, all of which I have trouble with.  They are true to size.  I will replace them with another pair when they wear out.  Money well spent.  I recommend them highly.

0,"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!  The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.  The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.  Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them."

I found the way the author describes the different stages of marriage very helpful. The advice on how to stay in love also hit home for me. Ideally you should read this book before you get married. However, if you are newly married or married for over a decade the advice in this book has extreme value. I only wish I had found it sooner."

She also has a very high opinion of the police as they are on a high level.  The story is pretty straight forward, but the acting is quite good. There is also a little bit of nudity in this film, but it is definitely not sexual. The storyline is not as dramatic as the previous films, but"

0,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.  Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:  - The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.  - The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.  - The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.  - The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.  - Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."

For clean up, immediately after he's done playing with it, I run it under water.  When we ran out of paper, we just got some of the larger sized index cards and cut them to size.  Off the top of my head I can't remember if they're 5x5 or 4x4 squares.  Worked well.  We ran out of paint.  The bottles can be refilled.

1,"I made my reservation at the Hilton Chicago believing I was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. Unfortunately, my stay at the Hilton Chicago went downhill from the moment I checked in. There was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. Once I finally got checked in and located my room, I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. Finally I made it into my room. It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. The manager moved me into a new room, so I can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. Finally settled, I was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. That is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call I had not requested! Needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and I will choose other accommodations for my next trip to Chicago."

0,"In comedy, TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  Subject knowledge comes in a close second. George Burns' decades of entertainment experience allowed him to master both both aspects of comedy.  Whether working alone or with a partner (Gracie Allen, Walter Matthau, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Fred Astaire, Brooke Shields, etc...) George often slipped bits of wisdom in with his punch lines.  Sometimes those were the punch lines.  I could say he was at his best with this collection of TV Specials, but the truth is he was at his best each decade since he partnered with Gracie in 1923.  We can only be thankful George continued working after Gracie's passing in 1964.  The show did go on, and these shows can be enjoyed many, many times - good jokes, no matter how old, never get stale."

0,"This is a great courtroom drama, with detailed analysis of the characters involved. No character is a stereotype, with some approaching pure evil and others somewhat good, but all the characters are believable and their behavior consistent. Turk is very adept at providing just the right level of detail to convey his message. The story and its ending are groaningly realistic. The good guys don't always win, and evil sometimes prevails. Perverted and unusual sex are on display, but not graphic. The message is delivered in good taste, but still delivered. The courtroom action itself is spell-binding, and makes it impossible to break from reading. Give this book a read, you won't be disappointed."
1,"We did a ton of research on the pros and cons of this product before buying this one. The pros are that the dishwasher is easy to clean, and the cons are that it's difficult to clean when it's full.  The cons are that it doesn't stay in place with no maintenance.  I've washed it with soap and water and it's still soapy.  I just put it in the dishwasher and it still looks great.  I would recommend this product for anyone"
1,"This product gets the job done. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life. The battery life is about 8 hours, and it will charge the phone right up to the day of the trip. It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it for about an hour."

0,"Obsession by Jessica Hawkins Beau did not see the revenge coming but when it happened he was angry and wanted to find Lola.  He wanted to destroy her?  Lola played the final card which not only hurt Beau but herself as well.  While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending.. Hot Books & Sassy Girls Blog"

I have noticed that my cat does not cover his feces with the pellets very well though, and I must clean up immediately after he goes. I am not sure if this is due to the product or not, because he covered them better with pine shavings and gravel used before. Perhaps he doesn't like the feel of the pellets in his toes? I feel this product is a good buy for the price, and if you are looking for a more environmentally friendly option it is good. I would not use this with many cats, unless they each have their own box."

0,"It is difficult to find bulbs that look like the ones shown in the picture.  I have gotten gold bulbs that are called amber, even with GE numbers that formerly corresponded to imprints on bulbs that look like the dark amber ones.  I have also searched imprinted dark anber bulb GE parts numbers and found a florescent bulb.  These bulbs are very price, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.  One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.  At least this seller could guarantee they were dark amber."
1,"The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. However, modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. Room service is available 24 hours a day, but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. Two bars are located on the premises, which is appealing at first. Once inside, patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy, of any kind. The guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean, but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. Obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. If you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience, with reliable customer service, booking a room here is probably not a viable option."
0,"Heath is a gorgeous supermodel and user of women. Sadie has agreed to be his live-in chef and assistant, but she is determined not to get involved with him other than professionally. He's exactly the type she always goes for and knows she shouldn't. Sadie gets confusing sometimes. She can't make up her mind, she runs hot and cold. It is entertaining, though. And really, I can see why she's torn. He's used to women falling at his feet and she's a challenge. I really did not want to like Heath at the beginning of the book. I didn't think it was possible. He grew on me, though. By the end of the book I was rooting for him. This ended up being a fun read, with a few tears thrown in. If you like reformed bad boys, I think you'll like this one. *I received a copy for my honest review."

0,"I bought these on my quest to replace all my bulbs with LED. These went in a chandelier that takes 4 bulbs and left me 1 spare. The bulbs are very very white without the fixture covers of the chandelier. My chandelier has an offwhite/yellowish cover over each that is open ended. That makes the light look warm. Without that, these are cool white (I ordered the 6000K bulbs because of the covers). I had 4 of the 25 watt halogens in my chandelier drawing 100 watts total. With these bulbs, I am drawing only 3 watts each at 12 watts total. It is just as bright. The bulbs should last a lot longer and didn't cost any more than the halogens I bought at Wal-Mart. I would suggest getting warm white if not going into a fixture that warms the light...that is unless you like super white light."

0,"The aquasafe water conditioner is a fantastic de-chlorinator. I have used this consistently since cycling my small sized fresh-water tank. The aquasafe works instantly upon mixing with tap water. The water we get here in SoCal is hard with chlorine in it. I have taken the water a few times to the pet store to get it tested and use the Tetra strips at home to test it every few weeks and it does a great jobs at keeping the chlorine to near zero levels. Makes water changes a breeze, and more importantly they ensure the fish (I have cory cats which are sensitive to water/oxygen levels) and neon tetras (not a hardy fresh-water fish) which have been thriving with this water conditioner. 5 stars! It may also be doing a good job at keeping pH levels in check as tests show a near neutral pH as well."

It looks exactly like the Kindle screen- no glare. It is a little bit smaller than the screen which is a good thing since it simplifies application. It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with. There are two in the pack which is probably a good idea for first timers with screen protectors, but it would have been nice to be able to purchase a single for those of us with experience and established technique."

0,"This is not a film for everyone. It sets up a challenging mix of expectations and continually crosses from one genre's conventions to another. It is definitely for film lovers who like something far out of the ordinary. Set in war-time Japan, this story of a doctor literally on the run in his efforts to unravel the mystery of an epidemic of hepatitis among his patients, could be taking place anywhere in this war-torn world today. Resources are in short supply, and everywhere there is violence and fear triggered by the embrace of militarism. The doctor, a heroic figure, is surrounded in this film by the outcasts of society - a prostitute, an opium addict, an escaped prisoner of war. Cheered by recognition from his colleagues in the medical profession that his work is valued and important, he is left with little to make a difference in the world, except his determination to do the best he can.  The sudden shifts of mood in the film, the use of a noisy jazz score, the outbursts of violence, scenes of sexual tension, the heartfelt moments as characters reach out with tenderness to each other, all provide a jumble of conflicting impressions that reflect the chaotic world it mirrors. There's not a single point of view in the film though it ends emphatically with the detonation of an atomic bomb on the horizon, as the doctor and his assistant float in an open boat in the sea (an image that brings to mind the end of Ingmar Bergman's ""Shame""). The film cries out to be viewed again for there is much too much to absorb in a single viewing."

0,"This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure. The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners. The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian. While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, the Ritz and Park Hyatt, it falls short. We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection. While the prices were similar to the Peninsula, we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try. Wow, were we ever disappointed. First off, we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7. OK, thats fine and we sat down. The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong, so that she could make it right. When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ($20 per glass), she consulted with the manager and then another manager (a heavier fellow in a dark suit). She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses. What bothers me is not the outcome, but the fact that the management is not service focused. At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula, this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure, it would be made right. At the Conrad, the Terrace manager just ignored it."

1,"Initial inspection out of the box. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the driver with a different one, so it is not that big of a deal. If you are thinking about buying one of these you should definitely buy the Makita DeWalt 11-Inch 24-Inch 24-Inch Makita DeWalt, with the 9-Inch Makita DeWalt, and the 12-Inch Makita DeWalt, because the DeWalt is the best. I'm glad I did. I like the design of this blade. I have to get the blade to come out of the box, but I don't want to be stuck with a box full of knives. This blade is the best I have used. I would recommend this blade to anyone. I really like these. They are very bright. I use them to light up a room and they are very good. I have been using them for several months now and I am very happy with them. I have used the adjustable dimmer switches in the kitchen to dim the lights in the kitchen. I have had this for about a year now and am very happy with it. The dimmer switch is very dim and I have not had any problems with it.

0,"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received. First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus. Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range. Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect. Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars."

He is very happy with it. He also likes to put it on his bed and it is very sturdy and well made. He has already started to use it. He has not used it for any reason yet but will play with it for a few days. He is very happy with it. I would highly recommend it.This is a fun and challenging game that takes a good mix of strategy, strategy, and strategy.

0,"This is a rather surprising purchase in several ways.  This sandal is soft gold colored,  lightweight, soft plastic but substantial enough with an innersole. The thong strap is comfortable for all day use. The foldable aspect is no problem. You are not aware of the foldable feature when wearing them. It comes with 2 very substantial bands to hold each sandal in a folded position or as a pair with one band. I rather like the bright color bands! The flip-flops have their own durable just the right size zip carryall bag in black with a nice embroider front. Each sandal can be fold in half and banded or unfold and banded as a pair in the bag.  The sandal was not too snug or tight to the foot. I wanted room especially for hot weather comfort but not overly wide either."
1,It hurts me to give this a 3 star because it is a nice piece of equipment but it is a very small piece of equipment. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because it is so small. I would have liked it a little bit longer. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style for him to use. I am very pleased with this product. I will be ordering another one for my 1 year old. I love these for our small apartment!Very nice and well made. I like that it is a little bigger than my other sheet. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not as thick as my previous sheets.

0,"I read this book after watching John Carter, the recent Disney movie about the Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars.  There are huge differences between the book and movie, the greatest of which is the representation of Dejah Thor is, who is far more the demure and dependent woman in this original text. I intend to read the sequels soon, so it is likely her character will be more developed and powerful in them. Regardless, this is an entertaining look at science fiction written before the common use of airplanes and well before the public expectation of space travel, and a clever story of one man's journey through danger and death on a foreign world. Burroughs has a distinct writing style in his Tarzan stories and this as well, but his descriptions are excellent and his male characters, at least, are developed and noble."

1,"I was hesitant to read this book, as it seemed too preachy for my taste. I wasn't impressed. I liked the story and the characters, but it was boring. The author seemed to be trying to get the reader to love her characters. The writing style seemed a bit too choppy and choppy. There was a lot of dialogue and the story didn't quite get to the heart of it. It was like a well-written story that was written in a very short time. I liked the ending and it was nice to see a hero come back and save the world. The characters were too likable and the story was just too much like a story to me. I loved the ending and didn't like the ending at all. I don't know if I'd have read it again if I wasn't so absorbed in the story. I really did like the ending. I read the story for a week and it just did not seem worth it. I would recommend this to anyone. I've read all of the James Patterson books. I've enjoyed the first one a lot and loved the last one."

The book is about the social structure of the world, and it is written in a way that will appeal to a wide range of people.

0,"I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. Cheaper than even a fleabag motel. So keep an eye out for specials. The view was great, the location was prime. The staff was helpful. The room was large (we had 2 double beds). I only have one complaint. Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (I think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. Fortunately, the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. It was just a little weird. Overall, a great stay and I will definitely stay there again."
0,"This was a very captivating and enjoyable novel.  Young takes us back to Old Town and Haymakers for one exciting and emotionally provocative tale.  Her vivid descriptions and down to earth storytelling transported me to Jersey alongside the characters.  Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.  This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down.  I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better.  Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.  As a whole, this was a fantastic novel that wrapped up this series nicely.  Im definitely sad to have hit the end of the Wilde brothers saga, but it was a fantastic journey while it lasted.  Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."

I gave four stars because I wanted to finish this book, and I look forward to finishing the series.  Its a darker book than I expected to ever enjoy reading, and I can't say that enjoyment is the right word. But I did find the tale riveting, and I want to know what Jorg does next. I guess that says as much as anything could that Lawrence did a great job."
0,"The factory ""calibration"" differs dramatically on these. I got two and both display very different colors. Even with adjustment, they are still different. Maybe it is the backlight on one of them. Nice thin bezel. 100mm VESA mount. Got both mine for 119 and 6 months apart. Don't overpay. No ghosting.  Cons - Wiggles when hit. the two I got are at different heights (off by .5mm). I just put some folded paper to raise one. One of them shipped without the screw to attach the base. I just used one I had laying around instead. The led flashed at night VERY BRIGHTLY if the monitors are on. I covered up the LEDs with two layers of duct tape. This is inconspicuous if done properly and helps with the light. Stand is a little big, but not too noticeable."

On the third week this amp started to act up, would not stay off, keeps turning itself on. Only way to turn off was to unplug it. Was still within return period and got a full refund."

I also like the fact that the sides are made of a metal material and not plastic. I would recommend them for anyone with an occasional rustic kitchen. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it works!  I used it to make a batch of a New England coffee for my son to make into a couple of quickies. He is very pleased with the design and the quality. I am happy with it and will buy it again. This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth it to keep it at a room temperature, but I have it on my mattress with no problems. I wish it had a small, low profile cover that was just right for my husband to put on his pillow for a few minutes of sleep."

There is no deep thinking or new discoveries within the covers, and if you are looking for a ""destination"", you will not find one. But if you are willing to enjoy a small journey into the land of brands then you will find beauty and grace and be rewarded for that. A refreshing read, some of the things we all know, some are new found discoveries.... My company is doing web and graphic design and multimedia, and lots of our people like this book very much."

The personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. Each night, we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. The personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and I to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away."

0,"Keyboard cover review  I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.  The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.  I like having the cover. I like how super thin it is and the protection it offers. Typing with any keyboard cover requires some getting used to. I really wish the letters and number on each key were illuminated, thats my only complaint."

0,"MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.  Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.  I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.  It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!  I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.  I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.  I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for a review on my blog."

0,"I have the standard Litter Genie, and I think it's the greatest! I don't understand the negative reviews--in one, it almost sounds like the person was trying to empty their whole litter box into the Genie. Cleaning the litter box will never be a pleasant experience (until my cat starts pooping gold nuggets!), but Litter Genie makes the process neat and easy. I simply use the provided scoop, pick the box clean, and ""flush"" the collection down into the collection bag. No problems and no odor! I am very sensitive to litter box odor, and there has been none since I got my Litter Genie. Replacing the bags is a breeze, too. Inside the compartment is a cutter--simply pull the bag down from the refill so there is enough to tie a knot in the top of the filled bag. Remove the filled bag. Then, make your new bag by simply tying a firm knot in the cut end of the plastic, forming the bottom of your new bag. Pull down enough material to fill the compartment, close the container, and you're done.  I have one, and occasionally two, cats inside and two litter boxes. Even with two cats, one bag will last me 2-3 weeks. I use natural corncob litter, which is easy to scoop. Very little unused litter gets into my Litter Genie. I don't find it necessary to use a hack for the replacement bags. The refills are reasonably priced since I don't have to change the bag every day (like some reviewers said they were doing). It's easy to carry the Litter Genie between litter boxes because there is a convenient carrying opening on the back, near the top. I have never had trouble with it coming apart while I was carrying it.  I like my Genie so much that I'm going to buy another one, just because I'm lazy and don't want to tote the one I have to the second litter box! I am very, very pleased with my purchase."

I've been wearing it a couple of days and I'm very pleased.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the sneaker and it fits him so well.  He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time.  I love the material and the look of it.  The only thing I would say is it's not just the front that's too tight but it is a bit loose on his face.  He says it's made of stretchy fabric and it's soft.  It's a nice color and I think it will be a great purchase for him.  I have no regrets about buying this.  We just love the quality of this sandal.This is my second pair of this brand of sandals.

0,"I loved this short story, but I wish it had been longer.  It had the makings of the beginning of a full novel.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the previous full novels in the series, I say you should read this short story for completeness if nothing else.  It is really worth the read because it seems to give details that will probably matter later in the series.  Have at it because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The characters are good as always.  I already started the next book at the time I am typing this review because this story was so short."

Comes with the little Sylveon figure and 4 booster packs which I found pretty cool. Really loved it so much that I took a picture of it on my Instagram haha.

0,"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere. What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor. The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts. Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them."
1,"The reader does have to go back and read the earlier books in the series, but this one is a keeper. The story moves at a brisk pace and the characters are strong and interesting.

0,"I got this bouncer with free shipping, so very good deal. This bouncer is a nice with decent size we can put it indoor. We used electric pump and took less than 30 min to pump it. It has been in our living room for more than 2 months without the need of repumping even many kids have been to our home and played on it. It is big enough for two small kids (5 and 7 years old to play in it). We also tried filling it with 400 balls or so to let the kids to have another fun. My son has low muscle tone, at first, he scared of playing inside. Then I used a candy reward to ask him jump inside to pick it, he then have fun in picking the candy inside the bouncer. So far, all the kids (less than 7 years old) who have come to our home enjoyed this bouncer. We think this is a good buy."

My heart ached for them and I cheered for them all along. Fortunately they survived and got their happy ending. I guess sometimes love is stronger than any obstacle ;) The best part of it was that Parsley wasn't weak damsel in distress.

The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written. There is a lot of sex and love in this book. I would recommend it."

0,My son loves this toy since we got it for him when he was 6 months. He would play with it while we got his food ready or cleaned up.

However for the price it was good while it lasted. And he still enjoys spinning it.

0,"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.  Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.  Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder."

0,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience. The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel. Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride. The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. I don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby, the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. The pool/spa/excercise room was not very impressive either. It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor, wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. There is also no hot tub and the 'spa' is a closet with a massage table. The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the 'sheraton promise' phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. The beds were super comfortable. I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago."
0,"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.  Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.  I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."
1,"This review is for one of the free books in this series.  This is the first book in the series.  The second book is also free.  This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.  This book was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.  I was not disappointed in this book.  It was a good story.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  The characters were well written.  I was very excited to read the next book.  This is the second book in the series.  I really liked this book.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  I was glad to see that"

I especially liked the use of words from ""our"" languages, altered to reflect the passage of time.  It's a detail many ""colony of earth"" sci-fi writers ignore or bungle. I can't say the mystery enthralled me, I figured the second biggest mystery about half-way through the book.  The ""whodunnit"" part was weak, but this book is worth reading purely for the philosophy of the Triumphantes. It's a believable world, and the characters are well-drawn.  I don't regret buying it."

0,"I bought this unit a couple years ago, and it is great. I use it often (mostly streaming or playing off my phone or laptop). When plugged in to the AC adapter, it is plenty loud. I use it to play songs I practice my bass to, and it's loud enough to keep up with a Hartke stack. I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though."

The historical background of the women is very interesting, and the descriptions of the relationships between the women are well researched."

0,"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...]. One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it! When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally. Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched. A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way. I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year. I'd encourage anyone to try this out,it's a good one.  JUST DON'T PINCH OR PULL ON THE WIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

She is 2 now and carries it with her every where.  To daycare, for a car ride, to the store, Grandma's....every where.  She left it at her Nanny's once.  That was a difficult night.  I'm going to order a second so that we can rotate.  It's very hard to get the pink doggie washed. My daughter doesn't let it out of her sight very long.  It has worn well.  Washes great.  I have even dried in dryer to ensure she could have it ready for nap."

Because of this, I have been very invested in Charlotte and Thomas's triumphs and tribulations. Thank You Anne Perry for finally having Thomas deservedly recognized and appreciated. I didn't see it coming. Mostly because it contradicts how AP projected their future in a piece she wrote for Otto Penzler. (The Lineup).One of Anne's idiosyncrasies are her endings, which tend to be very abrupt to the point of not providing closure and catharsis. This one does, even though I still wanted it to go on and on! If the mantel is passed to Jemima and/or Daniel in the next one it would be fine with me.

The handle is nice and strong. It's easy to hold and carry. The leash is very flexible and easy to change. I've never had any issues with the dog pulling on it or it breaking.

0,"This is a great hotel! From the doorman who greeted us as we arrived, to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine, everyone was very friendly and helpful. We were 'strangers but for a minute!' The room was extremely clean, well appointed and we had a pretty view of the Chicago River, especially enjoyed from the large window seats. Loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll! Hallways were large and quiet. The restaurant next door, South Water Kitchen is very nice too. The location is in walking distance of the theatres, parks, the river (take a cruise), Michigan Ave. It's ideal. The only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful. For a self-sufficient traveler, you wouldn't really need their services (although it is nice) but for someone coming to Chicago for the first time, a concierge can be very helpful. I would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it."

0,"I love lava lamps, but this is a terrible ""tank"" for a Betta. It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank."

It gave some detail in the beginning of the movie (his anguish, tormented life), to keep you hooked to the end. As in his (Poe's) books; the fast-beating heart, time ticking away fervently, and turmoil to keep you always on the edge of your seat, was done well.  At times (Poe) could come off as being too brash.  But inevitably, you wound up feeling sorry for him. Each piece of the plot gently wound it's way to a complete story that would of course only end the Edgar Allen Poe way."

0,"Habits we all have them, we all use them  but we all don't know why or how.  Yet our habits, many would say, rule us. They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.  This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.  A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them. Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.  The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.  A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring."

0,"I was so excited to see this Toy back on the market. This adorable huggable breathing Golden Retriever Puppy was very popular back 6 or 7 years ago. It was a gift to me from my husband, but my little 3 year old Grand-daughter was fascinated with just watching it lay there and breathe like a real sleeping puppy. She would just stand and watch it for hours. Over the years, she has loved this little puppy named, ""Honey"". During all her visits over the years, it was one of her favorites. It finally stopped working, and we could not fix it. My Grand-daughter said if I ever found another one, she would really love to have it for her own. I found it here on Amazon. The exact one that she wanted. I just gave this Puppy to her on her 10th birthday, and she is thrilled. She lost her real dog, so this sleeps on her bed with her at night. It came in it's own adorable Puppy bed, with a brush, a tagged collar, and real adoption papers to fill out. She is thrilled. It is very well made and very real looking. I would say any child over 3 or 4 would love to have this Huggable Breathing Puppy to sleep on their bed with them at night. This made one little girl very happy."

0,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.  My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.  This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.  UPDATE I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"

1,"This place was absolutely foul. From the minute I walked in, I knew making a reservation here was a mistake. The person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like I was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in. The room we requested (a room with double beds) was not available. They told me that when I made the reservation, requesting double beds was a 'request' and not a 'guarantee.' What's the point of making a reservation, then? When we got to the room, the room was totally gross. The decor was dated, the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy. The bathroom had spots and stains all over it. I hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets. The 'complimentary' fitness area was a joke. One broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells. Thanks but no thanks. We will definitely not return."
0,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.  Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.  A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season."

I was very excited to receive the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set from Learning Resources for review.  My students LOVED this activity set.  It was in my small group centers for a couple of weeks.  They kept asking for it.  There were a lot of things that they liked about it.  They loved that they were like puzzles, especially since the mats are the shapes of bugs.  The boys especially loved this fact.  My students loved how brightly colored the shapes were and that there were many different shapes to play with.  As a teacher, there were many things I liked about the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set.  I loved the variety of shapes that are included.  I really like that the shapes are transparent.  This way the students can easily see if they have placed the shape correctly.  I really loved the variety of activities on the cards.  Some of the activities on the cards are placing the shape where it goes, combining shapes to make other shapes, and sorting the shapes by similar and different attributes.  These are things tShapes Don't Bug Me Collagehat students are required to learn in the kindergarten core curriculum.  I love that these activities applied directly to what my students are learning in class.  Most of all, I loved that my students loved to play with them.  I loved that the students were having fun but were learning as well!  This activity set would be great to have at home.  It teaches important shape concepts and the kids will love playing with it!

I have been using this toy for several years.  I will be buying another for the puppy soon.My dog is the most picky eater I have ever seen.  I give her a lot of treats and I give her a lot of treats because she loves to eat so much.  She is eating about 1/4 cup every day, which is about half the size of a regular food.  It is definitely a healthy food for her and she eats it without hesitation.  I am going to give this 5 stars because it is not too expensive.

0,"My cat needed lysine - but she didn't like it in any form (capsule mixed into her food, gel, chew).  This one was the best - she will eat it sometimes, if I break it into 2-3 pieces, unlike the vet's chews, which cost a good deal more and were completely rejected.  This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.  Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much)."

0,"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke."

0,"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent). Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure. Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar. To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try."

The box was filled with a lot of metal and it was hard to get the tools out. I had to use some of the tools with the edge of the tool to get it out. The box was very heavy so I had to get some extra tools to get it out of the box. I ended up using a bit of a small bit of wood to get the tools out. They were very well made and the tool bag was very easy to use. The tool bag is very heavy so it takes a lot of work to get it out of the box."

0,"Psychologist Daniel Hughes has done it again with his newest book, Attachment-Focused Parenting. In his highly-skilled and talented manner, Hughes has managed to take the complex terms and concepts of attachment theory and make it accessible for the reader. Hughes helps us to better appreciate that the parent-child relationship is a two-way interaction, with each being greatly influenced and affected by the other. Of equal importance, he helps the reader to see that parenting goes way beyond guidance and discipline; rather, both parent and child require a context for understanding what happens between them, and each is influenced by their own history.  Hughes relies extensively upon examples and real-life scenarios as he makes his points. In doing so, he appeals to a wide spectrum of parents. That is, he cites the example of a four-year-old who screams with frustration, while later addressing the parent-child struggles of a 16-year-old. Independent of age, however, the concepts Hughes lays out are universal for all children, regardless of age.  Get ready, though, as Hughes reminds us that the parent's own attachment history greatly affects the parent-child relationship. This certainly isn't new, as how often have we caught ourselves saying, ""I never thought I would say/do what my father/mother did..."" Without writing a self-help book for parents, Hughes proposes some questions and concepts parents should ask themselves about their own history, given the part it plays in raising their kids.  As a child psychologist who primarily works with foster and adopted children and their families, I continually deal with kids who have their own attachment issues to work through. While a professional can assist a child in this regard, much of the work to be done centers on the child's relationship with her parent, be it foster, adoptive, or birth. Because of this, Hughes' book will be at the top of my reference list for the parents I work with, but also for other professionals."

I'll give him credit for that, but not much else.  The way Obama grinds though flag officers makes me wonder how much longer the military system will continue to produce the highly competent high level Generals and Admirals we must have to stay safe in a world that seems to hate us for who we are.  Thankfully there are people like Bob Gates who will lead and endure the realities of public life for the sake of our country."

0,"THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told I'd be getting a king bed. When I check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. I protested to no avail. When I got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago. For the pleasure, I paid the same price as a normal king bed room. The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. We would wake up with body aches and headaches. My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. Not good. Also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in. It's not really worth it. ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. Some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. They would also come at vastly different times. HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime. I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. No other hotel I've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. Late checkout? charge. Shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. The front deck 'gold passport' people can't even figure out how to get you points. In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again). By the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. The bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. The food is edible too, but I wouldn't brag about it. The hotel is not directly on the main street (Michigan), but it's not too far from it. It's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the Navy Pier. Our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park. It's a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though. If you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to Wildberry on Randolph st. It'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! CONCLUSION I get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western. Save the money and stay elsewhere."
0,The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.  Overall though it is a a very good machine though.

1,"I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online. However, my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations. When I arrived, well over an hour of check in time, I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in. The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs, and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd, there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down (after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue). As I am a fairly light sleeper, I woke up several times throughout the night. I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep. Overall the hotel looked very nice, but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room."

0,"Best locking clutch i've encountered. The price deterred me from purchasing one of these for about a year, particularly since the non-locking clutches are noticeably cheaper. But I'm in love with how well this secures my bike. Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own. Although solid, the price is still a lot for a locking clutch, especially if you want to purchase two to transport multiple bikes, which why i'm giving it four stars."

0,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.  The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind."

0,"Directed by Burt Reynolds, with a local boy's eye for interesting locations, this has to be one of the better Elmore Leonard adaptations. A slightly grim tone adds realism. Cast: Charles Durning, Candice Bergman, George Segal, Burt and many other recognisable faces. Every character has something to offer to the involving storeyline. Good work by all. Dar Robinson...one of the stuntmen elite at the time, plays an albino gangster, and does a groundbreaking stunt at the end of this film. Good toughguy Burt action. Enjoyable and well done."

The story itself is good with lots of turns and I was left guessing MANY times. This was not a predictable mystery which I really liked and which made me keep wanting to read to know what happened. I felt it did have a couple dry parts or parts that SEEMED repetitive, but those parts were quickly redeemed. I would highly recommend this book."

0,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.  ""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.  Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.  ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept."

0,"Swisses Chicago: Nice, but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront. A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city, but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. No free WiFi here ,or affordable breakfast, or a free swim in the pool. Just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet, an on average $25 plate for breakfast, and another 15 bucks a night for the 'fitness center.' I've stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. Get with it - this is 2009! No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway, but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. Coffee, milk, OJ; stale donuts, ,muffins, maybe some cereal. Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. With regards to swimming, this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly. This all makes the $6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain. Summation: Drop the fees, the nickel dimming of folks, and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel."

So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone  The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.  Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."

She thought she could never have her mate but things soon change for Mags and Clay. I loved this couple and seeing their relationship take shape made for a nice read. The two are great together. Love is something that cannot be denied and the two face this fact and soon fight for it.  Not only do we get to watch a beautiful relationship develop but we also get to see the action and suspense with everyone trying to figure out and stop the killings. It was nice to see the other characters from past books and seeing how everyone interacts with one another.   I enjoy how each author continues this story line but makes it their own without losing the feel of the series. I am pulled in and always want to return for more.  I received this book in exchange for an honest review."
1,"Two of my four cats (Cats 1, 2, 3) love these treats!  They are so soft and absorbant, and they're the perfect size for a 4 pound cat. I can't imagine a cat would ever use them as a treat. The cats also love the peanut butter flavor, and it's a great way to keep their teeth clean. They're just not big enough for a dog, and they don't like a hard toy like a tennis ball. My cats are not very picky about treats, and it's not just the treats that are good for them. They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around. It does not look too small, but it does not have the same amount of room to move around.

0,"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY."

0,"The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic story about what happens to a foolish puppet who does not listen to the wise advice of others and who disobeys his unselfish father Geppetto.  From the moment he comes to life Pinocchio causes trouble.  He chooses not to listen to the Talking Cricket, a black-bird, a Parrot, and a Fairy with blue hair.  Pinocchio encounters a (supposedly) lame Fox and a (supposedly) blind Cat who dupe him into putting money in the (alleged) Field of Riches.  After skipping school Pinocchio narrowly escapes a vicious police dog and a hungry green fisherman.  Pinocchio becomes a donkey (Collodi makes good use of symbolism here!) as a result of his visit to Funville.  The donkey becomes lame after tripping in a circus act.  A man comes along to purchase the lame donkey so the animal's skin can be used to make a drum.  After being thrown into the sea with a stone around his neck the donkey changes back into a puppet.  Pinocchio is then swallowed by a shark and discovers that his father has suffered the same fate.  Father and son both escape and Pinocchio becomes a real boy.  The moral of this story is fairly clear: Our bad decisions and foolish choices have negative consequences.  Though this story is targeted to children (boys in particular) the lessons presented in this book can apply to adults as well.  The version of this story in this review is an adaption and is designed for younger readers.  However, adults will enjoy this wonderful story about a classic literary character and the error of his ways.  The book concludes with a brief biographical sketch of Carlo Collodi."

0,I purchased this lego set for my almost two year old daughter.  It really is a cute lego set and reasonably priced.  My daughter is not yet at a point where she can (or wants to) build with legos.  This is a perfect set for her to grow into.  She can play with the animals and later use them for building.

0,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand I'm sure it will stay with me, if only because it has provided me with a vivid picture of what the mental life of somebody I know may be like. On the other hand I did not care for the writing ...  ... starting with the title, whose intriguing promise is not in any way, that I can see, kept, Naturally the title brings to mind Sherlock Holmes. And the connection is indeed drawn in the book, which, very annoyingly to my mind, relates the main plot of the relevant Conan Doyle novel, which I would have been motivated to reread after all these years had it only been alluded to rather than completely revealed (and to no good purpose that I can see). And what does it have to do with THIS novel? Not much. Just about the only plot element that was keeping me interested was the detective mystery, but, bizarrely, this is blown up rather early in the game ... admittedly thereby introducing a different and also intriguing plot element, but not intriguing enough to assuage my disappointment at the demise of the detective element.  The writing is lacking also in that there are contradictions in the text and sometimes the characters do things that I simply could not believe.  The main problem with the writing, though, is one of the things that gives the book its strength, namely, conveying what I presume is an autistic-like mind. Unfortunately the author is not enough of a stylist to prevent me from mentally shouting, OK, enough already, I get it. It became tedious for most of my read.  I will credit the book and story with a strong double message: It shows that some people are capable of unconditional love (and some are not), and happiness is not to be found."

0,"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views. All in all a good book worth reading but has to be supplemented with further readings on the post-war Soviet Union subject."

1,I used this product to replace an old one that had a cold weather breaker that I had just broken.  The old one had a solid steel plate that was not easily affected by the cold.  I replaced the old one with a new one.  This is a great product for the money.  I have a few of them in the house and they are very strong.  They are very bright and very easy to use.  The only thing I would change is the price.  I bought this for a friend who has a house in which he uses a thermostat that uses a heater and a generator.  He was skeptical at first but after some research he decided to give this one a try.  He has used it in the past and likes it so much
0,"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders..."

Has the ability to make the instep area tighter or looser as necessary and the heel area is velcro and can be lengthened or shortened if need be.  The strap across the foot is also ajustable for making just the right fit.

0,"Judy Holiday won an Oscar for this film, and no wonder: her performance of Billie Dawn, a ""dumb broad"" who suddenly wises up in a most unexpected way, is certainly one of the finest and most original film performances in 20th Century American cinema. The story, from the stage success, concerns a crass junk yard tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who goes to Washington to buy a Senator--and promptly considers that his blonde-bimbo mistress Billie Dawn (Holiday) lacks enough poise for such refined circles.  He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to ""smarten her up.""  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light. The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.  The film very neatly balances its comic elements with its serious side, and neither predominate nor throw the film off center; director Cukor steers a perfect course.  A must-see and a must-own."

That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow.

Adding small measures of water to a container does not show up consistently, so you will see a jump every 50-100 grams while slowly adding something. Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.  I like the style and apparent built quality, the glass top makes it very easy the clean in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, it is wildly inaccurate at the gram-scale, and unreliable at ounce-scale, and only useful for lbs/kgs.

The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.  Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.  Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.  Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.  We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.  So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.  I hope this review has been helpful!"

1,"I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend, and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. The spacious rooms with modern, innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small, dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. The bathrooms were neat, tidy, and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper, shampoo, and soap. The carpet was clean (not stained and dingy like some hotels), the room decor was astounding, and the view from our window was wonderful. I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay, from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. Thanks for making me feel right at home!"

They're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag (treats and directions to an off-leash area), and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog's names on it."

0,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.  It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.  The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.  This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

0,"I liked both Taylor and Lucas. Lucas was a strong, honorable man from the west and Taylor was a fine lady who wasn't only what she appeared to be. I really enjoyed the story and felt there was a lot of action in this one. I was a bit annoyed by both Taylor's and Lucas's reluctance to confide in each other and their ridiculous resistance to the marriage, but I do understand it was expected due to their backgrounds. I wish we'd been able to meet Lucas's brothers. There was a nice little mention of the Emerald and Black Harry from the Crown's Spies Series. Overall, very nice story."
0,"This thing is awesome! I would buy again if I could carry two. I keep finding out things about it. It feels good loaded and believe me I have had it loaded. I will be adding a hydration bladder later. I like the gun holder feature and the fact that you can easily remove the pack from the frame. The zip up pockets on the waste belt are very handy, maps, small binoculars, multi tool etc. seems very well made. I use the shelf for for sleeping bag however, the pack has a sleeping bag compartment. It is basically a pack inside a pack with drawstrings at the top and bottom. If you use the shelf for your bag you can access everything from the bottom. I replaced the the round key ring type things that the pack is attached with with cotter type pins but I understand their idea behind the rings. They are a little quieter. I sprayed it down with Kiwi Camp dry for good measure. As you can tell I am very pleased with my purchase and would give six stars if I could. Next I would like to try their brand of sleeping pad."

0,"""Destroyer Angel"" made me sad. It's not only the violent, depressing story, but also the fact that this may be the last Anna Pigeon novel I read. I have been reading Nevada Barr's books for many years now and have been disappointed in the dark turn this series has taken. I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series, which could never be accused of being ""cozies"", but included wonderful descriptions of National Parks and a variety of realistic characters. I thought the premise of this story being a story of survival sounded intriguing, so I gave it a try. After finishing the book, I can say I liked it better than recent installments such as ""The Rope"", but didn't like it nearly as well as earlier books in this series.  I liked the vivid characterizations of the female characters and descriptions of the setting, but the male villains are interchangeable and their actions are appalling. Having the story told from different points of view added some interest, but also added redundancy and slowed the pace of the book. Some may enjoy this as a story of good vs. evil, but it's not my kind of story and even the great character of Anna Pigeon couldn't save it for me. The author has obviously chosen to take this series in a new direction, so it looks like we may be parting ways."

It can also record my favorite TV shows to watch at a later time. The only thing the A3 needs to be perfect is bluetooth.

0,"Overall, I enjoyed the story. Some of the details/actions were not consistent with the time period. Also, while I think flawed characters make for much better stories, there are better ways to write in the ""flaws"" than having an antagonist point them out at every opportunity. Also, the attempt at romantic tension between the heorine and the male character grated on my nerves. The male character was presented, first to last, as an insufferrable jerk, though the implication was that he's really just misunderstood. He's being an ass to push her away because he really wants to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx....  SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future books by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery readers turning pages. Just, please, drop the annoying romance sterotypes, there are better ways to develop intimacy, meaningful and realistic connections, between characters. (A little more research on the crime element of the time period might help too)."

( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.  This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.  I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.  I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."

Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience."

0,"Having read and enjoyed Jonathan Moellers The Frostborn series, I was eager to dive into his latest release, Hyperspace Demons.  That eagerness was rewarded by a thoroughly enjoyable, action packed story.  As a novella, the story ramps up to speed quickly.  Moeller does a very good job introducing new elements, like hyperspace and its risks, plus the equipment aboard the spaceship, all in the middle of a steady stream of exploits and conflicts the characters must deal with.  Everything comes together in a nice package.  The action is well done and kept me furiously turning pages.  But wait, theres more.  Mixed in with hyperspace and spaceships is the interesting concept of hyperspace microbes that can possess a human mind, driving the person insane.  These microbes are kept out of the spaceship by a special shield, so there shouldnt be any problems, right?  Thats where the plot pulls off some unexpected twists and turns, making for a fun read.  Moeller keeps up the pace all the way to the end.  Amazingly, for a novella there is much more that could be said, but I fear explaining anymore will reveal too much.  Too often, shorter stories leave me feeling unsatisfied.  But not Hyperspace Demons.  Interesting story.  Well told with plenty of action and a surprise or two thrown in.  Good job Jonathan Moeller."

0,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.  The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:  First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.  The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.  So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."

I was intrigued by the characters and their stories.  I really liked how honest Kyra was about the problems former addicts face.  The dynamic between Ellie, Drew, and Jason was very interesting.  I felt bad for her being caught between two of the most important men in her life.  I found Jason and Drew's interactions to be fascinating .  There is a lot of history there and it made for some tense moments as well as emotional ones.  However, only part of it was shared and I'm hoping we'll get more if/when we get Jason's story.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this series develop and getting to know more about the band members and their stories. Kyra has written an emotional story that shows she's done a lot of research.  It's one I thoroughly enjoyed reading."
0,"This film doesn't pretend to be perfect.  It is open about how flawed people move forward amidst the heartbreak that each of us undoubtedly encounter in our fallen world. Instead of a movie saying, ""here is a package that ties with a silk ribbon on top"" it instead says ""walk along with me, I am hurting too, and I am willing to respond in an inclusive manner rather than hardening in my isolation and spitting my hatred all over anyone that comes close""...It is this message that I found refreshing, and maybe even a little inspiring.  If you like independent films for the performances that seem to set celebrities free from micro managed scripts...you will probably like 'Begin Again'."

0,"While not perfect - this one is much better than the others we tried.  It is larger than the other ones tried and holds more soap = less filling.  It has an off switch which is wonderful when moving it or filling it.  There is a wheel on the side where you can adjust the amount of soap that comes out easily.  The only issue I have had is sometimes it takes 2 times of putting a hand under it in order to get the soap to come out.  I bought one for myself and my son and both are still working after 3 months.  That might not sound like much, but the others we tried quit after less time - some not at all.

0,"Replaced a single pole switch with this product. High ceiling made it difficult to control fan light and speeds. This upgrade was simple to install resulting in a compact and modern look compared to the single switch it replaced. I changed all the switches with Lutron products (i.e., dimmer switches) during this project and couldn't be more happier with this decision.  The fan light and speed selection is responsive, the remote unit was small compared to others I have installed making it easy to place in the canopy.  I placed the remote control unit on the wall at the other end of the room with velcro allowing the fan to be controlled at the two main entrances.  I liked this solution so much, I ordered two more units, but unfortunately not from Amazon, since the price increased from $85 to $116 in just two weeks between the time I ordered, installed and wrote this review.

0,"OK, we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating. I can't believe the bad reviews. I got a priceline deal, and I still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (OK a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. Here it is from my point of view. Both rooms on 10th floor. Regarding the size of the rooms. We had two rooms. One was a 2 double bed room. It was about 20' x 15'. Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. The furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. Three separate levels (TV, ice/coffee, and minibar) The other room was called 'Queen executive'. This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two TVs and terry bathrobes. Also about the same size but different configerations. One TV faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. Smoke in the lobby. There is a bar to the right of the entrance. It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. Cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint. Concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does. Was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? Either case, not good. He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect."

0,"I really hated Annabel's family with all my tiny heart and soul. And I did not understand why Annabel just didn't go work in the fields by herself and leave her family to their own devices. That was really odd and kind of annoying.  Other than that, this book was decent enough. It's not the worst one I've ever read. I think there could have been a lot less bashing-you-over-the-head-with-religion, as in, it could have been much more subtly (and thus skillfully) done.  Stephen's character could have been fleshed out a lot more. He was kind of just in the background for most of the time, and so the part that focused on him didn't have as much impact as it could have. I like le Wyse and I liked Annabel, but their relationship was a little ""eh."" I loved Eustacia but thought she talked like Yoda. Most of the language in this book was a little weirdly done. I get that the author was trying to evoke the 1300s, but she didn't pull it off unfortunately. It just came off weird and it was very distracting to read the characters talk like normal people and then say ""Nay."" It reminded me of that John Pinette sketch ""I say nay nay!""  I thought the storyline with the baliff was well done, though I could have lived without Gilbert and Adam's characters. Same with Beatrice - did that actually have a point or not really?  This is a good, light read for when you just need a book that doesn't require your brain to function."
0,"Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in 'lounge' is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star."

0,"While I love an action romance story like everyone else,what I can't get is when the editing is poor that it takes away from the story. This is such a good story with a whole lot of potential,but the need for better editing takes that away. This is sexy sensual romance between two very stubborn and strong willed people. The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe. I love the action between these two characters,I just wish for a tad bit more story and a little more from the supporting cast. The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings. This was a really good solid story,one you can not regret reading. I would love to see a revised version and it be released if possible and with a not so abrupt ending."

0,"This is the final in the series of a long running and great TV show.  The eleventh and twelfth season episodes clearly lack the polish and good story lines of all the other episodes.  James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth seasons is sorely missed.  As good as the new characters are such as William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines.  It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord was not the easiest individual to work with.  His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth.  Without Danno and all the other wonderful personalities around him, he rather fades into background.  The very final episode has Lord as the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat.  The episode quite fell flat (pardon the poor rhyme).  Seasons 1 through ten are stellar."

0,"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints. So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons; 1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into. 2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms. 3. Again I had realistic expectation. 4. I'm into fun stuff 5. I'm sentimental for the old days. look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have. Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious. In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun. But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am."

This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.  When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.  The price of these shoes was outstanding!"

0,"Stayed here for two days while attending Lollopalooza music festival. One of the best locations in Chicago, on Michigan Ave near the Tribune and Sun-Times buildings. An easy walk or bus ride to many attractions. The King sized room was very nice, not large, but with a generous bathroom. Service was excellent throughout. Check out the awesome swimming pool, straight out of twenties."
0,"It is official: vampires are so last year. Kate's Fallen helps lead the way in this new angelic revolution. Novels such as Fallen will easily do for angels what the Twilight series did for vampires.  Fallen was almost exactly what I was hoping it would be. It was dark, romance, and had tons of unexpected plot twists that had me gasping. While there is some room for improvement with the pacing of the novel, the overall premise was amazingly creative. It features a wonderful blend of religious ideals with Kate's fictitious world. Kate has a wonderful way of pulling the reader into the world of Sword & Cross. I constantly found myself thinking I had only read about five pages, only to discover it was closer to twenty. This is due in part to how well Kate explores the world she has created. Every detail has been thought of, and is explained beautifully.  But by far, my favorite aspect has to be the characters. Luce is an interesting heroine. I am really interested to see how she develops since there is a lot of potential with her. And I can't wait to see more of her and Daniel. They are an interesting pair to say the least. While I love those two, it is Cam that really has my attention. He is an alluring mixture of good and evil. I am dying to learn more about him, and his overall role in the plot. In regards to secondary characters, Kate has created some of my favorites of all time, with Penn leading the way. They are funny, creative, and above all else, memorable.  Despite certain plot issues that need to be addresses, I have to say that I am pleased with this novel. It was highly creative, and left me wanting to know me. I can't wait to see what twists await me in the next book."

0,"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No."

0,"I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.  The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.  No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.  UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea."

1,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. What I expected to be a very pleasant experience, turned out to be a stressful visit. We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation. Upon arrival, the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful. As we had no other options, we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds. I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong! There wasn't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. To add insult to injury, the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation, partial refund or related 'perk' to make up for our great inconvenience. Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do! Although we paid for the breakfast package, we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. Pardon the pun, but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel's lack of customer service! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but, thus far, we have received no satisfaction. Needless to say, we will not be visiting this property again! In fact, we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels."

0,"STYLE: Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.  It doesn't have any nylon patches or extra zippered pockets like many others.  The design is clearly more function than fashion, but the overall cut of the jacket is relatively slim.  FIT: I bought this to wear as a second layer under my overcoat and to wear around the office when it gets cold, instead of a cardigan.  I am a shirt size 15.5 32/33 and the medium is a good fit, though it would probably be too tight over a heavy sweatshirt or sweater.  QUALITY: Quality is perfect.  No issues with any zippers or seams.  OVERALL: For the price, this is an excellent product.  I wear it every day and am giving it five stars.  However, if you are looking for something that will make a fashion statement, then I suggest you look elsewhere."

0,"I am probably not the best person to write a review for this book. I love this series when it first came out, and now with each book I just get more and more disappointed. This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance. The sex was typical for these types of manlove books. I was just annoy cause it didn't connect or update on any of the other books in the series. Really this is not a series!!!!

0,"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it. Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it. I only did the bypass for one of three lights just to see if anything changes. Now turned on the lights and I could not notice any difference! No humming noise from the ones with the ballast (not bypassed) either."

The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.  He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).  Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price! I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess. My other cat sneaks some of his food sometimes and it didn't change her poop either.

0,"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.  As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.  The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.  The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.  Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.  I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion."
1,This hammock is the size that will fit the long legs of a Giro bike. It has a nice two-person fold-down design and is light and easy to take on and off. It is also very comfortable to sit on. The construction is very sturdy and the fabric is also very strong. The hammock is made of a very durable material and is very strong. I will say that I will probably not buy this hammock again. I have a hard time finding hammocks that have a strong construction. I would definitely recommend this hammock for anyone who needs a hammock that will last a long time.

I have no idea how to fix this. I will update this post if I find a way to fix it. My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose. If you have a large handle and it's loose you will feel a little pressure on your hands. If you have a large handle and it's loose it will be harder to grip the handle.

Got back my audio! Glad to not be listening to my DTV via my flatscreen's speakers anymore. Can't comment on how long they last, but they DO work."

0,"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one. On the matter of typos: there are a lot, but no more than in an average advanced reader copy. I wish them gone, but I have noticed that the author is donating all the proceeds from the books to the Breast Cancer and Save The Children foundations and professional editors cost a lot."

1,"I really wish I could say that I liked this hotel, but the whole experience was just plain awful. My first warning sign should have been when I made my reservation. The person I spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. At first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel, and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel I was actually wanting, he booked me for the wrong dates. He read me the right dates, and it was only when I called back two days later to confirm that I found out he'd given me the wrong dates. Hilton did get it fixed, but I already had a bad feeling about my stay. Then came actually staying at the hotel. The people at the check-in desk were downright rude. Then there was the room. I was supposed to be in a non-smoking room, but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. The hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. However, I might as well have stayed in the first room. I was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. The sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. Yes, I was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. Since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. The walls were so paper thin, all I could hear all night was barking. When I complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick I shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. Yeah right. I was excited to use the pool, but just like my room, it hadn't been cleaned recently. Then, I tried the fitness center. Half the equipment was broken. I tried to cut my stay short, but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all. They even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness I had to deal with. I will never stay with Hilton again, and I will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was."

I felt like I was reading a story about Holly and her family, but I didn't feel like I was going to enjoy the book, which I did.

With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.  Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.  So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable."

It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable."

1,"My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable. My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me 'in the system'. We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. The room that I had originally reserved (King) was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room. I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service. It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. When finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it. So now I am cranky, tired and starving! I ate what I could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms. The woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago. I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again."
0,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for. Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen. ""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe. Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending. There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more. To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece."

1,"As SENSE & SENSIBILITY (S&S) is an easy read, and I highly recommend it for everyone!  I read this book in the fall of 1999, when I was a student in college. I was a little skeptical of the value of this book. I was interested in the possibilities of the book, but I was also concerned that it would be marketed as a book for the general public. I was quite surprised to see that the author had written a book with a title like ""The Secrets of Your Life"" which is the subtitle. I felt that it was a little too general in a way that it was not. I think it was a good read.  I did not like the cover of this book. I thought the title of the book was too general and I had no idea what the title meant. It was very misleading.

0,".......during this peculiar political season - make it this one.  The whole thing - every page - from beginning to end is sardonic and ingeniusly written.  The humor is not restricted to just one format.  There are hilarious forms to fill out, games to play and paragraphs that made me flat-out laugh and giggle.  The phrasing and timing of each ""piece"" is perfect and if you can imagine some of these spoofs on the show it's even more hysterical.  But you never need to have seen the show to enjoy this book and I mean just enjoy it - page after hilarious page."
0,"I ordered this dress with a little worry over how it would fit and if the color would match the picture. I was not disappointed on either account. It is flattering and fits me just right but since it is flowy and has a little stretch, I don't have to worry about feeling uncomfortable if I gain or lose a couple lbs before I have to wear this dress out. I do agree with other reviewers that I would not go braless in this as it is a bit low-cut but the design of the sleeves and back make this not a problem as a bra can easily be worn without showing. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

However, after assembling it, she went to sit in the chair and she was gigantic for it. We had to send it back. I'm sure it's a great toy, but if your child is on the taller side of a young toddler, don't waste your time or money as the age recommendation should be lower due to the height limitations."

0,"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.  With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.  EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, yes we are using the ""Canine"" Fortiflora for our cats. When we got our first box from our veterinarian they gave us the canine version and assured us that it was perfectly fine to use it for felines as well."

0,"You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.  I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.  Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.  I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.  So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.  But I don't think the cost differential was anywhere near worth the slightly better sound isolation."

0,"We booked through a travel website. This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September. The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done. The hallway was so dimly lit, we couldn't see how to use the key card. The shock came when we entered the room. Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest's comfort into consideration. The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress (rock hard) over a platform. The 'nigh stands' were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height. The room was stark - all off-white, no color. No art work or any decoration at all. The full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit; if it were winter and the heat was on, I think this could be dangerous. There was a desk & chair but no clock/radio in the room; there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection. The bathroom was very small but clean. The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to. An older person could have never stayed in the room. Because of the renovation, there was no restaurant on-site. No vending or ice available on the floor either I can't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel. I would never stay there again."

I got them for a staff member, who was wearing crummy cheap boots while he worked in our barn~ not acceptable. So, we bought him a pair in the style my husband wears. Ariat is the only brand we, as a boot wearing family, ever buy. So, once we got the boots, which was lickety split, of course, with Amazon Prime, we had Vid try them on. They fit exactly the way they are intended. They fit as though your foot is poured into a boot mold. haha. Of course, if they fit correctly, they should be a bit tight the first few times, they weather slowly, and fit your foot, well, like a glove. These were exactly what we had hoped, and Vid was extremely grateful, smiled all day. We are pleased that our staff member finally knows what a quality boot should be, and we're confident he's as comfortable as he can be while he works. That makes everyone happy. Even the horses.

This food actually looks similar to corned beef, minus the white colored fat, this just has a spoonful of congealed juices at the bottom of the can. I did think it would have more gravy in it given its sold as a gravy cravers dog food but that's alright, I can add just a little warm water for gravy. Its mostly a smooth pate of food, except the Filet Mignon, that has slight chunks along with the pate. This doesn't smell nasty, it actually does smell quite good. Similar to canned beef stew. All and all, this is a very good canned food for the price. Its also nice that I can have it shipped to my home with prime. Another thing, I wanted to mention, I've seen the reviews others have left saying their dog had gastrointestinal upsets, mine did not, I think it does vary from dog to dog, but I've not had any issues.  Edited 11/07/2015  I bought several cases since my original review because my dog loves this food and its so easy to just have this delivered to my home. I'm happy, my dog's happy and my cat's are happy they have a box to play in.  Edited Again, 01/30/2016  Been buying this regularly as I cannot find this exact case for sale in local shops. My dog really enjoys this food and it mixes easily with dry food."
1,"Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest. The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. If it wasn't already a bad stay, I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. If they didn't have air conditioning in the room, I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business, I hope you decide not to choose this hotel. I was quite surprised, I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience."

I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."

She gives up on her dreams of a man coming to rescue her and spends the next 600 years haunting the castle were she was killed. However, when Thomas McKinnon arrives to see the castle he purchased in 2001, she  recognizes him as the man from her dreams. At first all Thomas wants to do is restore his crumbling old castle, but he finds himself falling in love with a ghost.

She has a whole series on the MacLeods/MacKinnons/De Piagets. However, I do think that books in a series should be able to stand on their own and this falls a little short. There are too many back stories that need to be explained, and a lot of loose ends that are not tied (presumably these will be explained in later books).   This story does invovle time travel, and ghosts, so it requires a lot of imagination on the reader's part. The relationship between Thomas and the ghost inhabitants of the castle is quite funny and some of the supporting characters are quite likable. I loved the part where Iolanthe uses Thomas's computer to teach the garrison how to read. The part of the story where Thomas rescue's Iolanthe is also quite exciting and romantic. There are no love scenes in this book, only a few kisses and embraces. There is some violence and descritpions of battle scenes. If you like books in a series, I would recommend this book, but if not, then you may want to skip this one. JBogue paper-and-lace Specializing in paranormal romance and fiction"

0,"I bought these despite a previous reviewer concerned with the ""cheap plastic"" not being able to ""dissipate heat"".  The  reason you SHOULD by these lights is because there's no heat to dissipate! That's the beauty of LED's: instead of making light and heat like the halogen lights we're replacing, LED's just make light, hence the energy savings. BTW., if the reviewer is that worried about heat dissipation, he should hurry up and get these because the old halogen lights in recessed ceiling cans get way to hot for my comfort level. Even the heat protection devises to make them safe for installation in attic spaces don't do that good of a job.  Not sure why he had such failure. I'm not sure if LED's can be used outside, in wet exposures. Curious to know how the guy who said they fit in the Malibu (exterior) lights from the boxed store are holding up! I hope well...these would save me a ton of money if I can replace those as well!!"

0,This is a suspenseful story and had lots of twists and steamy scenes. It got kind of dark at a certain point but that just made me want more and more.

0,"Can I please get more?  I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.  Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a character who will say what they feel, and I have been told on many occasions that I need a filter....so I feel as if me and Leslie are one in the same. Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.  Oliver, has scars - both on the outside and inside. That man wound his way into my heart, and I am so grateful that he did.  I cheered for Leslie and Oliver, I cried when I feared things would not end up the way I had hoped, I laughed - a lot.  Susan Mac Nicol has a way with words, and her Men of London are just another reason I want to jump in a plane and plan a trip.......I want to find these guys and hug them all, and never let go.

0,"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.  I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?  I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last."

1,We've owned several camp cooksets and have had the opportunity to take a few of my friends on the trip.  The quality is spot on.  The basic design is solid and it's easy to set up and use.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a camp stove for the money.  I have a portable stove and I can use it on my stove as well.  I just wish there was a way to access the stove from the back of the car so I can take it out of the car without having to pull it out of the car.  I have a spare stove and it is a good price for the equipment it comes with.  It is a very good starter kit and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a starter kit for their stove.Great quality.

My wife and I just needed to use the wrench to get it to come off. The package was very easy to assemble. It was a little difficult to find a way to turn the wrench so I took it out of the package and put it on the bike. It was a pain to remove the wrench. It will work in the future.

The conversations between characters didn't feel like any conversations I have heard before, not at all believable.  Almost like reading a book badly translated from another language.  Weird.  You wanted to sympathize with Tony because he was trying to do the right things for his daughter, but his thought process didn't fit his character.  Cassi is sometimes way to flakey to be believable.  The book is rather disappointing."

0,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality. There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe. Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

I promised myself I'd read just a chapter or two a day, to savor what I knew would be a staggeringly good thrill ride.  The twists and turns and revelations got the better of me, I finished the book the second day.  I love how Sookie is a pawn and yet, so much more self-possessed and in control in this novel than previous ones.  The series reminds me, the only thing you can count on is change, and the best we can all do is adapt.  Sookie Stackhouse, I hope you live forever!"

0,"I purchased this light when it was on sale for $29.00 and I wish I had ordered more because I love it and all my friends love it. When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door. Update!  I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully: Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors."

1,"I would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep. I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July. I had a select king city view room. The room was dark, with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view. I was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow. The hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long, so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there. When I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did. I ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door. They quieted down for about an hour, but then were loud again for the rest of the night. The hotel was expensive, and for the price there weren't very many special amenities. There was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $10 a day. Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago, as it is way overpriced for what you get."

The front of this tent is the most attractive to me and it is comfortable to stay in.  The poles are very sturdy and hold up to some heavy use.

If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade. Also, given that garden tools have heavier tougher blades, this tool does sometimes loosen up during rigorous sharpening. I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit before using this sharpener. But, for the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."

1,"What I liked: -Soren. I liked this book, as it was a little more of a thriller than a mystery. There was a lot of intrigue and drama in the beginning, but it was pretty straight forward. -The relationship between the two main characters. This was a bit of a surprise, but it was pretty good. I did get a bit of a bit of a kick out of it, but I didn't feel like I was getting any real closure. It was a bit of a surprise to me, but I did enjoy it. -The characters. I liked them. There were a lot of characters. I really liked the way they were introduced. I liked the way they came to be. I liked how they were portrayed. I liked the way they were portrayed. -The social aspects. I liked the way they were portrayed. I liked the way they were treated. I liked the way they were treated. I liked the way they were treated.

0,"Reed is a bear shifter totally opposed to getting close to a witch.  Other shifters might  choose to bond with witches but no way was he making that mistake.  Monica was just as adamant that witches and shifters had no business bonding together.  Her best friend can nag her all she wants but Monica wasn't going down that path.  No way!  Naturally, fate has a sense of humor and brings these two co-workers together one day at the office.  Neither is aware that the other is anything more than human.  Anticipation is delicious!  I held my breath waiting for the moment when Truth dawned on them.  After the reality ""hit the fan"", so to speak, then the story takes off at breakneck speed as they struggle with their feelings and who knew that a fight with a demon could clear the air so well.  Falling for the Bear is well written, beautiful and delightful.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.  Five stars."
0,"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.  I hope Vantec will see this review for the next design model."

0,"We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.  We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.  I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!"

0,"has gone downhill so much we almost checked out. We stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in Chicago. We've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula, it has always been a comfortable and clean, service oriented hotel. Not only has room service been eliminated (if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street, so is ONLY Italian), complimentary morning coffee is no longer available, mini bars have been removed from the rooms, etc. etc. The only restaurant, the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night, the bar also, so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests. Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations, but we weren't told of it. We also learned that the bell staff (who have been there for 13 and 8 years) is being eliminated. So, in other words, anyting to do with 'service' is gone from this hotel. I hear they are going to begin renovations in December, but that is no excuse to let an old glory 'go to pot' in the meantime. We won't be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving. We even had to pay for internet. Mind you, our bill for 3 nights was 900.00+, no room service, no restaurant/bar charges. Highway robbery for what you get ow at the Ambassador East. Sad."

Ten minutes later after standing there with my suitcase, the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software. She told us to wait until the computers booted back up. I asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they couldn't activate the cards. Finally another 20 minutes later the computers were up and I finally got my room. Wheres the 'luxury' in waiting 35 minutes for a room?

Everyone must make difficult choices, but in this case some become important in the whole scheme of things. I liked the story without knowing more details on who the old man was or what his life was before. I took everything at face value in the story, and I enjoyed the read.

0,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.  The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.  I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.  The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!  I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."

0,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".   Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.   The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).   All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."

The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son, and the doorman watched on doing nothing. Me and my girlfriend are young, look young in how we dress, but in all honesty make more money than most...and we were treated like cheap poor kids.

0,"I needed a fun and exciting way to workout while I am stuck in my ""ice palace"" during winter. Seriously my driveway gets too slippery to drive down so for much of the winter months I am stuck inside.  Zumba is fun, love the music and so does my one year old son who dances and tries to follow along with me.  Almost instant results happened for me. I started feeling better and happier after the first run through. I noticed weight begin to slip off little by little and suddenly I was at my pre baby weight in two weeks! I get that results like that are not too common, but stress was holding the weight on me and Zumba really helped my stress levels.  Fun and exciting. I am a big fan!!!"

0,"I am technologically challenged and need my son's help to do most everything electronics related. I bought this switch with the idea that if I could not make it work I would ask my son for help. I have a TV with only two HDMI ports and needed to connect it to a DVD and a Roku as well as my cable modem. Guess what! By following the advice in other reviews, I have a working setup. I still don't understand what the 5v charger input is supposed to do or why the ""Select"" button doesn't select. Also, I don't need to use the remote control (I already have a handful of remotes and don't want to juggle another). It seemed to take forever to get the switcher, but considering the price and the utility of the thing, I am a happy buyer."

0,"My primary use for this toolbox is to keep inside of my truck.  I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.  This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.  The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.  With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.  The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.  I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother. I can look in my box and see exactly what i need and where it is. No more moving stuff around to get at the tool that I need.  I plan on looking into more of excel's products."

So far, this seems to be working better.  Read the directions, though. This stuff dissolves and expands as it gets wet. 1"" in the bottom of the box would have been sufficient. I added too much the first time."

0,"The bar does not fit into the two ends snuggly.  This is I can live with since this is the only bar whose depth fits into the space I have available in my bathroom for a towel bar.  However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now."

0,"I acknowledge, that I ordered these boots and others very quickly, as I got a great promotional price.  However, I did not realize that everything but the shoe part itself is quilted cloth! I honestly cannot believe it. However, it does say this in the written description. Also, the buckle is barely noticeable and it does not stand out at all. I had just ordered a Ralph-13 in pewter, and these are very different.  They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.  Honestly, these remind me of snow boots I may have worn as a kid. I definitely do not feel they are worth the money that is shown. I will keep them only because I got such fantastic deals on a number of boots."

1,Very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view. The dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago. I have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this. I am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well. The shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors. The biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed. I give the hotel a 5 out of 5.

0,"First off I'd say this book is more about spies, personal relationships, and naval life that includes submarines. It's action is sporadic and doesn't go far enough. If your looking for an action packed sub story then this book won't meet your expectations. If occasional sub action filled with soap opera drama is for you then by all means read this book. I gave it three stars because there were some highlights, just that they came here and there throughout the story."

This is the professional kind of writing that just puts you right into the story and pulls you along to the end. My only problem is that I didn't understand what happened in the end.

It isn't as easy as other helicopter products to land but it does it well, remote is very responsive and found myself wanting to buy one after using it for a few minutes at his birthday party. I plan on looking to see if they have other characters I can buy so I can purchase more for others, great price so I don't mind buying it."
0,"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version.  In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more  fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and  some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director.  Might be  worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which  eventually will happen."

0,"I bought an 8 pack of these and have been replacing the CFL bulbs in the house as they burn out.  I've been much happier with these.  Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.  I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.  They have a nice glow to them rather than the harsh LED light you might be familiar with if you bought some of the earlier or cheap ones.  Try these, you'll love them, save power, and change bulbs much less often.  Win, win, win."

0,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but ran into a case where I wasn't even able to get these working. Here's the situation:  These where to be installed at the top and bottom of a flight of stairs. The top switch shared a junction box with another 45609 switch which controlled a different circuit.  I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.  I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.  Nothing he nor I did ever resolved this issue, and i eventually had to put the original switch back in.  So please be aware that there are some fringe cases where these switches aren't going to work."

The rooms, in my opinion, appeared different then pictures and were worn and ratty...you know, uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area... the first room I was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my window!!I kid you not; they seemed as if they were about 15-20 ft from my window!! And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent view..I was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly, again... just worn out!!!NOT a 4 star hotel, this seemed to be closer to a 2, perhaps being extremely kind 3 star...I travel on business so I know the difference...I merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand! I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit, she made sure the door was fixed ASAP. They gave me a bottle of wine to compensate..which I utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 days....I wanted to give Omni a shot...big mistake...

The manual is awful, and can't find anything on the website to help. Very misleading as to what this can do. No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps."

It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4).

1,"It's no surprise that the film has been hailed as a classic, as it is a strong one.  But the film's most famous film is the fight between the two leads, played by Christopher Walken and Keanu Reeves, as they are trying to overcome the two men who are leaving a woman in a wheelchair to save her mother.  The film is so brutal that it is difficult to understand why it took Reeves so long to get the film off the air.  But it is a compelling one.  ""The Hood"" is one of those films where the camera is shooting it's moments of terror.  The film is shot with great accuracy, and the actors are superb as they take to the screen to make the film feel real.  I've seen it many times before, and I never saw it as a horror film.  There are so many movies that feel like they have to make the viewer feel alive.  The film has a strong atmosphere of suspense and of being at the mercy of the viewer.  The film's music is intense, and the suspense is so intense that"

0,"Was there recently for one night for a conference. Tried to check-in at 5:30pm (the published check-in was 3pm), they said my room wasn't ready, where as others coming after me were assigned rooms. Was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready. I chilled there until 8pm, no call, so went out for dinner. Came back at 9:30pm and asked if my room was ready. The gal said of course yes and give me a key. When asked why no one called me, she just shrugged. No, my troubles did not end there. I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room. Came back to the lobby, then they apologized and gave me another room. I said I was not going to walk-in on somebody else again, so they sent someone with me to open the new room. For all my 'trouble' they reduced my bill by about 40%. It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru. Very bad experience."

0,"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.  At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.  If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.  If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo."

0,"I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.  Oh, and the magnets on the earbuds are a nice bonus."

0,"Please visit my blog for more reviews! :) [...]  Delirium was a delightful read! I had just finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and so Delirium was a great book to read while I was in that ""Dystopian"" book phase (which I still am). Delirium is set in a Dystopian future where their society believes that love is a disease that people can be cured of at the age of 18. Lena has just a little over three months before she turns 18, but she falls in love. She meets a boy named Alex who woos her, they fall in love, and then it kind of has a twist at the end... one that makes you go... ""Wait! WHAT!?! WHY!?""  What I liked I really liked Lauren Oliver's style of writing. The plot never seemed choppy, it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter which is always a plus. The plot is kind of original and I say ""kind of"" because it is a Dystopian novel and these kinds of novels always have something outlawed, or forbidden. The forbidden thing in this novel would be the feeling of love. This means that you are matched with some one who you don't love, and you will never love. They will be your roommate who sleeps in the same bed with you. When you have kids you will only be watching and taking care of them out of duty, not out of love.  What I didn't like Nothing. I really, really liked this book.  How did I read this book I read this book on my nook, but it is one of those books that I want to have in paper form as well."

I have never had this happen before with other collars and would compare it burns left by a cattle prode. Even at a low setting, my dog yelped.

How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen.

The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting, was close to the theater, and had what seemed to be a good rate. What a huge mistake. The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. The room was not clean, the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving, they never bothered to come turn down the beds, and the late check-out 'priviledges' which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became 'upon request' - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful.

He is much smaller than I thought he would be, he looks cheap, his facial features are not placed in a way that looks normal, his head was not sewn correctly so it is crooked and smashed on one side. I kept him because my child specifically asked Santa for this character in a doll or stuffed version and I couldn't find another of any kind of this character.  My child loves him with all of his imperfections so it was not a waste of my money. The material and stitching are sturdy and he has held up very well with being handled and a constant companion to my child. I would not recommend this product unless you are in a similar situation to mine or unless the price of the product is less than four or five dollars."

There are three heat settings for cooking: Low, High, and Warm. I really like how the lid snaps and secures to the crockpot itself. The lid and and insert casserole bowl are dish washer safe and I have put both on the bottom rack. I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews. My husband and I both work 12hr days so having a crockpot meal or two a week is a life saver. I definitely recommend this crockpot if you love a good hot ready to eat meal when you walk through the door at the end of hard day."

1,I think the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a upscale place.I had my wedding there and it was the best of the best.The staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success. The chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts.They also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake.The tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect.The bar was also set up the way I wanted it and even had a champagne fountain. My guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered.The rooms were like suites with a mini bar.They had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom.

They hold up very well and will distract your chewer forever!

From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping, to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars, this hotel is one of the best in Chicago.

0,"These cups are huge and beautiful.  Unfortunately when I got my package, there was an ominous rattling in the box.  There is very little packing between the cups and apparently an impact had shattered one completely, shattered one's handle beyond repair and snapped another handle off which was able to be reattached with just a little gap missing. Only the blue cup survived.  Sadly, I really love the cup that survived, so I miss the ones that didn't make it.  The mugs are nice and big, perfect for serving desserts, soups or cereals out of.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality ceramic mug, but it is decent.  It seems homey and casual enough to use everyday, and survives the dishwasher fine.  I'm sure Amazon would replace any mugs destroyed in transit, but I with a little more care in packaging had been used to ensure that they would arrive intact.  Otherwise, they are beautiful."

0,"I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it. I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.  With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries. With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production) With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)  Pros: - PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these) - SIZE (fits in any bag) - WEIGHT -- Light weight - AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus - STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens) - COLOR -- Great color - SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!! - Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!  Cons - BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together) - STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens) - BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery) - RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.  Very annoying."

More ""Blade Runner""-style racial diversity than ""Blade Runner.""

0,"Purchased this for my adopted puppy. He was 10 months old, and over 90lbs when we got him. He came from a neglectful home, had never walked on a leash and was not trained at all. He pulls a lot on the leash, and is a jumper. A regular collar and leash was not cutting it. The only attention he got at home before was when he jumped up on his owners, which he did to us, then got him over excited and he began to mouth and nip. At almost 100lbs, this normal puppy behavior did a lot of damage. This product is well constructed, and good quality. It comes with an instructional DVD as well. However, I followed the DVD, and eased him into sizing and wearing this, gave him lots of love and treats during the whole process. He seemed fine with it and I tried having him wear it for a couple seconds at a time and went from there. He didn't seem to have a problem wearing it. However, when it came to actually using with a leash, my dog simply would not have it. He would struggle and/or flop to the floor and not move, and he always found a way out of the nose piece, even though it fit the way the video said it should. My dog is very stubborn and the most I could ever get him to walk on this was one lap around the living room. I wish this had worked for us, but it just wasn't a good fit for us. We bought the ""Easy Walk Dog Harness"" by the same brand at the same time, thinking we'd start with this one and work our way up to just the regular harness. It didn't work out that way, but the easy walk hardness was a much better fit. Don't give up too quickly if you have a difficult dog, or are an inexperienced dog owner like I am."

At first, my reservation could not be found, so I was provided a spare room. The hotel was fairly neat. However, once we got to the room, and onto the bed, we found the bed to be noisy. Just sitting on it made a squeaking noise that was unpleasant. We immediately called down to the front desk and informed them of our concern. We were told to go back downstairs to settle things out. Once we got downstairs, we were provided with another room number. However, we had to wait half an hour for another room to be cleaned and prepared. For such a well reviewed hotel, I was highly disappointed with the amount of time I had to spend to get settled into a room."

The glass hood fit perfect.  However the semi transparent plastic gap filler in the back is not deep enough to fully go to the back of the aquarium. I will be calling the manufacturer and see what is going on. I have an Aqueon 29 gallon tank so it's no mystery that this shouldn't be a good fit. Was hoping that was the case anyway.  20 years ago the fit was perfect. I think the glass size has changed. This must be fixed Aqueon."

Club groupies (there is a better word but Im not sure if it would fly with the Zon) are often portrayed as horrible women so the blurb of this book really drew me in and once started I really was hooked. Harmony was very down to earth, but also took no crap which I loved. Her place in the club was more for her than it was anything else, and she would not let anybody put her down when it came to choosing what she did. Kit came in on his bike and was this knight for her and I love how fast he fell for her. Add and lots of club drama, very steamy scenes, amazing secondary characters and I have to say that Im hooked on the series. I cant wait to dive into the next one."

The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.  The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.  I think I'd rather have a battery life of about a week and maybe a week and a half.  But it's still very good."

The character of the Chinese people and their complex culture comes through well in this part travel book and part musical memoir. It makes for a fascinating read and would most appeal to those who have picked up a guitar and, at some time, dreamed of being on stage.

0,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.  **UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**  This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.  Here are some professional reviews:  wccftech. com/review/sapphire-r9-fury-nitro-review/  pcworld. com/article/3037975/components-graphics/sapphire-nitro-r9-fury-graphics-card-review-fast-furious-and-ridiculously-quiet.html  kitguru. net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/sapphire-nitro-r9-fury-oc-4gb-review/  techpowerup. com/reviews/Sapphire/R9_Fury_Tri-X_OC/  hexus. net/tech/reviews/graphics/90086-sapphire-radeon-r9-fury-nitro/  hardwareasylum. com/reviews/video/sapphire_r9fury-nitro  eteknix. com/sapphire-nitro-oc-r9-fury-graphics-card-review/  **Remember to delete the space between the .com as Amazon does not allow direct links in reviews.  I hope this review helps - good luck!"

Recently stayed at the Ritz at Water Tower and the Dana around the corner--both of which were great but The James was perfect. Secured the room through a package w/ American Express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space, decor and location can't be beat. Staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the gym was substantial and though I didn't try the restaurants/room service, the menus looked yummy. I've stayed in Chgo in that area on avg 1-2s/mo over the past three years and the James is at the top my list now. If you can get a good deal, I highly recommend!!"

0,"Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece depicting yet another episodic take on the seemingly never-ending conflict between Good and Evil...  Combining a pristine and innocent imagination with the heart and soul of a poet, the young heroine Ofelia is seemingly over-matched against the consummate evil of Fascism that has possessed Franco's Spain.  Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.  Del Torro leaves it to the discretionary viewer to decide where fantasy ends and magical reality begins.  Within the magical fantastic occurrences between Ofelia and her fantasy/magical beings are contained lessons in life given to the all-too-human Ofelia.  They provide not only a means of escape but of real life survival, which strongly argues for more than the products of a young but gifted girl's prodigious imagination.  A great and timely movie that deserves all the attention it has received."

0,"LED lamps are everywhere and they just continue to improve. My favorite feature of this lamp is the true warm white color. Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.  The product description is a little strange - ""LED Incandescent"" - it's LED, not incandescent. It's also non-dimmable per the packaging."

The staff seemed miffed and stuck up, and I had to wait for the personal check in. I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited, and other guests (all single or couples without children) seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in. This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two, even though it is advertised as such. I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising, Amalfi."

I think the ending was better than the ending of the first film, and I would've loved to see it again. I was a little disappointed by the ending of the first film, because it was not as dramatic as the first film, but I would've liked to see the ending of the second film.

0,"The Darling is a magnificent book, far ranging and very compelling. Russell Banks, like Wally Lamb, writes authentically in the voice of a woman, so much so that it is hard to believe this book was really written by a man.  The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carrington, the darling of the title. What a misnomer! She is anything but darling. Selfish, self-absorbed and admittedly lacking any maternal instinct whatsoever, Hannah is not a sympathetic character, in spite of all she endures, nor even a very likeable one.  This is a story of a political radical's flight to W. Africa and her subsequent marriage to a black Liberian, which results in the births of three children. It is, of course, a tale of politics, race relations, and terrorism. But it is also a story of one woman's efforts to learn about herself and to make a life of value. Whether she ever succeeds at this goal is debatable.  This book made me want to immediately delve into anything written by Russell Banks!"
0,"**UPDATED AT THE END**  When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!  GENERAL First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!  EFFECTIVENESS We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!  WHY 5 STARS?? - Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product - Smells GREAT! - Contains no harmful chemicals!  OVERALL Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!  **UPDATE 03/2012** We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!"

0,"I love this series, one of the very few I will pre-order and autobuy. Jenna Bennett has a way of capturing my attention from the first page and holding it till the very last page. She blends humor, suspense, relationship  and mystery into storylines that keeps me coming back for more. I can't wait to see what happens next. But best of all is the relationship between Savannah and Rafe.  It's a Wow! This book takes place a month after the last one ends.  Savannah is now five months pregnant and it is the height of summertime in Nashville. She  learns former clients from a previous book are getting threatening letters when they advise her they may have to sell the house they love because of the threat.  Savannah begins to investigate, but the house's previous  owner is murdered before she can talk to him and then one of the current  homeowners is attacked in a home invasion. Can she solve the mystery behind the threat before it turns on her?"

0,"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.  This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".  But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.  But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.  On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".  And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.  Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller."

0,"Sample provided at discount or no cost for evaluation.  I don't know why, but my family has a lot of fun with masks and costumes, well past their typical use day and age suggestions. So I knew that we'd have fun with this one. I chose the pug because........... um, it's a pug?!? A pug face on a dog body is cute/funny enough. A pug face on a human body is hysterical.  This mask is rubber and fits a variety of head shapes and hair styles. It does have a funky smell as a lot of rubber masks do, but once it's aired out a bit, it's not even noticeable. The eye holes are actually near the snout, rather than the actual eyes, so it gives it a little more of a realistic look. The only thing I'd change is the mouth opening. If the person wearing it smiles and their teeth show it's super freaky. We're using this as a quick costume when needed, to make funny videos, to wear while riding the bike (why not - it really makes people look twice). Sometimes I wear it in the car (as a passenger, never while driving). Basically, doing anything you can think of that would look funnier if a person with a pug head was doing it.  It's a fun mask, good quality and would definitely fit a variety of sizes. See my photos for an idea of how it fits an adult woman and adult man. I'd actually like to get some of the other critters for variety."

0,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.  I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.  As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.  Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.  Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

0,This was my first time reading this author and I was not disappointed. She had great dialogue and chemistry between Jaro and Roslyn and managed to create a delightfully eccentric world for them to get to know one another in. There were plenty moments where I laughed out loud and while the suspense elements of Jaro's witness protection program were slightly unbelievable it definitely did not detract from the story. My one personal request would be for a little more steamy scenes between Jaro and Roslyn but the book definitely didn't feel like it was missing anything. I would for sure reccommend this book and you really can't beat the price.

When we got to our room, we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room. I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable. The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us. When we went to breakfast, we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived. For the price they were charging, the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere. It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car. For forty dollars a day for parking, we expected better."

It wasn't a bad price and selection if you want to get an bunch to start off with, just don't expect the big lush plants like you see in the pictures.

0,"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.  I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.  I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.  It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...  Please see my other review on Amazon of yoga and meditation dvds."

0,"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.  Pros: - Solid construction - Swings down for hatch access - Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint  Cons: - Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable - Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin  Other Thoughts: - Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze. - With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult. - I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order. - Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy. - A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with."

However, I found myself quite surprised at how enjoyable the book was to read.  The characterization seemed more real, and the plot did not get bogged down at all.  This book, and hopefully a series of books, will provide good adventure with a mix of Bible teaching.  No, they aren't going to be deep works of fiction, but still very enjoyable to read.  To me, it was like Indiana Jones, but with a Christian twist!"

I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his first time using this. He has been on it for about a month now and has started to get better. He is a very picky eater and his food is less full of junk and he does not like to eat anything else. It is not for a chewer. It is for the dog that is not a chewer.

By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare.

0,My 10 & 8 years olds love to play board and card games.  Which really frustrates my 4 year old b/c most games are too complex for him.  This is a great game that you can involve a preschool/kindergartener yet your 4th/5th grader will still enjoy.
0,"After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo, I decided to give this hotel a try. I must say it was a great choice! The location is perfect, just off from N Michigan Ave, walking distance from everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was excellent. They gave us a corner room w/a great view. As many have posted, the bed & pillows were very comfortable (I am very picky about that). I slept well every night! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. I highly recommend this hotel."

My room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen. I found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay. I will definitely book another stay at this hotel.
0,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:  1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.  2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.  3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.  4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.  5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?"

It was a breeze to do it.  I also found that the buttons were slightly difficult to use with the hand-held type switches.  If you have a hand-held switch, you will probably have to do it by hand, because it will feel very awkward.  I have tried other types of hand-held switches, but these are the first ones I have tried and I am very happy with the result.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are going to have a very tight grip on the levers and switches.

That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.  Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.  Highlights . . . ------------------------------------------------------------------ '' Heavy Duty Solid Die-cast Aluminum. '' Dual Bowl design, 1 for Lime, 1 for Lemon. '' Color coded for Lime & Lemon.  I have uploaded some Images and Video to Amazon that might not show up right away.

0,This product is all plastic with a fake leather like material pretty much glued on to the casing. My wife's ipad mini 2 retina would not fit this case. One side corner would snap in and the other wouldn't even push in. Past reviews say they fixed issues with the hinge. I do not agree. This product wasn't even worth the $30 I spent including shipping and the overall price is $99... It's plastic. Cheap plastic. Only reason I give a 3 star rating is because the seller responded quickly and because their shipping was so quick. My seller review would be considered a 5 star.
0,"I love the fact that the umbrella is so easy for a child to get open and shut (without risking pinching fingers).  There is literally a spring-loaded thing that they pull on to open and close, and no small metal parts to pinch.

1,"Do I really need to go back and watch the entire movie?  Well, I don't.  If you want to watch a movie that is worth watching, you won't be disappointed.  The movie starts off fairly simple:  the protagonist, who has been given a job by a woman who is a failed singer, is recruited to work with a female singer who is a successful musician who has been given a job by a man who is an alcoholic.  The woman is shown to be a young woman who is trying to get a job and she is not able to find a job.  As the story goes, the woman has a dream.  It is a dream that she has and she does not understand.  When she sees the dream she realizes she is a failed singer and she is not the only singer in the world who is a failure.  This is what she wants and the dream is the only thing that she can do to get a job.  She has a lot of good qualities, but her dreams are not true.  The movie is very well done, with some very good performances by the women and some very bad ones.  The story is very well told and the acting is good.  The movie is also a good movie and the movie is a good one.  The ending is a little long, but you will enjoy it.  It is a very good movie.  The movie is very good and the movie is a good one.

The material is soft and the cups are comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone.I love these.  They are so comfortable and I can wear them all day with a little bit of extra weight.  I wear them to work all the time and they are a perfect size for me.  I have a hard time finding good nursing bras that fit me correctly.  They are a perfect size for me and I like that they do not fall out when I do not wear them for a long time.  I wear a size 10 and they fit perfectly.  I like the fact that they are a little longer than the ones I have tried on and I do not have to worry about the bra falling out after I have washed them.  They are comfortable, lightweight, and I am very happy with them.  I am planning on wearing them for a few more weeks and I am very happy with them.  I am very satisfied with the purchase.Very nice and very comfortable for all my daily wear.  I was worried that the material would stretch a little, but it is very soft.

I will probably just hang the holes up on the frame so I don't have to worry about them falling off. I'm really happy with this purchase. I love that they are made of solid wood.

Will Alice be able to trust Calvin only has her best interest at heart?  I have read a few of Gray's books and loved each novel because each one had a surprise element. However, I felt like this novel fell short and lacked excitement. The person who causing all of the trouble was very obvious even though there were two people of interest.

The handle seems sturdier than others coupled with being a little longer.  The wheels are fine, I didn't want a ""spinner"" briefcase, but I was willing to let that go because of its other assets.  It seems some people have many more problems with wheels on luggage than I, so I must not test their durability enough to proclaim these ""sturdy"". They seem fine.  The quality of the outside material is a heavy nylon type, not something that would rip easily.  The laptop protector incorporated in the case is easily adjustable and accomodates my Dell E6510(17"") easily. One thing I wanted was a unit that would fit under a 737 seat so I can bring another carryon for the overhead if neccesary. Done."

0,"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun. I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath."

Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.  The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.  Overall, a recommended read."

1,"I've read nearly all ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" books. This one is a pretty good read.I had to read this book to get through the first half of it. The story was well told and the characters were interesting. I wish I had read it to get through the second half. I liked the characters and I enjoyed the interaction between them. I wish I had read it to get through the third half. I'm not sure I'd have liked it so much if it had been longer. I'd be glad I did, since I liked the first half.I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next one.  This book is a must read for any historical book lover.  I would recommend it for those who enjoy historical fiction and history.If you are a fan of the YA genre, this is a great book.  You will enjoy reading it.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not too long and full of good characters.

1,"Fantastic stay! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. They are the best I've ever had. EVER! If youre in the mood to unwind, you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. I had a great time here. From now on, I won't stay anyplace else."
0,"In cycling, White is the new Black right now. White bikes, white saddles, white stems, and even white handlebars covered in (and completely obscured by) white tape. My new mountain bike - designed to spend most of its life in the dirt - is painted white. Obviously there are problems with this trend. Within 6 months of getting my road bike, the white tape it came with was starting to yellow and deteriorate. I had seen a positive review online of the DSP bar tape and a local shop also recommended it as well, so I decided to give it a try.  I have only been using the tape for two months, but at this point I couldn't be happier with the product. In fact, I just ordered more to put on my cyclocross bike. The extra thickness of the DSP tape helps make rough roads more pleasant. Also, the synthetic material remains easy to grip even with damp or sweaty gloves. I can't tell much about durability at this point, but I suspect the extra thickness will lead to a longer life for this bar tape as well.  Also, for those of you that are into the trend of everything white, I am told by the bike shop that the synthetic material in the DSP tape stays white longer than most of the other stuff on the market."
0,This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.  These last so much longer than any other ball I have bought for my rough player.
1,I had a fantastic time! Will come again!
1,Very comfortable especially in the sun. The only problem is that it's a little too large and doesn't fit well. The front part is also too narrow and tight. The material is nice and soft and it's not stiff like a lot of other brands I've tried.
0,"First let me say I must have a real one because it is great! Does everything I wanted it to do, better than I expected. Extremely good clear picture. No complaints at all except of course the manual is quite useless, but the menu is reasonably intuitive so just go with it. I like it so much after seeing what is does I went back on Amazon to get one for my truck, to my dismay the same item had jumped $20 or 50% in price. Sorry, I like it but not enough to pay 50% more a few days later. So searching around on Amazon I found a Foneso Dashboard blackbox that looked identical in the picture except it is blue on the front side. Specs all looked the same and it was slightly less $ and Amazon being wonderful like they are I decided to try it. Virtually the same thing slightly different menu and symbols, but every bit as good as this one. The choice is yours, just be sure to buy from Amazon so if you get a bad one or a fake as some have said they got you can return it"

0,"Great lead performances by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton highlight this film along with great supporting performances by Maureen Stapleton and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill.  Beatty plays journalist John Reed, a journalist very passionate about his views and was witness to the Russian Revolution in the 1910's. The movie provides insights into his idealistic views along with his romantic relationship with Louise Bryant (Keaton) whom he had a very passionate but also quite stormy relationship.  Jack nearly steals the show as O'Neill, a man very much in love with Bryant despite the fact that her heart really belongs to Reed.  And Stapleton won a well deserved Oscar as Emma Goldman, a woman who shared a lot of the same views as Reed, and initially had no use for Bryant until much later.  It's a political movie but it's also a love story and it works well with both. Definitely a must-see."

0,"A disappointment to say the least. I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out! I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night. The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card, since they do indeed take American Express. I couldn't wait to get there! We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3:00 on Saturday afternoon. Me, the tourist, I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding. We get in the line to check in. I give them the gift card and my check card. They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate, but for incidentals as well. We give them a credit card instead. While in line checking in, we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like. The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man. Someone's luggage has been lost. He desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see. Not impressed. We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see. The rooms on the website looked glorious! My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room. The sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room. Yuck. We stay the night and go to check out in the morning. Again, I give them the American Express gift card. The clerk says 'their system usually doesn't take them'. I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday. He swipes the card and bam! it works! What do you know?? He was so rude. I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. Such a disappointment!"

0,"Three nights there on business. Hadn't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement, very bleak. Told the front desk that I hadn't realized about the construction, so I'd have to switch hotels, they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights. So I stayed. TV didn't work. Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me...eventually after I called again, a few hours later, a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it. Long and complicated experience at the business center (which doesn't open until 9am, BTW), where I ended up paying $45 to print 55 pages. Had to buy these cards, and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway, (and charging me for them). I was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago, 2000 miles from where I live. I asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that. Nice room, nice view, but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad. Worst experience I've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business."

0,"This book was a recommendation of my reading group. Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.  I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight. The writing was good, there was NO foul language or explicit scenes. I would classify this book as a ""cozy."" And while it was good and well-written, it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, unable to put it down, so I give it four stars."

(If you happen to lose the box all of the instructions are located on their website)  I love that all the pieces come in a reusable pouch, not those plastic bags that get thrown away.  I love that all of the materials are all recycled but all have a very high quality feel.  Most of all, I love the sheer genius that is a cooperative game.  Sure, it is important for kids to know what it feels like to win and to lose, and we still play games like Monopoly Junior where there is a clear winner but when there is too much ""I WIN I WIN"" going on in the house I pull out Peaceable Kingdom's Race to the Treasure or Hoot Owl Hoot.  Cooperative games require all players to work together as a team to win.  At first I thought there was no way my 5 year old would fall for this, he is competitive and loves to chant ""I WIN I WIN"".  Much to my surprise, he loves all of the Peaceable Kingdom games we have played.  My 5 year old son loves to help his 3 year old brother because it ultimately helps them both ""win"" the game.  And two winners is always better than one, right?  Race to the Treasure is my favorite Peaceable Kingdom game.  The goal is to create a path to pick up three keys and get to the finish before the ogre gets you.  The game requires some thinking and strategy of how you'll pick up the keys and get to the finish but most importantly, it requires the players to work together to decide which path is the best way.  It's pretty amazing to see kids working together for a common goal rather than plotting against one another for the glory."

1,"Since this was our first visit to the 'windy city,' we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. We read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go. The 'go' ended up being a 'no go.' We were sorely disappointed. When we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. We have two kids with us, so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. We were told 'no problem.' Unfortunately, it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. Then, we noticed a bug (or bugs) near the fridge area. Yikes! We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room (or floor!). Our request was met about 30 minutes later. By this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. Customer service was so lacking! We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price!

I enjoyed the book, but it was not one of my favorites.  I was sent a free print copy of the book by NightOwlReviews.com in return for my honest opinion of the book.

0,"a great hotel, we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great, that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel. So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9$ and we used the buses alot (freezing cold). The hotel itself is great, very clean rooms, realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had. Staff very friendly, they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes.... and she was right i got them in one place she told me... thats service...I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area, did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price....but realy a nice view makes running easyer...."

I also liked the ending.  I felt like there was more depth to the story.  I'm not going to say too much because the story is too short, but I feel that the writing was a"

1,"My wife and I booked a Deluxe Accessible Room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. The wonderful photos don't do the hotel justice. It couldn't have been a more ideal stay. The room was spacious and and clean, the bathroom sparkling, with every amenity one could imagine. The bed felt like it had been just delivered. Our views of downtown Chicago were spectacular. On top of all of this, the hotel staff was extremely helpful. They explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at, and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy! Believe everything good that you read. If you visit Chicago, stay at the Conrad Chicago."

0,"I am in awe of this series, I cannot get enough of this story.  There was so much going on in this installment, I again was so elated that I waited for all the books to be out so no waiting for the next one. Each cliffhanger in the series is bigger than the last.  Jase knows who ""Sammi"" is now. How did he find out ? Will he tell Dornan? Is he truly still the boy that Juliette loved, still loves? Is he on her side?  It was like I was holding my breath with Juliette waiting for Jase to figure it out. Then he does and I felt relief and then much like Juliette I felt despair at the consequences now that Jase knows. What a roller coaster ride of emotions!  Lili St. Germain knows how to tell a gripping story that's for sure.  Moved right on to the next book."

Overall, I would rate Fairmont Chicago a 10/10!"

1,"I purchased this Griddle to replace a Teflon Grill Teflon that I had been using for a year.  The grill is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this grill to heat up the Keurig, and it worked great.  I used it for the first time to cook with a single scoop of nonstick chicken broth, and the nonstick chicken made a very flavorful, flavorful chicken broth.  The nonstick chicken broth was perfect, and I don't have to worry about the chicken being cooked too hot, since I don't need to worry about it being cooked too cold.  This grill is perfect for the heat I need to heat up the steak, as well as to cook the other meats.  I can also use it for the other meats, such as chicken, beef, pork, and chicken breast.  I like that the nonstick chicken broth is thicker and easier to clean, as well as that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean and clean with the other nonstick chicken.  I like that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean with the other nonstick chicken, and that the nonstick chicken is easier to clean with the other nonstick chicken.

0,"So there is a reason this food is a #1 best seller in dry dog food. It's not just because of the price for the size bag but it's the taste and scent the dogs go crazy for. Diamond pet foods had one bad recall a few gets back and everyone wants to judge them based on that. Doesn't just about everything everywhere get a recall at some point in its life span?

1,So I've been reading this book for the last two years and it's always a pleasure to read. I had a friend who was a social worker and she had a lot of fun reading this book. It was a very interesting story about the lives of people living in the south. It was a great read. I read it several times over the course of a month and it made me want to get back to it. I'm looking forward to getting back to it. I have read all of her books and the series has been really good. I was actually not sure if this was a good book but it definitely was. I read this book first to get the idea of the book and now to get to the actual content. I can tell you I was a little worried that this book would be the last book in the series but I was glad I didn't. It was really well written and really kept you guessing as to who was who. I really enjoyed the interaction between the main characters and their personalities. I loved the idea that they were so different that it was possible for them to be very different and that I would like them to be together. I was really hoping that the story would have been longer and I think that is the case and I am glad that I did. I was also hoping that there would be more depth to the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm happy I read it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed this book. It is a very good read and I have read the entire series.

0,"Too small. Using the measuring chart, the sizing is incorrect. Consider next size up.  Good luck, I will update comment after reordering the next larger size.  I reordered the sun visors in size small and they are a much better fit .  I Do not know if the bill on the visor is long enough to really shade the shih tzu eyes but will know better during actual outside wear.  The velcro strap may be an issue as well.  It is a little awkward to put in place and tends to get tangled with the ear and face.  They are cute though.  We will have to see how really functional they are."

Works great.  If they don't like it, I put some on top of their paw and rub it in so they have no choice but to lick it off."
0,"This is the first Furby we've had in our house. I was determined not to get caught up in the melee of getting one. But I stumbled across on at Costco at a great price so I picked it up for my 9 year-old daughter for Christmas. We have had a lot of fun with it even though it can get pretty obnoxious at times! It is funny how it progresses and it can change personality. But if you are aware of that feature, it makes it okay, especially if you know how to control the personalities.  This one is a nice set of blues and the amount of animation and movement is impressive for robotic toy in the price range that I paid ($30). So we will have fun with it and since it 'evolves' it will hopefully last longer than some other toys that disappear in a week.  As an adult, I'm fascinated to wake it up at times and see what it says. As long as I know how to turn it off when I'm tired of hearing the barrage of speech... then we are all good. My daughter has had fun as well."

I believe completely the reviews claiming defective disks. Performance may vary based on specific bluray players. Why take a chance? And, although I have purchased many items from Amazon with high satisfaction, please be keenly aware that you have a scant 30 days after delivery to return defective goods. I dare say most unfair in regard to series of DVD's and Blurays. Totally unrealistic to view a set in 30 days. I'm stuck with this defective product.

In fact, I was reading another book but stopped to read this one when an email alerted me that it was now available for purchase.  She did not disappoint.  Don't let the fact that it is a YA book deter you.  It is still a wonderful story that kept me engaged.  I read it in less than 24 hours.  I really enjoyed Jessie's story and her coming to terms with her mother's death and finding out her biological father is a rock star.  I'll never be in that exact situation but it was fun and full of drama but still realistic and down to earth if that makes sense.  It was easy to relate to Jessie.  It was also fun catching up with Meg and Johnny.  I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars because I do feel that some of situations in the book were a bit mature for younger audiences.  There is drinking, and smoking.  *spoiler alert* The characters don't go further than kissing but I feel that some terms used were a bit mature.  That's probably just me though.  Overall, wonderful story I know I will probably reread."

0,"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe.. The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do. This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods."

0,"This is a book about a young man with a dark past and a young woman with a future on which she placed all of her faith. Lucas hadn't known Jacqueline, but he had watched her from a distance. Jacqueline didn't even know that Lucas truly existed until one night he saved her from a horrible incident. Now it seems as if she keeps running into him. Jacqueline can't get him out of her head. Lucas is the ""bad boy"" with the tattoos to go along with that stereotype. He is sexy in every way. He's good looking, has tattoos, is mysterious, and knows how to teach a girl how to defend herself. Jacqueline can't seem to keep herself away from the mystery of him. This book is full of angst and passion, and takes you through the journey of falling in love and lust.  I fell in love with this book! I enjoyed the mystery that surrounded Lucas and the love/lust that Lucas and Jacqueline shared. This was a book that was written to emulate real life, which was a nice break from all the fantasy I have been reading. I thought this book was going to just be a love/lust book with not much else going on, but there was an adventure presented by the incidents that happened as well as deception. I was entertained through the whole length. I found out that there will be a second book, Breakable, being released May 6, 2014. You better believe that I have already pre-ordered it! I rated this book 5/5 stars and highly recommend it."

Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. Wireless internet is available, but that's an additional fee. Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free! Also, the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. Wow, I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. When I used the coffee supplies in the room, they were not replenished. I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. No kidding, nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar! Glad I wasn't in a big hurry. I'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I'm in Chicago!"

It's a little thin on him, but he doesn't seem to mind it at all. He's a bit heavier, but he's still able to roll around and jump up and down. This harness has held up pretty well. It's easy to clean, and he doesn't have to worry about getting the harness tangled up in his chest. It's not a big deal, but it's a nice extra-large size for him. I have two dogs. They both love this toy and it's a huge hit."

The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. Tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place!"

0,"Unfortunately, this movie is not very good.  Such an epic moment in time truly deserves a good movie, and I was suckered into watching this on the grounds that I may have stumbled upon one.  Well, there was a reason why I'd never heard of this movie, that reason being: because this movie is really bad at being a movie.  It's EXTREMELY hackneyed and cliched, and doesn't make that okay by being fun to watch.  It's not bad because it's an anti-war movie or for any political reasons, it's bad because it's boring and poorly put together as a film.  Maybe someday they'll make a good movie about The Battle of the Somme, but as of 2016, that day hasn't come."
0,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed. The plot really had a lot of potential, the story would have been better had it focused on the plot and kept the romance clean and simple. Less is usually more."

0,"Above in the ""product discription""(Editorial Reviews) they have (on their long review) ""The Heart is the Lonely Hunter"" where is that in this box set. They also forget the discription for ""Brother Orchid"". ??  It is between ""Lady Killer"" and ""Smart Money""  as follows. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter stars Alan Arkin as John Singer, who is deaf. Singer moves from a small town in order to be close to his institutionalized deaf and mentally impaired friend Antonapoulos (Chuck McCann). Singer rents a room with a family whose father, Mr. Kelly (Biff McGuire), is unable to earn a living due to a serious injury. His teen-aged daughter Mick (Sondra Locke, in her film debut) is at first resentful of Singer's presence, but he ingratiates himself by introducing her to classical music (which he can ""feel,"" if not hear). Singer likewise tries to brighten the lives of such unfortunates as alcoholic Blount (Stacy Keach Jr. , also making his first film appearance), dying black doctor Copeland (Percy Rodriguez), and Copeland's poverty-stricken daughter (Cicely Tyson). ?????????? If you don't see it they removed it. But as of 27 Jan 08 the above was there."

0,"This is still the best biographical introduction to the poet Emily Dickinson but it was written in the l970s and tends to include only  material denigrating Susan Dickinson from bystanders from that era. Since Sewall's book, more information about the relationship between Emily and Susan has been uncovered and sheds new light on the subject. In addition, Sewall leaned heavily on material provided by Mabel Loomis Todd about Susan that is - shall we say - one-sided. The book is particularly strong on Emily Dickinson's forbears, family and early years and for this and more I highly recommend it. The chapters on Otis Lord and Samuel Bowles are particularly revealing."

I'm sure other more expensive knives are better but for someone that isn't hardcore, this is a perfect knife (thus far), It's sharp, opens smoothly, feels solid, and not expensive. I can see this leading me to get others, but for now, this is a great starter knife."

0,"Have now tried this product on 5 different cats.  Two gobbled them down with tablet inside.  One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all day - IT worked.  One cat sniffed and ran regardless of what I tried.  CATS ... what can you say other than that?  At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!  Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).  Think I may try the salmon flavor on other cat, can't hurt to try, if she doesn't like, the other cats may and at ~$6.00 no big investment."

1,I had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad. When we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king. This was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment. We were offered a free dinner which we accepted. The restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good. The tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair. This took about an hour to resolve. Overall we would not pick this hotel again. They should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition. We feel it was not a good value.

1,"I was very disappointed with this hotel. I have stayed in other Swissotels and enjoyed them very much, but the service can only be described as aloof. There was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure, and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information I had given her minutes ago. Precise, indeed. Room service took forever to pick up (good sign in a way=busy because they are good), but the food arrived very late and very cold. The man tried to replace it, but than took another hour, and I was never given a price reduction, free dessert, or anything to apologize. As for cleanliness, they must be next to godly, as they knocked on my door at 0800, despite the fact I had a doorknocker requesting no service (I'm a late sleeper.) Very disappointed with my stay. This hotel clearly did not help build the chain's reputation."

0,"Before booking this hotel, I did read the reviews, and I was concerned. I ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation. BIG MISTAKE!! The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees, and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees. When we called to complain at 11:00 am, they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees. We went back at 7:30pm. it was still humid, the beds were moist & the room very stuffy. Called again, they sent somone to fix it, & he recommended getting a new room, because the room will not cool down. They told us they were booked, yet, after the maintenance man called, they suddenly had a room available, go figure? So they move us to another room, guess what, it is 85 degrees. Again, they told us to turn it down to 40, needless to say, it never cooled down & we should have just slept on the street. We travel a lot, and we stayed here one night, and it was awful!!. At check out, I had to re-tell our entire room issue, they actually ended up not charging us for the night, thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay, because we would never go back. Also, the room decor is very old and stuffy. If your going to Chicago, don't stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker!!"

1,"So, I never even got a chance to test it. I will say that my cats are pretty picky about their food and I am not going to waste any money on a food that is not 100% safe.  If you're thinking about going with this food, you should definitely read the reviews.  Also, I'm not sure if it is a product of the cats or just their natural diet. Maybe the cat is on a diet with a protein, so if that's your cat's diet, I would definitely recommend it.  I also recommend this food to my friends, and especially my friends that are older cats. I can't say enough about how they love this food. I got a huge ""thank you"" for the food and I am so thankful for that.I love this product.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not on any of these.

0,"First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.  These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?). Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.  Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.  Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch  I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.  I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!  As such, I cannot recommend these"

1,"The Omni Chicago Hotel was a delight to stay in. The second you step into the place, it takes your breath away. It's very modern with an antique twist. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. They are clean. Every member of the staff was courteous and polite. Proud of their place of work. Happy to be there. You don't often see that. The room service was phenomenal. Visiting Chicago was amazing, and staying at the Omni Hotel made my visit that much better. The luxurious pools were an added plus as well. I also enjoyed the gym facilities. I will definitely be staying at the Omni Hotel on my next visit."
0,"I'm not one of those fortunate people that have a lot of garage space and a big truck to haul a ladder around in so this works perfectly. It feels flimsy but works well. I can now get into my teeny tiny indoor attic opening. Dropped one star because it feels flimsy, although I've had no problems with it holding my weight. Dropped another star because of the danger factor. Be very careful when lowering this ladder. Keep your hands under the switches or a trip to the hospital for a smashed finger/hand may be in order."

1,My granddaughter loves this kit. We have had it for a few months now and it's been a great addition to our family's house. We also have the Tamiya version of the game that we play. It's a good value for the money. This was a gift for my niece. She loves it!  I did get a free item and it is a great gift. We love this set. It's a great size. I like that the pieces are interchangeable. It is also very easy to assemble. I love that it comes with two small pieces that you can attach to the sides of the ship. We've put it together over a year and it still looks great. I also like that the pieces are easy to put together. My son was able to cut down the number of pieces by removing the pieces. It's a great addition to any Lego set. Our toddler loves this game. It is cute and easy for him to play. The game is good for older kids who like to play with older kids. The story is well-made and the characters are well-made. The cards are well-written and well-coloured. The game is easy enough for a 4-6 year old to play. The game is a fun game for a group of friends who like to play with their friends. This is an excellent game for a family game night.

The only thing I have a problem with is that they are just a tad too wide for some cabinets, and I couldn't find any a little narrower. If would be great if InterDesign would make a more narrow storage bin that's the same length and depth."

Most people who have seen the orginal and enjoyed it shouldn't even try to watch a re-make, not just for this film but any because no matter how good it was they'll hate it. I have to say I enjoyed all the re-makes so far. ""The Grudge""; ""One Missed Call"" and so on and so forth. I also like these because I haven't seen the org: The movie is worth watching."

The room was large, clean and had a couch, easy chair and desk chair. The bedding was the newer 'non-bedspread' style, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large and, well, we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way. We ate at the lobby restaurant, which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there. We only got Cobb Salads, so I don't know if the food, in general, is good or not. The Cobb was so-so. Our only complaint was the $48 fee to park your car over-night and the $13 daily fee for the internet. Many places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept. We hated to leave!"

0,"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.  With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door,  it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.  The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parents  I served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.  The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."

0,"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about Saba and her journey to recover her twin brother, Lugh, after he is kidnapped from their home at Silverlake.  Saba is very close with her twin brother and puts him on a pedestal...he is the light to her dark.  When the reader first encounters Lugh, he is a father-like figure, taking care of the day-to-day needs of Saba, their father, and their younger sister, Emmi.  Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.  Along the way, she also meets Jack and a gang of revolutionary girls called the Free Hawks.  We watch how she grows as a person and learns the importance of family and friends.  I highly recommend."

0,"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.  All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.  I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.  Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.  UPDATE *just found out the LED is powered by a SATA cable.

0,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.  B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.  Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.  A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.  Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.  Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.  There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond."

1,"Oh my goodness, this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago. It all went well enough checking in, but them went downhill. There was so much left to be desired. The biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet, I kid you not! I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it, I just don't know. But for the prices they charge, this type of thing is unacceptable. Most everything else about the actual room was as expected. The noise was a bit more than I'm used to though, but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us. So we asked to be moved to another room, they did get us in another room, but that took nearly 2 hours. The second room worked out well for us, but I won't be risking staying here again. Plus the pool was not available, I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website, I was looking forward to it for days.

0,"Should have watched the video posted with the still pics for this toy.  In the pics, especially where the boy is kneeling, there is no background.  Because of this you can't tell that the toy MUST be attached to a wall to work.  See those yellow brackets (one is mid-circle on the right)?  The set comes with sticky pads that go on the backs of these yellow brackets, to attach them to the wall.  My son doesn't have enough open wall space in his room to use this.  Had to send it back.  But, I'm GLAD there was not enough wall space.  After watching the videos, the power boost, or whatever it's called, just makes the car go around and around.  NO interaction by the kids playing!  They just sit there and watch.  Check out one reviewers video for a quick experience of this toy.  The car goes around so fast you can't even see it!  Not the kind of Hot Wheel experience I want for my son.  Also, one reviewer said it was difficult to set up.  Not sure you'd WANT to break it down due when the child is done playing with it due to the difficulty factor AND due to the fact that it's stuck to the wall.  I prefer toys that you can put away after the child is done using it."

0,"""The Terminator"" directed by the brilliant James Cameron, is the most thought-provoking motion picture of the 1980's. What if computers controlled the world? Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie. Good thing Hollywood made the best sequel to have ever hit the big screen to explain themselves."

This is easy to read, and it hangs off the oven rack so it doesn't get in the way.  I have Prime, so it arrived quickly.  When I purchased this it was even less expensive than comparable thermometers at my local store.  I like this one because the dial is larger and easier to see.  After several months it is still running strong.  I hope my review has been helpful for you."
0,Ever need to use your computer and not sit in front of it?  I do all the time.  I use my computer to learn the guitar so having to scoot over to my computer just to hit a space bar or some-such is a pain in the behind.  I thought this would be something to try and see if it helped.  It sure has.  Being able to use my mouse from across the room is a godsend. Once i got used to the motions of it it was second nature to click on whatever I needed. Really useful for me.  If I was in an office setting where I had to give frequent presentations this would be great.  Really nice product. I was really impressed with how well it worked. The only wish I had with this product was to have a little more documentation.  The only help info is on the box and that doesn't cover much.  I was able to figure it out but it would be nice to have a bit more. I did get a disocunt on this product but that did not affect my view on it.  I really think this is a nice air mouse.
0,"We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels' website newsletter. Affinia has a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower. Beware however: parking is expensive in the Gold Coast....$48/night. Right from the start, Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome. Check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous. However, it was a handicapped acessible room and I wanted a tub, so one call to the front desk and we had another room. All rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful, comfortable and well appointed. The rooftop bar is a must-do. The outside patio has heaters and candles, a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views. We didn't sit inside the bar area. Pedro and Quentin were excellent bellmen, and Christopher (concierge) was very helpful. As we left, we shook Victor's hand (he's always there!) and told him we've found our new Chicago hotel!"
0,These weights work just fine but Amazon shows a picture of a different more expensive set than what they send to you. They have a picture of a set of weights in a red plastic box that has 5 weights sitting in the foam rubber beside of the plastic box of smaller weights. What they sent was just the small box of weights. I could have bought this set of weights at Midwayusa.com and saved over $6. This is not the first time this has happened.

0,"We adopted my our Boston Terrier puppy at almost 9 months old and she came to us having ""not been trained"" which meant that she had trained herself to, among other things, pull pull pull on her leash. Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey! There's something over there I want to smell! [yank] Oh, right..."" Small dogs, large dogs, this is what you want!"

Book 3 was a kind of journey to self discovery for the characters both individually and together as a couple. Both Sloan and Lexi began therapy and they started to move on with life.

0,"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.  But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.  This is a 5 star item now that I've ""fixed"" it, but as it was, because it's so very easy to lose, 3 stars."

I sure was not disappointed by my decision! This hotel lots of historic charm. Despite being a larger hotel, the service was top shelf! The rooms, while not large by any means, were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable. My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered. As for me, I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile. The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site. The food was very good and, just like the hotel itself, the restaurant provided perfect customer service. Dollar for dollar, the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again."

0,"I am 5'4"", 185 - 190Lbs, 38DDD bust, so I ordered this in a size 3X. I wanted so very badly to love this swimsuit. I saw it on one of the other reviewers and she rocked it. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. It is sadly just not suited for my body. On me - it lets all of the wrong things hang out (I'll upload a photo to show what I mean). Fit wise, for the most part it did fit me as it should, even the breast area provided appropriate coverage. I just was not at all comfortable in this suit. I still gave it 3 stars because the return process was fast and easy. I won't say that there is anything wrong with this suit because as I stated the other reviewer looks fantastic in it and she says she feels great in it. Guess it's just not for everyone!!"

After 6 months or so, the motion detector sometimes did not turn on the lights and I had to walk through the dark kitchen to tap on the sensor to make it work.  Now the sensor never works and this is simply a manual switch.  I emailed Enerlite and their customer service rep said ""We don't usually get involved with our retailer's customers"", and told me to seek help from Amazon.  But of course it's been a year, so I guess that's all the help I am going to get.  The price is low, but not low enough to warrant buying another one year light switch, so goodbye Enerlite.  It's a shame because I really loved this switch in the beginning."
0,"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).   Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?   Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).   One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports. Came with 2 5ft. Ethernet cables.  BTW, sound fading problem has disappeared, thanks to this great product!"

One of them is disdainful towards any kind of scratching post -- but the other has ripped through several of the inexpensive $9 throw-away boxes. In fact there are at least two or three of them spread through the house, not counting the little crunchies left behind from enthusiastic scratching.  When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.  Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.  Fortunately as other reviewers have reported, it's constructed very well, with the cardboard FAR more dense than in the cheap scratching boxes you're thinking of. I won't need to replace this for a good long time."

The hero and heroine in the book, Ronan, and Kara are developed and work real well together.  Kara's mother was married to Ronan's dad until she found out just he did for a living then she left and divorced him.  I loved how Ronan is trying to help Kara and yet has to fight to keep his feelings for his step sister to come out.  The way that the characters of Ronan and Kara are developed your taken on a ride that you will never forget.  Ronan wants Kara but he wants to be the head of his father's mob family one day, or so he thinks.  Kara is in serious trouble and the only person that can help her is her muscled, tattooed, handsome but evil step brother, Ronan.  Kara and Ronan both want each other, but can they stay away from each other?  Can Ronan protect her and yet do his job with the family? I recommend this book to any body who wants to live the life of a lover to a gorgeous, cocky, Mobster!  I promise you will not be disappointed.  No spoilers given.  An ARC free book for an honest review."

It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?  We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all.

0,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.  I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""  Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities.

It's not ground-breaking; if you've read McCullough's _John Adams_, or Ellis's own _Passionate Sage_, you'll find most of this information familiar. However, Ellis's approach is a good one: this is a biography not of John, nor of Abigail, but of John-And-Abigail. There's a lot of good, well-researched character development, and a nicely nuanced view of this ever-evolving relationship.

0,"My best friend Kate, has taken anti-depressants for many years. She has seen doctor after doctor to try and find out why she needs this medication. In reading this book I learned more about helping her than in many years past. Since it was doctor diagnosed, it should be doctor fixed. Made sense to me. This wonderful book teaches you different. Kate and I have begun to put to the test a few of the methods described in How To Be Happy. They have produced laughter and activity we were missing out on just a few days ago. Sadly no doctor ever told her that laughter acts as a tranquilizer and a mood enhancer. I wish I would have know how to help my best friend years ago. It has been a wonderful experience to see her come out of that deep dark place she has been in, even on medication, for so long. This book has changed both our lives for the better and I could not be happier. Dont think you have to have a sad friend to benefit from this book. You are given ways of making a happy life even happier. You are inspired by the confidence that is instilled into you to know you can help others with just a simple smile, even if you are not aware of it!"

Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in, we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention, she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault. Needless to say I will not be staying here again."

0,"This book was like a breath of fresh air after decades of being immersed in the increasingly bizarre Niagara of conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination.  Posner did what no one thought possible, he drained a swamp.  Sticking to meticulous verifiable fact and going back to first sources Posner asserts that the truth was there all along.  His reading style is easy, moving along and building up the facts bit by bit.  What Posner shows is that these theories often collapse under the weight of their own Byzantine thinking.  I still reread it occasionally just to enjoy a careful mind making a logical case out of a morass of nonsense."

1,"When I was younger, I saw this and thought it was pretty cool. My 2 year old has a lot of fun with it. The only negative is the plastic is a bit loose and that's a good thing. It's a little hard to balance it with the other two toys. I think it's a good toy to keep them engaged and to have on hand for play.I bought this for my son to use as a teaching toy.  He likes it, and so does my son.  He is now learning about the alphabet, letters, and numbers, and is enjoying playing with it.  It is easy enough for him to grasp and put together, but hard for him to put down and take it out of the box.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the show.  My son is almost 3 and loves to play with it.  It is very well made and really fun.  I would recommend this to anyone with a child who loves teaching letters and numbers.This is a great way to teach kids to be creative and creative.

1,"""When Genius Failed"" reads like a novel, with the third act of the book being the first one. I had to read the book to get through the third act of the book. The plot is in good shape, and it's as if the author wrote it for the fans. The writing is wonderful, and the characters are well developed. I will say that I had to read the book to understand the plot. This book is better than the first book, but I'd be willing to give it a shot."

0,"I didn't like this book and I didn't like Sally Mann.  It was the most boring book I have read in a long time.  First of all, she really puts a great emphases on how smart she supposedly is.  She includes notes from elementary, high school and college teachers.  Pardon me while I yawn.    This book is interspersed with photos, copies of notes and letters, and anything Mann throws in to make herself look good.  Her notoriety comes from the nude photos she took of her children growing up.  Many people found them sexually suggestive.  I found them exploitive but not really offensive.  Mann spends time defending herself on the photos calling herself nave time and time again.  That's OK for awhile but it gets tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all.  She is shocked that pedophiles are interested in them. Really?    She also separates the pictures from the children.  She says the children are merely actors in the pictures and can keep the two separate identities apart even the 6 year old. Then she goes on to say how nice it is to have pictures of their childhood.  Which is it?  Are they separate or true depictions?    After that she goes on to explore past relations.  She discusses her husband's parents murder/suicide.  Then she goes on to discuss kinfolk in even the more distant past.  This is when I lost complete interest and just thumbed through the rest of the book's pictures.  By then I was so turned off that I didn't even enjoy them.    This was definitely not the book for me."

I like that the end of the ring is straight and that it's not hard.  I like that it has a ""stiff"" edge.  I like that the end is flat,"

0,"I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.  On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.  Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.  I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand."

0,"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.  bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.  as they say in the brew community, ""Cheers!"""
0,"Purchased this for Christmas for our son for Boy Scouts. Hauled it out today to set up for the first time (they don't camp in Michigan winters). Disappointed to find out that it isn't a stand alone tent.  Not Amazons fault, it clearly states one pole, I just didn't think about it meaning that it wouldnt stand alone. Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground. Also it is a big large for a two man tent. Hopefully he will be able to use it eventually."
1,I love this backpack. It has the sleek look and the overall feel of a backpack. It is so small that it fits most bags and is light and easy to carry. The only drawback is that the straps are a bit loose. This backpack is still very comfortable for me and I'm not worried about the straps falling out. I'm very happy with this backpack. I just bought a new laptop and I am extremely happy with it. It's very easy to use and very easy to navigate. The only thing I wish I could add is that the design of the keyboard is very nice.
0,"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instructions except I used a planter and did 2 containers instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds.  After a few days in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it was growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it was full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it was growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered as I've been careful hoping to prevent that.  One of our two kittens eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bites some off and plays with it. I put some clippings in their nightly dinner. No issues with vomiting and they both eat it just fine.  At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the containers and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold.  I read that overwatering cat grass turns the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets.  Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though as mold growth has everything to do with moisture. The grass was lush, green, healthy, and the roots are strong and deep. 4 stars because it only lasted us a month but we will give it another shot.  USDA Organic. Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. The photo collage was after 5 days of growth, when the kittens first tried it. The last photo was on the 7th day, when the grass had become more full in growth. Smile. Recommended."

0,"As a frequent traveler to Chicago, I generally stay at the Sutton Court, but thought I would try a different boutique hotel. I will never stay at this hotel again. The first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet, leaving me absolutely claustrophobic! Actually the smallest hotel room I've been in in the U.S! I complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a 'premium' room -- still quite small, but manageably so. The bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. The location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the El (elevated subway - background noise), and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening. I will say that the free wi-fi was great. If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene, I'd highly recommend you take that. If you want a nice room in a great location, check out Sutton Place hotel instead."
1,Bought these for my 6 year old granddaughter. She loved them. They are a bit small for her but the kids love them. My daughter is 4 so it is not that big of a deal.

0,"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:  1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason  2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainly to add minutes to the movie;  3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;  4) lots of bad acting;  5) awful music of any genre.  SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.  The identity of the speed demon is so hilarious, it defies belief."
0,"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.  The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches. Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.  Pros: *Saves a ton of room *Hardware included that worked well *Easy to install  Cons: *None  Additional Considerations: Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.  Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars  If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
1,"Intriguing, suspenseful, and a quick read. The characters are well developed and believable, and the story flows.  I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.  The first one was a little repetitive, the second one was a little more on the predictable side.  I liked the ending, but I didn't like the way it ended.  I would have liked to see a bit more development on the relationship between the two main characters.

0,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him? I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow."

What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens. The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. The problem was with all of the down pillows etc. Don't they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. I think that this was another part of my symptoms. If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. Beware hidden costs. I will try somewhere else in the future. Not worth the money or the sneezing all night."

I will say right away that I am plus sized and these run small. I bought a 3X and unfortunately its like its painted on me instead of a little loose. Knowing that though, if you're thinner than me, or a different shape (I am an apple) I would buy at least a size up. I will say though I tested this just like any other clothing I get to test and review in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback. I don't hand wash. Anything. Ever. Thats what washing machines are for. Mine has a hand wash setting, so I decided to try putting the shirt in on that setting. I have used it for many hand wash only items before with no problem. Same thing this time. The shirt came through the wash and tumble dry on medium heat just fine. I would always recommend following the label instructions, but if you're lazy like me and want to try a machine, youd probably be ok. Even though I won't be wearing this shirt until I hopefully lose some weight, I do think its a lovely fabric, color and style. I found it very soft and quite comfy, albeit too tight for my liking. That being said, if you're into form fitting tops, you might want to wear this, I just prefer looser, more flowy tops.

I tried everything at both ends and the buttons to no avail. It looks great. It just had lousy performance. I would call the image at night crude compared to the Sightmark.

What I got was six bright Fully Dimmable bulbs for less than a third of the cost of the 100w GE dimmable I bought last year. They're also smaller, lighter and run cooler. They dim to 10%, while the more expensive GE bulb barely dims to 40%. I love it when a product exceeds my expectations and seeing the word dimmable on the box was a wonderful surprise.

0,"Acorn Media has provided the DVD with english subtitles which are helpful not only to people who have hearing impediments but to foreigners (specially when politician explain very quickly intricate schemes, with names of men we know nothing about). The story is very interesting from an historical point of view. It begins with Napoleon III being dismissed and ends some times after the Second World War is over. Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fights against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every days life is a sort of thrilling gambling. For instance, he resigns his charge, thinking the government will become aware it can't do without him; in case it doesn't  Randolph will found a new Tory group, modern, kenner on social issues, and overcome the old Tory party. We see how times are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper classes are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, goes to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other women of her time. With such  ""political beasts"" as his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) was so outstanding a stateman. Love stories don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic events occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minutes were hardly enough."
0,"High quality fitbit band that can be used as a backup/replacement band for your fitbit.  Band made of soft plastic material that is very comfortable.  No smell like other cheap brands and seem very strong.  Easily adjusted to my wrist size.  The fitbit unit fits well and works just as well as the original band.  I HAD RECEIVED THE ITEM FOR FREE/AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED HONEST FEEDBACK."

0,"Used these on my lathe because they are very hard to ""bump"" on and off by accident.  They work great."
1,I like when authors take time to explain the relationship between two characters. This book was a great read
0,"This is sturdy and lasted a couple of weeks. Even after the stuffing is pulled out, our dog still works on the outside. We buy it over and over because our dog loves working on it until she is successul getting all the stuffing out. And then some..."
1,Amazing read need to know what happens next.  I loved it.  I would recommend it.
0,Works great for my pc dedicated to Karaoke on our theater system.
0,"However, I really dislike that once it is applied to a terrarium, it cannot be removed/replaced without destroying it.  It doesn't output much heat, so for it's size, it's a little weak and I didn't end up finding it worth blocking so much visibility into my terrarium.  I suppose on a personal basis I would give it two stars, but in all fairness, it is as described as far as I can tell."
1,"This book had all the elements of suspense and romance. I really enjoyed this book. I just wanted to read more about the people,"
0,This cannister is exactly what it says it is. Easy to open and close and has a liner that is removeable and easy to wash. Doesn't show finger prints at all and wipes clean if you spill anything on it without having to polish marks off where it was handled. Very well made and stylish looking out on the counter.
1,"Even though not having the time to read the first part of the series, I was excited to read the second part. The second part was also fantastic!  This is a great story"
0,"The budget alternative to intel i7-4770. It runs cool, crunches 1080p 60fps rendering and lets me play gw2 with little to no lag. All for the same price as an i5. Don't let the xeon name fool you, this server processor can easily handle itself in the consumer environment."
1,These glasses work great. They are an easy to use and comfortable to wear. They are a bit bulky and bulky. I've had mine for about 2 weeks and it's great. I bought this to replace an old Kindle Fire which was defective. This one is still working and I am glad I purchased it. I did have to replace the Kindle Fire by a different brand. I just went to Amazon and got a new one.
1,"The VTech rocking horse is a fun addition to my collection of all things batty!Very nice.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up. The little one will probably love it for a while. I would buy this again, but maybe for a few more years.My son loves this car!  It is very well made and looks great on the wall.  It is a little loud and awkward for him to play with it, but the music is great and the cars are a nice touch.  I love that it is a little smaller than I thought it would be.My daughter loves this puzzle. She loves that there is a button on the side to select the colors"
0,"Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.  If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully."
1,"Another installment in the Harry Potter series, the Harry Potter series is a lot like the Harry Potter series.  The story is told from Harry's point of view, and it is interesting to see what happens to the characters.  Harry's one flaw is that Harry is such a complicated character.  There are a lot of people in the story who have flaws, but they are all very different.  This book is a lot like the Harry Potter books, with a lot of twists and turns.  The characters are interesting.  I loved the characters.  They are very realistic and believable.  They are definitely different from the Harry Potter books.  The plots are interesting, but I did not like the way the stories were told.  I didn't like how the characters were described.  I did like how Harry was portrayed as being a teenager.  I liked how the author used the story to tie the characters together.  I liked the way the author portrayed Harry and how he grew up.  I liked how he was portrayed as being a boy.  I liked the way the author talked about his childhood.  I liked how he was portrayed as being a boy.  I liked the way Harry grew up.  I liked the way the author portrayed the two.  I liked the way Harry"
0,"I heard about this from CNET and a few other places.  Thought for $20 had to try it out.  Hooked it up to some small JBL bookshelf speakers I had at home and plugged in my android phone.  While not audiophile quality (due mostly to the mp3 files i guess), the sound was fantastic.  Highly recommend this."

0,OK this  book  pissed  me  off  I  fell  in  love  with  Blaze  the  way  he  just  took  over  Pearl  it was  awesome . I  love  Tank  character  and  the  way  he  just  think  it's  okay  to  just  for  him  to  walk  into  Pearl's  life  and  take  over .  Now  Pearl  she  just  needs  to  get  herself  together. Can't  wait  to  see  what  happens  when  both  men  find  her  and  how  they  will  react  to  her wanting  both  of them  that's  going  to  be  interesting. Recommend  you  read  Tanks  book  1st  before  understand  Pearls  Blaze book  is  AWESOME  thanks
0,"So far the performance has been amazing. Running a i7-6700k with a Noctua NH-L9I and it idles under 30C and has never gotten over 68C. Will definitely buy again for my next build.  I had enough to do my processor and my girlfriends processor. So you could easily use this to do your CPU & GPU off one tube.  The other processor this was used on was an i5-7400 with a Corsair h80i and it idles at 17-19C. The other PC is SFF so that's why it isn't using water cooling and this one is."

0,"Great remake! It took me a couple of watches, but I loved the story and cinematography."
0,"This serves the purpose that it was designed to do, and was delivered promptly. It is as described. However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inforced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to."
1,"Upon first inspection, Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago, but appearances can certainly be deceiving. Best summed up, Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn. It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain, even if it is an international one. The customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea. The rooms are dirty when you first walk in, the air feels stale, and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be. None of this is worth a 'luxury' price or even worthy of a 'luxury' name. I will certainly not be staying here again."
1,"Love it, we have a small house and the stove is too hot. This is a great one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room."
1,"I got so tired of hearing about the fact that these two women were also gay.  This is a shame because the book is a must read for gay men, especially for gay women.  It is hard to be a straight man when you are going through this journey.  I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love reading about the lives of the characters.  The books are great and I like to read them again and again.  I hope the series continues.I loved this book.  I just couldn't get into it and am still reading it.  I love the characters.  It is a fun story and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.  I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.This is a very good book.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a little bit of history to read.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan"

It was good, but it had some issues with the story.  The first one was a bit of a cliff hanger, but I felt it was a good ending.  I just didn't feel it was as good as the other books in the series.  The second one was a bit more suspenseful, but I felt it was"
0,This movie was so stupid. The only good thing about this movie was Stuart Townsend but even he couldn't save this movie from getting more than one star from me. What were they thinking when they released this pile of trash?!
0,"nice light , price reasonable considering features and accessories. great beam pattern...spot flood combined. nice weight and feel, good flexibility as far as amt of lumens. feels sturdy though i wouldn't want to drop it. my only problem is the buttons are hard to feel, so you end up looking for the buttons as there is no real tactile way to find them except luck. i wish the buttons were larger, rubberized and more prominent. comes w car charger and case=nice. i did buy an extra battery and a diffuser as well from another site. considering the features, accessories, performance,weight,lumens, battery life, the price is very reasonable.people write ""its to big"" but they don't consider the battery life that you get with a light this size is amazing as it the weight of the flashlight."
0,I was using a competitor but switched to this to see. The way it was shipped was worth sticking with this. I have had other companies bottles leak everywhere or be slightly damaged. First bottle here was great. It's working well and my dog loves it. I don't notice a fishy smell but if there was he would love it even more.
0,Worked great!! A little hard to fold into the box !! But they looked great and stayed put once it was accomplished!
0,"The author may have gotten some tips from those classic MasterCard commercials which illustrate that money can buy some things, but certain moments and life experiences are ""priceless.""  Through the beautifully and simply illustrated tale of friendship between a cat and a dog (the interspecies metaphor alludes to openness and acceptance of differing points of view and experiences), we learn that material possessions and tangible items are sometimes not as meaningful as the space between two individuals, people, living beings, etc.  It is the unspoken, uncategorizable, sublime moments of life that are most fulfilling and rewarding, and the hardest to capture or describe.  Therefore, when trying to convey the depth of meaning of these moments, we cannot, and therefore, should not even bother trying (to encapsulate them, try as we may through photographs, video, blogging, etc.).  The best gift is one that one already has the power to give oneself--the gift of friendship, self-awareness/mindfulness and the ability to honor and nurture the two."
0,"So i will start out with i do LOVE the fox and the hound and it is one of my favorite disney movies so i was real excited when i got home, but then i open it and they put the two dvd's in the same slot and the blu ray in a seperate slot, ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  i wouldn't have payed the extra money to get the blu ray if i knew that they would end up having the dvds in the same slot, my dvd has a high risk of getting scratched now and there is nothing i can do too prevent it since there isn't even a sop for a swivel disk. HORRIBLE PACKAGING."
1,My dog had lice. I had to add an inch of peanut butter to make it work.  It is so small that it would be easy to get through a large dog.  This is a good product and I highly recommend it.I have two dogs and this is the only litter box I have found that does not break down. I had to use a second litter box to fill up one of them. Unfortunately I had to go to the local pet store and buy a new one because it is so expensive. I have used this litter box for years and it has never broken down. My dogs love it!I have a 60lb dog and he loves this toy.  It is very soft and

1,Originally I purchases this to go with the wide wooden legs of my Ikea. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The legs are tall enough to accommodate my larger desk and cabinets. It's a great addition to my office.
1,"If you're looking for luxuary, look no more. The Conrad is the best. I was in Chicago on business, and had to stay much longer than anticipated. A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did. The location is perfect, you're close to everything. The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel. I'll be back soon. Very Satisfied"
