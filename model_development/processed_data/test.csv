0,"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.  THE GOOD: + Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"". + 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do. + Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this. + Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad). + A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans! + 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON. + Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things. + Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!  THE BAD: - Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is - HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry, - ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.  BOTTOM LINE: GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person."

0,"After waiting for how many months to read another installment..... what a let down. First, nothing about Lindsey and who the father might be. Sorry Ms. Cunning but I am really disappointed in the new book. The writing is not her usual page turning, steam up your shower sex, the story was poor and the book did not advance any of the current story lines. There are plenty of up in the air plot lines to write about. Starting a new one is just annoying."
1,"This rug arrived within days of me ordering it. I will keep my review for the next couple months. I had a similar model before and used the Tumbler for years. It worked well and it is still working well. I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"" for my family's frozen pizza. I love the fact that it is a non stick surface. I just put it on top of the stove and it works great! It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food. The base is made of solid plastic so it does not stick to the stove.

1,"The Hyatt Regency in Chicago was a wonderful experience for my husband and I as we traveled through the area on vacation. After checking in we simply relaxed in the beautiful atrium for a while before going to our room. To our delight the room was very clean, ultra-modern and furnished with sleek and comfortable furniture. What really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views. We were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the Bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice! The food was simply fabulous. After dinner we were able to try out the fitness center, which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate. This was just what we needed as a restful base for our Chicago vacation and we will definitely stay here again."

I am very pleased with the quality of the product.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great quality tool.Great product!I use this to cut a nail and it works great!  It's easy to use and works great.  I've used it on the nail base, along with a nailer, and it's a great addition to my kitchen.  I used it on a nailer, which was a lot less work than I would have liked, but I don't think I would have purchased it for the nail base.  It's a great tool, but the nailer is a bit too large for my purposes, so I have to buy another nailer.  I like the nailer a lot.  It's a little bigger than I would have liked, but it's not so big that I would have had to use it.  I'm going to use it on a nailer, but I don't think I would have purchased it"

0,"I purchased this set for a trip to Florida.  I used the set on 2 different occasions.  The mask was a very poor fit and leaked no matter how much I tightened the straps.  The fins were the worst part of the set, the hard plastic on the sides of the fins constantly digs into the sides of your feet.  If you are going to use these fins, plan on wearing booties....  The snorkel worked fine. Overall, the set was a pretty big disappointment."
0,"For a Schwinn Product these mirrors are real ""Clunky"". They only come in LEFT side fittings. They don't stay in adjustment on ""Ball-socket"" & they swivel around on it. You also need to purchase lock washers to keep the stems from rotating around. I have had other mirrors work better for less money. I can't believe  Schwinn put their name on it. (The Ball Socket Should have set screws in them to keep the mirror in adjustment)."
0,"This is very good product at an exceptional price.  The thing that bothers me though is that it often seems to fry the foods at the ridges instead of grill.  In turn, there is an appearance of grilling but a fried texture.  This may be due to the width of the ridges and the non-stick coating.  However, I think this is common to all makes of these pans.  Face it, nothing beats a true grill.  Nice to have this when it is raining or just too cold to fire up the BBQ."

1,"Received it quickly with Prime. very pleased with the purchase. I will keep my son's interest and we will be buying more! I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great gift. It is hard to get the pieces in the box. My daughter is still waiting for her first birthday party. She's a huge fan of the show and the kids love to play with it. I just wish there was more to it. Great. I like that the pieces are very small and have a nice twist. The smaller pieces are nice and easy to store. My 5 year old has found the smaller pieces are difficult to put together and not as sturdy. I would definitely buy this again. Very nice item. I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he was obsessed with it. It's very cool and sturdy and he loves it. We had to go back to the original and put the pieces back together. It was a little pricey for a 5 year old and the price was a lot lower than we paid for it. I don't know if it's a quality issue, but it's a nice little toy. This is a great card for all my kids to have in their deck. The colors are vibrant and my kids love them. I like that there is a lot of cards that can be played with. My daughter loves this little train set!  It's a good size for a little child to play with. My 2 year old daughter loves this train set. It's very easy to assemble. It's fun for little hands.

0,"I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference, and had problems from the getgo. I had problems with the check-in even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file. The front desk clerks were kind of rude. The room was okay, not worth what I paid for. The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didn't feel very clean. They also charge for internet access, which is ridiculous. Most hotels provide free wi-fi. The conference food, which I assume is catered by the hotel, was not good at all. On the day of the check out, I had arranged for a late check-out, but in the morning before check-out time, someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in! Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. All in all, I would recommend staying somewhere else."

She has a lot of tea and they are perfect for the amount of water she needs.  I use them for everything.  The only thing I would change is the size of the top and bottom.  I don't have to worry about the tea getting stuck to the bottom.  I don't have to worry about that because I have a large tea kettle that I can just take out of the way and just pour it out.

The rooms were very clean and I slept well in the comfy bed. They have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that I took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside. My only issue was the battery for the TV remote died.

0,"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.  It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.  In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death."

0,"I've used this battery on a D50, D80 and D200. I bought 2 EN-EL3e's because most of my Nikon bodies provide very conservative battery power readings. If you are a Nikon user, you'll probably realize that Nikon has geared their Nikon digital camera bodies with memory card space and battery power meter with a ""glass is half empty"" approach. I was doing a shoot with my D80 and I thought I had a defective EN-EL3e because after 200 shots, the battery meter stated I had 44% battery power left. I ended up shooting well over 1000 shots and the meter was flickering from 30% to 60%. The same behaviour happened with my D50 and D200. Bottom line, Nikon's digital camera bodies have very inaccurate battery level meters. The EN-EL3e has a TON of juice on 1 charge and I am very pleased with it."

Looked like the pieces had a lot of dark areas, like they were all from next to boned. It also seemed greasy when breaking into smaller pieces. Tried to feed these to my pet 2 different times, thinking maybe the first time she had eaten them too fast or something, but she promptly threw up her stomach contents both time. This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago. I don't know what the issue is with this brand, it is supposed to have only 1 ingredient, chicken, in it. well it must be the crappiest, cheapest, most disease ridden chicken they can find. I purchase the Life Essentials brand by Cat Man Doo all the time --although they are for cats and come in much smaller bag-- these have NEVER EVER made my pet sick. NEVER!  Do not buy these.

0,"A mysterious letter, a family secret and a sense of wanderlust leads Keelin to leave her life in Boston to travel to a small coastal town in Ireland. It's there where she finds the truth behind her gift and a sense of belonging she's never known before.  This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.  I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.  Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked. I probably would continue this series because I found myself liking some of the secondary characters (who's book is next in the series) slightly more than I liked Keelin and her beau."

Whether you're traveling for business or fun, I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. I stayed there with my wife recently, we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun. The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. The hotel is in a central location, within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city, however, there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for, so there's barely a need to leave to hotel! (well, we DID leave the hotel to see the sights, but you know what I mean). My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities, including a relaxing massage. This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way, and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City."

0,"In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout). I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option. Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust. I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off. Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!! I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook."

1,"Something happens beyond 6 miles. I have an old stove that is still going strong. This is a great stove. I am using it for the colder months when it is not hot. I have been using it for a while and it is very effective. The only thing I would say is that it is heavier and I can't tell you how much lighter it is. I would recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is very easy to clean. I have a small, very light-colored coffee pot in my basement with a lid on it that is very easy to clean. I have to get the lid off the pot and take the pot to the kitchen for cleaning. It is not very easy to clean. I don't know if I have used it for anything but my coffee pot is pretty small, but that does not mean that I will have to clean it. The stove is very light and the lid is very light."

They are the villains and those without powers have either accepted it and given up or are doing their best to fight back. I loved the story and look forward to what Sanderson comes up with next."

The diver has good detailing with a nice print diving suit, some of which is in bright silver. On the back and front there is black-and-red upper body, the figure has a red helmet, red flippers, a grey air tank, and a transparent light-blue diving mask.  The yellow-and-grey scuba scooter has great detailing with rotating propellers, two harpoons and bendable arms which the diver can use to explore the sea floor and possibly to poke at the poor octopus. Lastly you have included in this set, is one light green seaweed-type plant on a round plate.  All in all a nice little set on its own, or great point to start collecting and adding to new Lego City Explores set."

0,"The questions I had about this product before I received it were: is it actually waterproof or just water resistant? Is it durable? Would the material crack? Well, it really is waterproof. It uses two very heavy-duty Ziploc type strips to seal the pouch and a very strong Velcro type strip to hold the flap down so the Ziploc type strips are not allowed to open. The material is soft, flexible, durable, and not likely to crack. So, if you must bring stuff with you and you don't want them getting wet, this is a good choice. I received a complimentary sample for a fair review."

Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.  Tip: if you have wood tables simply use a ceramic or glass flat salad plate to hold the mug. .

0,"I have the original game which I love and I thought that I'd buy the other continents for 2 reasons: 1.  others collect all the games so there must be some reason to want more of basically the same game. 2.  I wanted to use it to help my son learn the main places in africa (we used the original one to learn where main towns in the US/Canada were) and my opinion? re: reason #1...There is one added dimension, which is fun, and of course a different map that has a lot of cities that I'm unfamiliar with so it really twisted my brain, which is good, I guess.  But overall, I'm not sick of the first game enough to really need a second similar one yet.  If I was in the mood for ticket to ride, I would have just as happily played the first one.... re: reason #2...Although my son over time might become more familiar with some important cities in africa over time and have a basic idea where they would be, I feel that knowing which country they are in is very important and the lines showing the different countries are not there.  Also, many of the cities are ones that I don't feel he NEEDS to know, and finally, it's only the bottom half of the continent.  end opinion: I like the game but wish that I would not have spent so much money on a game that didn't really fulfill my needs.  I wish that it was all of africa, with countries identified, and only the most widely known cities in all of africa."

Amazon did not pkg very well. FedEx just sucks...  Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.  For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...  The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.  Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!  And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake..."

I used it for a couple of times VERY carefully and it broke anyways, so caveat emptor.  Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."

Wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city!! Our goldish was called Oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room!! All the staff were really helpful and welcoming, making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. Would certainly recommend this hotel."

The quality of this router is amazing. I can connect multiple devices at once and still get good signal with no issues. I have also tried multiple routers in the same area and these are the ones I use most. I recommend these routers to anyone who is considering purchasing one of these.

Cruise's portrayal of the American soldier turned student of the Samurai is amazing. All the actors' performances as the Samurai are exsquisite, the whole movie is amazing and powerful. Brought tears to my eyes."

0,"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.  While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure. Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.  In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft."

It's great for drilling holes or cutting into hardwood.  I use it for cutting with an impact driver and for cutting small nails.  The Bosch T6 is a good tool to have if you're working on a project.  I used it to cut a cut with a saw and a drill press.  It's a good tool.  The T6 is a solid tool.  I've found that it is a good tool for jobs where you have to be careful not to break the handle.  The T6 is a solid tool.  I've had no problems with the Bosch T6.  I'll be buying another.  Works great on a Milwaukee."

0,"These rain boots are comfortable and cute. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 in a regular shoe; I bought these in an 8. With socks on, the foot fits well around the arch, ankle, & heel (my mother, who has very high arches, did not find the arch as comfortable). The toe is roomy, but I like that. The ankle feels likes it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoes or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clips on the interior side of the calves are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comments have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your feet slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clips are not so large as to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement.  After all, they're made for stomping around in rain and mud, not to be worn as dress shoes or at runway shows, even though they are cute enough for that. ;)  Overall, I like them and would recommend them."

The author humanized this creature and his encounters with other fauna of the outback.

0,"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" has Argentina made such an amazing movie.  Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone.  There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begins high over a soccer (football) stadium, pans down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowels of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY.  Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that as it was happening.  Anyway, back to the story...it's epic.  Told somewhat in flashback, it covers over 30 years in the life of a government employee whose life was altered dramatically over choices made in his youth.  I can't tell you anymore of the plot, but I can tell you that you should definitely SEE THIS MOVIE!!  It's well worth it."

These two little old ladies stay in trouble with the sheriff, as they continue to run into murder after murder. They get into one scrape after another, but they solve the murder.  The one downside is that it needs better editing.  Use of I and me are incorrectly used often.  Spelling, punctuation, etc. could be improved upon.  It is not so bad as to ruin the story, however.  Can't wait to read the next book."

They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.  I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed.

Overall since it is black it has a slimming effect or look.  It has a wide collar that can be folded back or buttoned up around your neck.  The sleeve and body length is just right and overall the fits my wife's body style well.  I would recommend the jacket.  If you want to see it, do a search for a Gaiam womens jacket."

It is very comfortable, and I would return it and buy a smaller size, but I purchased as a lightning deal during Cyber Monday week, so it costs more now.  I completely did NOT follow the care instructions and washed in warm water, dried in the dryer in an attempt to shrink it and it did not shrink or fade!  AGH!  But - It is so comfy that I will cuff the sleeves and wear around the house, while keeping an eye out for these to go on sale sometime.  If it was the right size, this would be my very favorite jacket."
0,"We bought this TV two weeks ago. Ordered from Onecall via Amazon. TV arrived very quickly, in fact so quickly we had to postpone delivery so that we could be home to receive. Onecall delivers via a regional carrier which dropped it off in our garage.  First impressions. TV screen is huge. The TV itself is fairly thin and weights just under 100 lbs. Although it might be obvious, don't buy this TV if you are going to be watching it from few feet away. Too close to the TV and regular cable will look fuzzy since the low resolution is magnified to a 58 inch screen. Amazing picture quality with Blu-ray without any optimization. Regular DVD and HD cable have an excellent picture as well. We are viewing it from about 12-14 feet which i think is optimal. No motion blur with action sequences.  There isn't too much glare appreciable even a sunny room in our house. The viewing angles are excellent which is one of the reasons we choose plasma over LCD.  The audio speakers are okay to good but you are better off with a surround sound system if you have it. The TV does have a faint buzzing sound that you can hear if you turn off the volume. It isn't annoying and I believe it goes away as the TV warms up.  Overall, a great TV for a reasonable price ($2099 is the lowest recently offered.) If you are looking for a large plasma, check it out."

0,"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended."

Eventually mother and son go into hiding in which I can just feel their pain in having to start over in a place where they have no friends or family; no support and live in fear. How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position. It boils down to being a no-win situation to some degree. While some people did not like the ending, I did. I thought it was realistic and really does capture what's there at the end of the road."

The mattresses puffed up to full size in about 45 minutes with no odor. They feel magnificent, just the right amount of softness with solid support. We purchased the 10 inch queen for the guest room and after trying it out we immediately replaced our king with the 12 inch DreamFoam, it was that good. DreamFoam bedding has my highest recommendation. I really couldn't be more satisfied. Our previous mattress cost three times as much and wasn't nearly as comfortable. Buy this mattress, you won't regret it. Also, thank you for making good on the three day delivery right to my front door. I know this review sounds too good to be true. It has been a long time since I have been this happy with a purchase. Both mattresses really did exceed my expectations."

Here it is New York Cheesecake. 2 pounds cream cheese 3/4 cup white sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 cup sour cream 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 6 tablespoons melted butter 1/4 cup white sugar Directions 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). 2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes. 3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust. 4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping. Upgraded to 5 stars because of this recipe!"
0,"I like this product line, and have had these for years.  This model is a bit odd, seems a bit less thick and sturdy a material than others that I've owned.  I'm sure it will be fine, but it isn't quite as good as the older models.  When using this, if you do big activity with you dog, like chasing a ball with a long leash attached, if they go too far and pulls on this too much, it can come unsnapped.  It has happened a few times while at the park, while the dog is chasing the ball, with a 25 foot leash attached.  The plastic snaps come undone, somehow, and thankfully my dog doesn't realize it and I can re-secure it quickly."

0,"In <i>Tempting Her Fake Fiance</i> we meet Stasia, a small newspaper reporter and blogger, who has just come out of a divorce. She is in Las Vegas getting an interview with the highly sought after Evan Stone. Evan is grappling with issues concerning his family needing him to be the man of the house when he meets Stasia. His guilt is what catapults him into the idea of faking their engagement, while in turn helping her build more confidence and shoving it in her ex-husbands face publicly. I thought the premise behind the story was great, but when it came down to it it kind of did play out just like a Lifetime Romance movie to me. Now as I say that it doesn't mean that the story wasn't cute, but it was just cute to me.  It had some juicy X rated scenes, but all in all it was mostly a demure chemistry between the two, that turned into a lovely love story. In the end the two will end up finding something that neither of them expected or really wanted."

1,"When I ordered this I was a little worried about it being a little too large for my dog. It's not the largest I've seen and is a little tight on the dog's chest. It is still a good size for a dog that's a little bit big.  I think it's great for a smaller dog, but the fact that it is a little too big makes it a little more difficult to put together. The metal bars on the sides are very thin, so it's hard to get the hang of. I've had it for about a month now and it's still pretty much in perfect condition. It's a nice size for my dog to get on, but I don't think it's worth the cost of shipping to the store. I've had it for a while now and it's still looking great.

My complaint is the poor service at every stage - the check-in was slow (even at 1am), the concierge (Sarita) was hopeless, staff were generally rude. Also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night - we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning. Finally, just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse!!!

1,"True to Kay Arthur's study of the relationship between the two characters. There is a strong connection to the two characters that is often missed by many readers, and the author is very clear that it is a relationship between Kay and Stephanie, both of whom have come to terms with their feelings for one another. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of it. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of the relationship with Kay, and Kay is determined to get Kay out of it. The story is not only about Kay, but about Stephanie, and the book is full of both of them. There is a lot of action, and a lot of twists and turns, but it is not the most compelling story. My only criticism of the book is that the ending was a bit abrupt. There was a lot of tension in the book, and the ending was not unexpected. However, the plot of this book was well paced, and I was very excited to read the next book in the series. I have never read a book that was so abrupt that I felt like I was in a story."

0,"Listen - we know we are not alone when we say reality TV has hi-jacked network and cable television and most of it isn't really a positive force in life with its usual focus being on the nastier side of the human condition (fighting, jealousy, lying, cheating, etc. etc.) and at some point we have simply given up - so what to do after?  We became our own T.V. station!  We stopped paying the cable company hundreds and hundreds of dollars for programming we don't like (because complaining about modern television is about as helpful as peeing up hill) and we channeled that money into DVD/Blu Ray purchases of shows we know we love and this one was one the list!  Green Acres is the story of a New York lawyer who has always dreamed of owning/operating a farm - a true pioneer in the 'Back to the Land' movement (John Denver would have been proud).  But not everything is what it seems when Mr. Haney sells him a piece of useless land, a broken down house, an 'antique' tractor, and everything else one might need.  When Mr. Douglas seems too starry eyed and naive to notice his high society wife is only too happy to point out the problems.  What happens next is anyone's guess in this zany half hour comedy which we can't seem to stop watching  (even our teen daughter).  CBS made a total miss-step when it canceled this show as part of their not-so-bright cultural war against country themed shows in the so called ""rural purge"" of 1971 - at least we got 170 episodes (over many seasons) to remember it by."
0,"Pros: pretty easy to install, delivers a nice stream of water, good spray pressure, feels sturdy after install, can do the handle left or right, color I wanted. Cons: almost returned because its super tall and clunky looking (not rustic, but not refined), the pull down nozzle does not pull out or retract very smoothly, the pull down nozzle does not set back in place without being very deliberate. I did way too much research and found that most pull down faucets have issues, so I had lowered expectations. I thought I might regret switching from a decent regular kitchen faucet to an arch with a pull down - but it is a very good change. Thought the soap dispenser might be a disappointment - but its been great and super easy to refill. There aren't too many black faucets available currently - I really like black or oil rubbed brass, but oil rubbed bronze is popular right now, which I don't like. UPDATE: 11/17 have had this 2.5 yrs now, the finish is still nice, but the pull out doesn't always want to stay in place, which is a bit of a bummer, also the switch between stream and spray sticks."
0,"Collar works as advertised, but I do not recommend the shock portion. Ive had other shock collars for my wild dog and bought this one as a replacement for one that ate batteries. The shock option literally burned my dogs skin and caused a sore. i did not realize until a couple of days later after i took the collar off to adjust it. I have never had this happen before with other collars and would compare it burns left by a cattle prode. Even at a low setting, my dog yelped. I am an owner who uses this to correct bad behavior, not to torture. Im pretty sad that this thing is so extreme but the vibration and noise settings are just fine."

0,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).  Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.  So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!"

This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.  What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.  What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.  Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."
1,"This is the second copy of this item.  The first one was for my computer and the second copy was for a phone.  I took the third one and the fourth one and now it's a little smaller.  I'm glad I did.  I'm happy I did.  I'm not a fan of the sound quality of the speakers on these computers.  They are very loud and the speakers are not as loud as they sound.  It's very annoying.  I have to get my computer speakers to work, and I'm not sure how long I'll have to wait.  They work great.  The sound quality is not great, but it's ok.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.This is a great camera for the price.  I was able to find some great reviews for it, but I haven't found any good ones.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price.I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this.  The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the lens is a bit wide open, so you can see your subject better without the ability to see where you are looking.  I had a little trouble getting it to open, but after a few minutes it was just a little bit wider.  I am very happy with the camera and would buy again.  The quality is good.I've had this for 2 months now.  It works great, but I'm not sure if it's because I have it plugged in and connected to a different router.  I haven't tried to switch to the router,"

0,"I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more."

0,"(My picture shows LeapPad WITH the gel skin case on-sold separately) My 3.5 year old son loves his ""tablet!"" We have cartridge games, and have purchased games directly on the tablet. Super easy to navigate. The camera, video recorder, and voice recorder are actually his favorite features. I cannot compare this tablet to other LeapPads, as this is the first one we have owned, but we do love it. It seems the biggest difference is this tablets ability to play imagicard games. We personally found the cards are nuisance, and don't use them. You don't even really need them,  but we do love the Paw Patrol Imagicard game...we just play without the cards. We did have an issue with it freezing on us once, but we're able to reset, and it's never done that again. A real tablet like an iPad obviously runs faster, has a better resolution, and more features, but the LeapPads are Ad free, which means this Mommy is worry free! I hated all the ads and pop-ups that occurred when my son plays games on our tablet or phones. Everything he plays on the LeapPad is educational, unlike many of the pointless games he played on the iPad. I also scored my tablet right before Christmas for around $65 dollars! That's right, this LeapPad platinum cost me $65! I price watched using CamelCamelCamel.com. So in short, certainly no iPad, but much more clean educational entertainment than an iPad....so IMO a better purchase!"

Otherwise, this is merely a nostalgic rehash of other, better movies, but, that isn't to say it's completely lifeless.

0,"Mr. Barzun, has on page 739 attempted to define novels as opposed to tales. He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about ""detective tales"" seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a ""tale"", i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader."

One day was almost too long.
0,"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)  Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get: (1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom."

0,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.  The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.  I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.  The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!  I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."

0,"First let me say, I try not to be too critical, but in some cases the truth is warranted! We checked in and things seemed fine. Location was excellent. Woke up the first morning, to a slightly rumpled bed covered in 'stains', I hope-filthy and not 4 star hotel quality. Requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door- a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign, I did and no one even came until later in the day. The room was big enough, had no drawers, suposedly remodeled but carpet didn't reach the wall, toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken. The mirrors were great and the water was always hot! The walls were paper thin, I heard every conversation the guests next door had. They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t.v. through the walls and vents. Internet was $13.00, worked for a bit and then not again, I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later. The hotel did give us a credit for the charges. At this point, enough was enough, we packed our bags and checked out. The front desk was very helpful- kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops!!"

The size is perfect. This briefs is still very comfortable for the long term. I highly recommend it. I had to return it because the shoes were too small. I went with the Large and they fit perfectly. I love these shoes! I have been wearing them for years now and I have been wearing them for hours everyday. I love them. They are so comfortable!  I have had some bad luck with some of the other shoes on the market and I have been to a few different stores and bought some more. I have had no problems with them and they look great.

0,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."

0,"This quick dry towel was absolutely perfect for a 12 day backcountry camping trip through Montana.  Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.  Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry."

0,"I saw this movie with my children today and on a scale from 1-10 I give it a ZERO. There is one character who broke out of jail and came back to get some ""parchment with a magical message""  which he believed he deserved to receive.  In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is  ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED  MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM. THINK TEN TIMES BEFORE LETTING YOUR CHILDREN SEE THIS MOVIE."

1,"**I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This book was awesome. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance. The characters were well developed and the storyline was full of action. I liked the fact that it was free, and it was a free book. I just didn't care for it as much as I did the other books I read. Overall, I liked this book. I really enjoyed this book, it was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a short story. I read it in one sitting. I'll be looking for more by this author. I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is determined to be happy. She doesn't want to go back to her past and finds the man who she loves. This story is a great read. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The romance is great, and the story is a great follow up. This is the second book in the Standalone Series. I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review. I am a fan of the author's writing and this one had me hooked. I am looking forward to the next book. I am not sure if this is a continuation of the series, but I am not sure it will be a standalone, so I am not sure I will read the next book. It is a great read."

0,"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.  Update 12/14/2010.  This was my first experience returning a purchase to Amazon.  The process was painless, and the refund was quick."

I have found that babies love the crinkling noises best and these have very large wings that are easy to manipulate to make the sound.  My kids all loved the ladybug teether and the bright colors as well. This has a large strong clip that stays securely attached to the stroller, car seat and diaper bag. They have pulled so hard on this toy many times, putting their full weight on it and it doesn't stretch open and pop off like other clip-on toys have. I have thrown ours in the washing machine on gentle a few times and it has held up beautifully."

This box makes it so easy for us to pack and fun for our daughter to eat. It holds plenty for little ones, probably through elementary school, and is great for portion control and for making sure all of the food groups are represented (I am a stickler for putting the correct type of food in each compartment). We had a problem with one of the hinges from the beginning and I wrote to Yumbox about it and it was replaced at no charge within a week. Very pleased with the product and with their customer service!"
0,"I Compare this movie to inception because tht was the last sci-fi action movie I saw that was better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a lot). This is a solid adult sci-fi flick. The first act of the film is intriguing and shows a lot of promise. It plays out a little slower more in a drama fashion or the middle third of the film. And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.  As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind. It's a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I would go with low expectations and you might find that there are some interesting concepts at play (poor Seth).  Loved the way the film was shot. The audio mix is good and the editing is pretty great (Pulp Fiction style time structure). This will be a good Blu-Ray no doubt."

Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."

The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is based on a novel by the late Robert Burns.

Superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. Excellent service all round and nice staff. For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed.

0,"Having had to sit through the ""horror"" films that the Hollywood studios have given hideous birth to these past couple of years, I was in the mood for some good old fashioned imported hair raising terror. I had read about this film before going to see it, mostly because I had read a novel of the same title by Jeff Long which is about a terrifying cave exploration gone wrong, but this movie directed by Neil Marshall is a completely different story although similar in its originality. I dragged my husband to see this last night, promising him a different experience than all the horror movies as of late. We both are sick of paltry remakes of Japanese films, and big budget stinkers that involve lots of water and hair, and rely heavily on computer generated scares , This movie is a serious monster movie for a generation without monster movies. I really missed the good old days where the baddies were flesh and bone; the stories were fresh and didn't need too much elaboration, and I had the chance to see some unknowns get massacred. This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying ""okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it"" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the ""the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc"" out of my system. I cant wait to buy this on DVD and see the other ending, any extras, and relive one of the best movies I have seen in years."

0,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.  The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.  Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale. The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.  It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.  My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.  This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book"

0,"Three nights there on business. Hadn't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement, very bleak. Told the front desk that I hadn't realized about the construction, so I'd have to switch hotels, they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights. So I stayed. TV didn't work. Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me...eventually after I called again, a few hours later, a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it. Long and complicated experience at the business center (which doesn't open until 9am, BTW), where I ended up paying $45 to print 55 pages. Had to buy these cards, and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway, (and charging me for them). I was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago, 2000 miles from where I live. I asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that. Nice room, nice view, but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad. Worst experience I've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business."
0,"How cute (or sexy!) are these? What a fantastic idea, they took something that was needed by millions of women (chafing guard) and made it both practical and adorable. They come in a handful of colors here on Amazon as well as their website (where I ordered mine.) I got them in Black. For me, the size small was just right. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE - don't make any assumptions on your size. How embarrassing would it be if this fell down because you got it too big.  This is very well made and has built in clear silicone rings - one at the top and one at the bottom. These are what keep it from sliding up or down. I tried really hard to a get a good photo to show the rings, but couldn't get the exact quality I was hoping for (because they're so clear.) I also took a photo of me wearing it down low on my thigh - I wasn't comfortable posting a photo in the proper place, and because it's lower than I wear it, I had to hold it in place with my hand. You get the point from the picture...  This works well to protect against chafing in dresses, skirts, short and pants. While it's not marketed as any kind of secret storage, it CAN (in my opinion) be used for this within reason. To do this, it's critical you get the right size... you COULD stick your ID, a CC and some cash inside the band (between the clear bands). It may even hold a cell phone, but I haven't tested it with anything that weight.  Overall, I really like these! Adorable (and sexy), and practical. I like mine and recommend them for others. I hope this review has helped others considering this purchase."

The hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit, they give no info for any activities going on in Chicago.

The author did a splendid job of introducing each of these boys and the men who trained them, their backgrounds, and their families.  My mind made a movie as I read each page; it was as though I knew them.  In the course of history it is a rare thing when this caliber of people gathers in one place to accomplish one thing, and it was such a pleasure to watch it grow and come to fruition.  These were exceptional young men who took with them through life the lessons of perseverance and determination they learned via rowing; they became wonderful men who were a credit to their families and to America.  The writing style was perfect for me; it flowed so well. I read at the end of the day when my mind is spent, and I never had to struggle to remember where I was or what was happening; I could just pick it up and read."

0,"Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.  From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.  But she's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think."

0,"I'll be damned if the secrets and treachery wasn't at an all time high. Toni had me confused for a minute but I kept reading to make sure I wasn't going crazy. Brielle, Chelle and Meachy all found themselves caught up but I wasn't expecting the secrets that came about. Blake was just trifling and doing the most. Here I thought he was messing up one situation but so much more came with it. Brielle was wrong but it was nothing she could do to change the way things panned out. I liked Brandon and his boldness at dinner and that really had me cracking up. I was pissed about the lie he told at his office but I guess he was doing what he thought was best. Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass. I'll admit I had a wtf look once Chelle found out Brielle's secret because I was thinking how in the world can she be mad when she's no better. Monique was bitter and wanted her cake and eat it too. Her response to KJ let me know she didn't have it all. Once the secrets started flowing it was like they'd never end. So much trust was broken but the very secrets that destroyed so much also had some good to come about. As always great job Toni and I can't wait to see what you come out with next."

It is an ultimately heartbreaking ending that caps off one of the best films that I have ever seen.  You owe it to yourself to see this one.

0,"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.  Pros: +The size assortment is good for many tasks + The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack. +++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great! + There are a lot of cords in the can.  Cons: - I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.  Summary:  I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip."

0,"I rarely write reviews, but I found this book to be wonderful. It was sad and funny. Although the review I read in a magazine said that the grief felt by the parents for their son was incidental to the funny situations was not correct. I thought the grief the parents felt permeated the book. As a parent, I keenly identified with their shattered lives.  The thing I liked best about this book was the gentle and forgiving way the characters were written. Although they were ordinary and had many flaws, the author treated them all with dignity and respect. Often writers who portray ""ordinary"" characters make them seem pathetic and/or ridiculous. Stuart did not demean them for their ordinariness. The characters were real, and I could identify with them because of their faults.  I laughed and cried, which is a cliche, I know, but in any event, it was a wonderful book."

0,"Was easy to setup and works very well. We unplugged the COX modem, but did NOT remove the battery (the instructions say the battery should be removed). We waited about 15 seconds, and then turned on the COX modem, after connecting it to the wifi router (which was turned on).  The 1 yr old HP laptop found the TP-Link router and easily connected with the provided password on the box (rather tiny font). Then, we went to the 198.etc. address and changed the signin and the password to our satisfaction. The COX modem, if connected with the cord, gets us 90+mbps, and 7+mbps upload; without the cord, ie., wifi only, a few inches away, we get 85+mbps. When we took the laptop down the hallway and 2 rooms away (it is an old brick house), we got 45+mbps, which is far above what is needed for videos - a min of 10mbps for smooth viewing-, and the same 7+mbps upload rate.

0,"I am not much of a complainer, as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site, but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago: My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006. The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone. The receptionist was outright rude, but took the reservation without a mistake. During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent, the waiters, the managers, nobody was friendly, nor tied to accommodate us. [------------------------] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour's party. The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions. When we returned from the reception at 11:50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. 'Nobody told us, we can't do anything for you.' 'Are you sure that you arranged this?' Two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again. I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]"

0,"I would be tempted to give this a 3 1/2 if Amazon allowed that option. The short version is that I can see this for the lower age child if she has an interest in robots or computers. But kids want more from their electronic toys.  Middle aged adults who don't care about electronic toys shouldn't receive this as a gift.  (Not referring to myself by the way, I love electronic toys)  I've bought severeal WowWee products over the years including the Robosapien and the Roboraptor.  This is the first one that I had to download an app to fully appreciate-- It says in the product information that it works without the app but given the limitations I'm not sure that I would buy this without access to either an ipad or a smart phone.  My ipad is a bit outdated and the app would not download to it, so I downloaded it to my Samsung III phone which worked ok. I think this is the oldest Samsung that it would work with by the way.  Like all of the WowWee products I have bought it does not come with a battery so I had to supply them.  It also has a compartment for the batteries that requires a tiny screw driver. I don't know if they plan to upgrade the app but it doesn't do a lot of different things-- makes noises, the face on the screen changes, and it can run through a simple routine of turns and straight movements.  A ten year old lost interest in it pretty quick but a 7 year old was more intrigued.

It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.  One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.  UPDATE:  The knife has been back in the USA and I haven't had to return it yet.  I'm very happy with it."

0,The author could have gone into more depth about covert bigotry.  THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.  The author should be commended for presenting the bigotry on the part of Muslim's and that it cuts both ways.  Maybe more depth would have been possible if not as much time was spent on the grieving that takes place after you lose your spouse.
1,"Love, Life and Everything Else (Cora Deleuze's book)  The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.  This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The only thing I would change is that I will be reading more of these stories by this author.I have enjoyed all of the books in this series.  I have read all the books and will continue to do so"

I used to keep all my siverplate, serving pieces, and napkin rings in a silverware box that was so big it had to be put in a closet where it quickly got stacked with ""stuff"" or put up too high to get without a stepstool. It seemed more bother than it was worth to use. Now all my pieces are close by and fit neatly in a smaller plasic container that fits in the cupboard with the good china.  It was so easy to set the table for my last dinner party with the ""good stuff"". I especially like that I can pull out just the number of place settings that I need without having to bring out the entire service. I haven't had them long enough to see how well they prevent tarnish, but they definitely are convenient and keep the silverplate from getting scratched."

0,"We used these to make vampire donuts, using plain glazed donuts from the grocery store, and used skittles as the eyes. These did work, but the hinge portion on some was too thick and they popped open a bit, on a few of them. Poor QA/QC there, I think!  We solved that by closing/folding them closed first and pressing hard with a metal serving spoon and creasing and reinforcing that folded hinge area, and then placing them in the donuts. It worked great!  We scattered them on tables, in among bags of pretzels and wrapped candy, and also placed these in big glass jars with spooky printed labels we stuck on the fronts. They're small, so only the kids could really wear them comfortably, but they worked great for our purposes."
0,"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!  You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!  I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.  If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.  Still, I don't regret this purchase at all!"

0,"Kids love this toy and it spans quite a few ages. It spurs their imagination and creativity to pretend they are in a store. When a couple of kids are together one or two can shop and one can take turns being cashier. They love scanning random things and hearing the voice say a price. They love getting on the microphone saying, ""Clean up in aisle 7"" type stuff. My sister who has oodles of toys for visiting nieces and nephews had this for years and I have watched kid after kid happily using this toy. Hers is still working and it has through rough toddlers and kid tussles etc. I just bought this one from Amazon for my grand-daughter.

0,"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money."

0,"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received. First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus. Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range. Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect. Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars."

0,"I was very disappointed to find that there is NO Vimeo app available, as it has been for previous models.  I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.  Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""  Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.  *** three month update *** Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.  With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.  Rating now downgraded to two stars.  My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony. I've been a die-hard Sony fan since my first spectacular Trinitron TV in the 70's. It's been a sad downhill slide in the past decade, I can see why they are losing mega-bucks."

As noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. The lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. The concierge, Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). We had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk.

0,"I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott. We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators, which are used all night long. When speaking to the front desk, I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor, which I had requested for a better view. I am looking at a brick wall, and getting no sleep. He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor, and were aware of the noise problem. Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this. If you decide to stay here, request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator! I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences.

0,"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.  I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!"
1,"I almost didn't buy this, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the collection. Great product. Great price! I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is by far my favorite. It is a great set. I would recommend this to anyone. I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she loves it! She is a little rough with it but she has had no problems with it. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too hard for her to put together. She is 5 and she loves it. I ordered this for my 6 year old son for Christmas. He loves it. We had fun building it on his own. He has learned a lot from the pieces and I think it will be a great addition to his collection. I think it is a good size for a small child. My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train. He plays with this every day."

1,"I never thought I'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. I am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. I have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. So when my sister was getting married in Chicago, I was extremely anxious. The front desk associate, Rosa, was wonderful. She told me that they have Allergy friendly rooms. No perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded 'industry standard' feather pillows. I booked a room, but was still really worried. I shouldn't have been. Ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. Maybe even a little better. They had an air purification system for our room. It smelled so fresh! While my husband took our daughter to the Big Bar for Nachos (she never stopped talking about how 'totally cool' it was), I ordered room service for my son. The man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. My son has a lot of food allergies, so I was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. That's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. I was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. The only problem with my stay is that it was too short. We're coming back for our first family vacation since Ethan was born. Thank you, Hyatt Regency Chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!"

I wouldn't say fantastic because of its strange rear ""increment"". Anyway, better than the Acer Aspire.

0,"Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services. First of all, from reading other reviews, now I know I got ripped @ $249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $79 (albiet, I got free wifi). The hotel is nice; but it can only get so nice for an oldie...no matter how much money you dump into it. Shower head was really low (I'm 6'1'), water pressure was low. It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by (check out reviews on Yelp!) For some off reason I ended up with two double beds (they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone). If traveling here: 1 - make sure you get a better deal than I did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - Don't have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class (although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple...it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers (sp?) trying to save money."
0,"So this is real-life anime. Wow. I'm stunned. Where Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress failed, Tokyo Godfathers greatly achieves. I loved this film. It's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time. We've all struggled--some to the point of being homeless. We've all had defeating family issues. And we've all wanted nothing more than to get away; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package.  And the story itself is touching. How can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother? These three very unique individuals struggle to no end, facing bodily harm, organized crime, AIDS, and a possessive father, just to get this tiny little child to a safe place, a home, where it can be loved. And all of their efforts comes across as genuine. Excellent."

0,"My Generation 4 Glock 23's take-down lever was so short, getting firm contact with it for disassembly was very difficult for me. The 'King Glock Competition Slide Lock' replacement was the answer. The serration cuts on the new lock are aggressive and protrude out from the frame just far enough so I now can get positive contact for easy disassembly. I had my local gun shop's armorer do the install which took him all of about 2 minutes and at no charge. After he installed my new slide lock he commented he that liked this part better than the factory lock on his G19 and was going to get one for his pistol as well. Finally, this new part does not interfere with holstering my G23 in or out which I thought you might like to know. All in all I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the 'King Glock Competition Slide Lock'."

The instructions are well written and installation was a snap.  You will want to experiment with the sensitivity setting to suit your needs.  When set to the most sensitive setting, the lights were picking up passing cars on the street, so I had to use the mid-range setting, which detects moving objects on my property but not in the street.  The lights seem to be of good quality and should last many years beyond the manufacturer's warranty."

0,"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have."
0,"I am impressed with each and every 'Reproduction Barbie Doll' that I own. I bought one for each of my four granddaughters, with the hopes of keeping this iconic legend alive. Barbie is educational because she encourages socialization and etiquette through role play. Of course, you need more than just the doll. I also bought the basic accessories and a few extras. A school classroom set will add to the fun. Also, a dining room, table and chair set with miniature dishes will teach the girls how to set a proper table and reinforce manners. However, the real role playing can only be taught by a good role model. That includes explaining that Barbie's body measurements are not realistic. This could lead to a discussion about being comfortable with our curves or lack thereof. Maybe even a discussion of anorexia versus obesity. That is why I highly encourage mothers (and grandmothers) to spend some time playing with their daughters. The magic moment is when you watch your girls playing alone or with friends and see how they reflect your positive influence. That, in turn, is carried throughout a lifetime. There's a reason Barbie is such a beloved, classic icon."

0,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:  P1: Everything that exists has a cause  Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:  P2: The universe exists. ------------- C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)  But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.  This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!  For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:  P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence. P2: The universe began to exist. ----------- C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).  Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.  One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.  That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."

0,"I don't remember the last time I read ""David Copperfield.""  I've heard it said that this book of Dickens' is somewhat autobiographical, but I don't know for sure.  One thing I've enjoyed since I bought my 3 Wordsworth Classics is the exposure to 18th century English culture through Dickens' wonderful prose.  ""David Copperfield"" will have to wait until ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Great Expectations"" had been read through first."
0,"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.  This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).  I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own."" This was a piece of television history when T.V. wasn't loaded down with reality shows and poor shows. Get this show on DVD, you won't be disapointed."

0,"Have had this camera since March, and I love it. I had a Digital Elph before this, so I was a little spoiled by how tiny they are and how easily they fit into a pocketbook, but this one can fit, too... just a little bulkier because of the ""hump"" for the batteries.  It takes clear pictures and video, has withstood my dropping it, and does a good job of focusing on faces.  Two negatives: first, the lag between photos can be unbearable, particularly when the flash has been discharged. I tried taking pictures in a theatre and had to wait literally about 30 seconds in between shots... which is terrible when you're trying to capture something as it's happening! When I loaned the camera to someone, she told me, ""I'd return it if I were you. I have no idea how you stand that.""  Thing is, I love just about everything else about it. If I had the money, I'd buy a different camera to use indoors and keep this one for the outdoors/good lighting shots.  The other negative is that it really isn't great with red eyes. My whole family is prone to red eyes, and haven't yet found a camera that reliably fixes that problem.  I'm still a fan."
0,"Dracula too long & too slow  Keanu Reeves was probably the weakest link.  His British accent has been described as too posh.  His acting is wooden & unconvincing.  Winon Rider is fine though her British accent is also overdone (though more convincing than Keanu's).  The costumes and makeup are amazing  Frankenstein  Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together  While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.  Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?  There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier."

0,"We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend, and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived. Is it just me, or is this information not clearly stated on their website? A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming. The room itself was fine. More bland and generic than the 'European elegance' claimed on their website. The lack of hot water, was definitely not fine though. There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel. The location is good, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. These few good points certainly did not redeem our experience, and I wouldn't pick this place again, even post-construction."

I received my package today and check on the content and what I found out - all that was originally released for the Special Editions of Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray are all there. I am not sure if the comparison was the older DVD Ultimate Edition versions of Toy Story but for the Blu-Ray editions, its all featured.  The packaging is quite nice - cheap cardboard I doubt it. Of course, if handle with care it is durable. Still, while the placement of the disc I felt its best if its in a casing, the foam that holds all ten-disc is something I would rather avoid. The box is rather big and the extra stuff which was stuck on the box is rather annoying.  If you love Toy Story series and for those that have yet to own the previous DVD or Blu-Ray editions, this is worth forking out to own this edition."

Be prepared for hours of fun.  Here is the general idea:  First, get a group of people wanting some social fun Second, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are) Third, start with someone called the ""jusdge"" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are) Fourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.  The person who is the round's ""judge"" tosses out a card that is a descriptor.  Let's say that the word is ""Hot.""  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a word that embodies ""hot.""  One player might toss in ""Marylin Monrow"" and another might toss in ""The Sun.""  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!  This is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.  Note: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries."

First of all, the plasma TV in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available, and they weren't particularly apologetic about it, either. Secondly, it was supposedly a non-smoking hotel, but as an ex-smoker, I can tell that people had smoked in the room recently. Additionally, the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels, which was really disappointing, because I was looking forward to using the pool. Finally, check-out was supposed to be at noon. At 11:15 am, the maid was knocking at the door. She asked if I would be out soon, and I thought was very quite intrusive.

I did have to remove the strap on the back of the phone because I was worried about the screen falling out if I bent it over."

1,"Always wanted to do something else with the pieces, but I didn't want to throw them away.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do think is a little expensive is the fact that it is made of a hard plastic. I think it's pretty tough to break it, but the plastic is hard to crack so I'd rather get a different set of pieces. I think the metal is stronger than the plastic, so if you want to crack it, just put the pieces in a plastic bag and it will break easily.  Pros:  - The plastic is durable, it doesn't fall apart easily. - The pieces are easy to crack, the pieces are made of solid plastic.  Cons: - The plastic pieces don't"

The choices in this set are fun and clearly created for a girl, and they have instructions on how to create several options in the box that are easy to follow. Overall this is a solid set if you have a girl who likes building and who enjoys pretend play, as it allows you to create a princess and some animal friends to play within the built structures."

0,"This little anime here truly emphasizes the very fact that Japan is quite obsessed with wistful visions of a fantasy-perfect high-school lifestyle completely saturated with glittery magic, action-adventure, and flawless  youth. Quite similar to the famous master of manga, Osmau Tezuka's  ""Knight of Ribbons"" where a young princess dresses up in a male  garb to embark on a soul-searching odyssey, Utena with her cotton  candy-pink hair and sparkling blue eyes dons a boy's school uniform and  dates the other girls at a very swanky academy school where young children  of the mythical land attend. Then Utena meets a very mysterious black girl  with startling green eyes and lavendar curls at a rose-choked greenhouse  where she tends to the colorful flowers. And Utena sees her get slapped  around. So she challenges the tormenter to a duel, which would take place  in the great ivory arena up in the heavens right underneath a floating  inverted castle. And wins. Thus the ""Rose Bride"" quite gratefully  throws herself at Utena's feet - much to her unwillingness to claim her. A  very misty-eyed fantasy tale filled with princely (princessly?) heroism,  chivalric romance, theatrical drama, lots of swashbuckling action, ideal  visions of innocent childhood and adolescent rebellion, and lesbian  suggestions. Quite sweet and fairy-like!"

I camped with a lean-to tarp configuration instead of a tent. The temperature dropped to about 35 overnight. I got sweaty in the bag because I sealed myself in it completely (head and face) which caused moisture to build up in and around the bag and allowed me to get cold. However, I'm confident it would keep me warm in the same conditions if I kept my nose and mouth outside of the bag when sleeping.  Overall, this bag looks great, feels comfortable, packs away small, doesn't weigh much, and is warm.  I would recommend to a friend as a backpacking bag."

0,"I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them. Pros: What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun. Cons: Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me) Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier) The shells- A. They tend to jam B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault. Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing. So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading."

The low rating is for the ridiculously complex and counter-intuitive programing which renders it essentially useless beyond the basic function of telling the temperature remotely. I just built a pc and found it easier than trying to operate this unit.  In addition, it's very difficult to read the numbers on the face unless you pick up the unit and press the light button.

The 10"" strait jaw and long nose pliers have a bit of play, side-to-side, in the jaw and they don't necessarily align perfectly when you close them; there is no play at all when they are closed. I'm not sure this really even matters, but it bothers me. On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever seen long nose locking pliers, old or new, that didn't have a little wobble in the open jaw. All of the curved jaw pliers are fine, so I'm giving them  a four over the two loose jaws."

0,"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and it remains a trifle unconvincing that his 'endeavours were pivotal in the course of history'.  That being said, there are all the usual details - from tragic biographies to prolonged and agonising torture - to keep you turning the pages, and it is certainly interesting to read once again about how horrible those Dutch were to the poor English (as can also be read about in Samurai William). Then, of course, Milton is great at weaving a yarn together, and it is always fascinating to read about the exploits of various larger-than-life adventures; particularly those exploits centred on parts other than the 'spiceries' themselves. The book is a light and enjoyable read, but it is most certainly worth a read. Milton's greatest contribution to history is, I feel, his abilities to take a reader's imagination so convincingly back to a time of pirates and uncharted adventure."

0,"Sadly, I have tried this model again (for the 2nd time) and it still proved problematic for me. As for playing content, I agree it plays a vast number of differing file formats. But for me I encountered too many issues with this model to be a reliable solution or replacement of my older versions.  First, I want to say I own two older models (WDBAAN0000NBK) for several years and love it. My only negative is I am unable to configure them to indicate newly added content (not sure if this is doable).  Last year I tried a refurb version of the WDBYMN0000NBK-HESN and more recently purchased and returned a brand new unit. Both times I experience similar problems. Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.  I really hoped for this newer version to be more satisfying experience than the previous generations but for me that is not the case."

They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.  This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.  A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them. Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.  The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.  A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring."

0,"I loved this book! It's full of adventure and courage with a good deal of history thrown in.  The Siege Winter opens during the brutal civil war between Stephen of Blois and Empress Mathilda, during which the common people suffered terribly from depredations on both sides. A young girl of the fens is brutally attacked and left for dead as she and her sisters flee the soldiers and brigands that prey on the locals.  She is rescued by Gwil and becomes Penda, a young boy. Together Gwil and Penda struggle to survive in the time when ""god and his saints slept"".  The story is recounted by an abbot on his deathbed to a young scribe. The character's are varied: Maud, a young noblewoman who is traded back and forth between the two sides in the war as if she was as much a piece of property as her actual property; William, Maud's stepson who is torn between devotion to his awful father and Maud; King Stephen and Empress Mathilda; and various other players. The action is constant, and is both mental and physical as the characters try to stay alive in the brutal war. And then there is the evil monk...who is he, and why does he have such power?  This is Ariana Franklin's last book; she died before it was completed and her daughter completed it. It's a wonderful book and a great tribute to her. I wish she were still around to write more great books!"
0,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.  Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.  Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."

0,"I bought this hat to wear on a three-day stay at the Western Southern Tennis Tournament in Mason, Ohio.  It performed beautifully through sunny, rainy, and sometimes very windy weather.  Good thing for the chin strap because you would not want the hat to blow off while sitting up high in the stadium seats.  I noticed other tennis enthusiasts had similar OR hats, but I was very pleased with mine and glad I purchased it online.  And it's a good thing the hat can be put into a washing machine because it did get a little dirty after three days of wear.  The best feature of the hat is that the back extends down far enough to cover the neck and keep it from being burned by the sun.  The adjustable chin strap and the toggle at the back allow you to get a fit exactly to your head size that is comfortable and stylish at the same time."

0,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.  First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one: Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.  Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.  The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.  This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.  The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."

0,"This game is a mixture between worker placement and area control.  Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the ""New World"", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.  It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn't really care for that game and I don't like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn't seem as abstract as Dominant Species.  The one slightly original mechanic of this game are the specialist workers that provide bonuses based on what action spaces they are placed in.  I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as ""slightly original"" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.  All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.  The special buildings you could buy didn't do anything very interesting and all of this made the game kind of bland.  The worst was that there was very little to do by the end game, especially the final turn.  It wasn't all bad though.  There are multiple legitimate paths to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make.  It's just not something that has stood the test of time."

0,"There is little doubt that Trevor is a master of his craft and perhaps the  greatest living short story writer in the world today.  After Rain, a  volume of twelve stories, explores such subjects as infidelity,  homosexuality, religious conflicts, and violence.  What makes these stories  so powerful, however, is not the subjects they deal with, but the portrayal  of the characters thoughts, emotions, and responses.  Trevor is able to  examine such human conditions as jealousy, rage, sadness, regret, and hope  in a non-judgmental light that leaves the reader looking into oneself to  gain further insight.  His writing style is nothing short of remarkable.  He is eloquent and simplistic, never revealing more than he should, making  the unspoken a compelling component of his story.  If you have not yet read  Trevor, I urge you to wait no longer.  His literary grace will surely leave  a lasting impact on you as a reader and as a human being."

There are four sets of armies to chose from gold and green are the Alliance of Elves and Men while red and black are the armies of Mordor.

1,Ghost Whisperer is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a strange and bizarre world where the world is very different from the one they grew up in. The story is told in a rather idyllic manner with no strong male characters or overly dramatic action scenes. The ending is rather predictable as the characters are forced to take on new lives and responsibilities and to go through some difficult times. The story is about a father who is lost in a strange land and who is forced to live with his own family and friends.

0,"Adam Schonberg is in medical school and trying to make ends meet without the support of either his or his wife, Jennifer's, parents.  His family was not happy when he married outside the Jewish religion.  Now he finds that their already struggling family of two is about to be a family of three and he doesn't know how to cope or manage financially.  Jennifer will have to quit her job as a dancer and so Adam decides to take a leave of absence from medical school to go work for a drug company.  But all is not what it seems with their fancy corporate headquarters and high dollar paychecks.  Adam soon finds himself in the middle of a corporate plan to take over the field of medicine by drugging and mind controlling as many doctors as the company can get their hands on.  All the while, Adam must deal with the conflict developing between Jennifer and himself because of his suspicions that her OBGYN is drugged as well.  Cook weaves an extremely interesting conspiracy theory about how the business world is beginning to affect medicine and it's treatment, or lack thereof, of patients.  It confronts the  idea that for-profit companies will continue to have an influence on the field of medicine that is not always as positive as these companies would lead you to believe.  The unfortunate aspect of this book was that the story line jumped from idea to idea a bit and often portrays Jennifer in a overly simplistic and patronizing manner.  Just when the adventure really heats up, the story ends abruptly and rather predictably.  A story with a lot of potential ended flat and in disappointment.  Still, one still finishes with the contemplation that Cook intended."

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to change the sizing information, but it's just good enough. I'm very happy with it. I would recommend this collar to anyone with a dog who is a chewer or chewer and/or chewer."

Very slow from the start and cheap animation and poor production value with mediocre acting and boring story .

0,"I have high arches and because of this, initially found that the part of the shoe that goes over the top of my foot close to my ankle is so rigid that they were uncomfortable to wear for more than a little while at a time. Fortunately, since they are leather, the break-in was very brief and they are now extremely comfortable. Additionally, they are great looking and seem to be very high quality--I am confident that they will last.  Also, I think the footbed is very comfortable and they seem to support my high arches just fine. I have both the patent black leather and the blue Cayman style. The blue Cayman is absolutely Exquisite and the color in the picture does not do the shoe Justice. It is a beautiful almost metallic silvery blue and I just love it.  Also be sure you understand the difference between the professional clog and the pro XP mule. I find the pro XP mule to be significantly more comfortable than the regular professional clog and worth the extra money."

The top switch shared a junction box with another 45609 switch which controlled a different circuit.  I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.  I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.  Nothing he nor I did ever resolved this issue, and i eventually had to put the original switch back in.  So please be aware that there are some fringe cases where these switches aren't going to work."

With this, and a Wiremold kit, everything is solid, mostly invisible, and best yet AWAY FROM THE KIDS AND THEIR WIRE-KILLING WAYS!  Be aware that I wouldn't recommend running more than 100W peak over this cable, due to the 18AWG thickness. If your receiver peaks higher than 150W, for safety sake use 14AWG or lower, as thickness increases as the number drops."
0,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.  My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.  This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.  UPDATE I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"

0,"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).  The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.  Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character."

0,"Recently got this as a gift. I really like the Blue color on it. Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode. or tracking a activities. No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it. It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone. Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.  Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.  Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.  sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.  Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10. Most feature work great like viewing data and stuff but usually when hitting back button on certain part of the app it would crash other than that I find this jawbone to fit my daily usage very well."

1,"Do NOT stay at this hotel! A friend and I booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in Chicago. Though it was a bit pricy, we decided on the Knickerbocker because it was in a great location, and the rooms looked large and well-kept. Our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time. However, despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay, when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an HOUR until we were allowed up to our room. The concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us, and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late. To top it off, the maid service was terrible. The only thing they seemed to do was make the bed; no vacuuming, no fresh towels, etc. We didn't want to stay the third night, but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee. This hotel is way too much money for the services they provide, you'd be better off staying in a Motel 6."
1,"This laptop mat, sized for a 9"" laptop, is a perfect fit for my needs. The laptop is small enough to fit a typical desktop, but not large enough to accommodate large laptops. I have been using this laptop for several years now and I always like it. I love it. I love the fact that I can use the laptop with a USB 3. 0 port on the side of the laptop. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's small enough to be easy to carry around, but I'm not sure that I would ever use it with a USB 2. 0 port on the side of the laptop. It's a little difficult to carry around and to carry with the laptop, but I can carry it with the laptop and it's a little easier to carry around. UPDATE:  I received this laptop today and it was very well packaged and was very easy to install. I was able to install a single USB 3. 0 port on the laptop and it was very easy to install. The package was very well organized and was easy to navigate and navigate."

0,"I liked how this story developed.  Rosalie Whitwell just wants a home of her own.  David Linney, Marquess of Deal, has spent his life being alone.  There are two tropes here.  David thinks he should not have children because he will pass a condition that runs in his family.  The other is the marriage of connivence.  Both work well in this story of two people who belong together.  The characters are well developed, the plot moves smoothly and the writing is excellent.  Pick this up for a enjoyable summer time read."

0,My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago. We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel. I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel. Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldn't set up a pack and play for my son. I had to call and 'upgrade' my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep. The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn. The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty. I will NEVER stay there again.

0,"Wow! I really, really liked this book! This is story has one of my favourite themes-romance laced with a bit of humour. The 'blue demon' is such a loveable character and his 'lady' was a great match for him. Another good character was Rierdane, the valet-he reminded me of an English butler. One reviewer mentioned something about the way Cass spoke-yeah, it wasn't my favourite, but she didn't speak like that all the time and it didn't detract from the story, in fact it made me realise that there are all types of dialects and speech patterns* and it has very little to do with how or with whom one falls in love. This is a lovely story, I will definitely look for more of Ms. Story's book (I read her Willing Slave-another excellent story).  *Disclosure-As a British-Nigerian married to a Yank, I think may have some experience with dialects/accents :)"
0,Bought for my 16 year old son who is very picky! He loves them. The strap across the top of the foot has a fabric backing that keeps it from rubbing or scratching like slides with the adjustable Velcro straps. He has a narrow foot and these slides fit him well so I'd buy a size up if you have a an average to wide foot. I expected the slim fit per other reviews and purchased his normal shoe size hoping they would be a hit!  Can't go wrong with an UA gift for boys of all ages!

However the second time I took it through the airport, one of the front hooks came off. Couldnt find it. Turns out that they're not sewn on. Theyre just hooked on with two small hooks.  Im sitting at the airport halfway through my fourth trip and it seems that Ive lost the other one. Too bad.

0,"Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations. I had no idea it would be so large, so nice and with so many amenities. I also didn't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute. We were met at the door by the friendliest staff. Even with a long line at check-in, the entire process was about 10 minutes. We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV, decent size bathroom and comfortable bed. Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant. Paid $200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago. We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale, but we also paid over $300/night there."

I do not think they will be long enough to wear for long periods of time, but I hope they will. I am 5'6"" and the shirt fits perfect. I am wearing a size 12. 5 and it is too big. I would recommend ordering from this site. I'm 5'6"" and 140lbs, and ordered a medium. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. My waist is a 36 and I'm a medium.

1,"I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago. Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 (one!!) front desk agent 30 minutes to process. Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding, it seemed, wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. I was nervous about my own reservation and, sure enough, my Superior Corner room wasn't available. The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. Want internet? Upcharge. Want extra pillows? Upcharge. Extra coffee for the room? Upcharge. Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. I won't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking."

0,"We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. We normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to Soldier's Stadium and the Art Insitiute this time. We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier. What a suite!! It was huge. The basic living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. Up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. All rooms were spotlessly clean. They even smelled good. Lovely soaps, robes, etc. Lots of large closets. The bathrooms were older but well maintained. Much better than the ones at the Four Seasons. The furniture was nice but worn in some spots. The beds and linens were excellent. Room service was fast. The food and service were great. The pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. We had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. Maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. They wouldn't allow me to tip them!! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. This is a very large hotel, so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. Also, the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an 'E'. All in all, the Palmer House is a good value for the money."

0,"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.    Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like."

0,"Don't let the manila fool you, this is a comfortable and soft rope. The braiding is tight and the quality excellent. There is little to no fear that it will fray into your hands, the way some cheap manila ropes will. The 1.5"" diameter is perfect for my children to grip, and is also good for adults. The rubberized coating on the end should last a while if we keep it from dragging all over the ground.  Compared to synthetic/poly climbing ropes bought by some friends (on Amazon), it is much easier to hold and grip. It's not slippery like they are. I think this one is much safer for the little hands.  At the end of the day, it's a rope you toss over a tree limb to climb and swing. But it's more quality than I expected for the price."

0,"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.  bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.  as they say in the brew community, ""Cheers!"""

I can't wait to read the next book in the series. I'm on my way to reading the next book.I read this book in one sitting, and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to read this story. The characters were real, and the story flowed perfectly. I could not put it down, and I loved it! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see what happens next! I highly recommend this book to everyone!This was a great book. I love the fact that the characters were so realistic.

0,"We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel. Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor, but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay. We did - as recommended - have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there. There is no breakfast buffet - you order a la carte. Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet. Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order. We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience. I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel."

0,"You know how good they are. Make sure you have a tool made for crimping these--it will make your connections easier, quicker, and more secure."
0,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.  The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.  The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.  The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.  Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.  They fit well though, and are comfortable.  I wish the material was a little thicker, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and stick with four stars as long as they hold out."
0,Putting on these socks made my feet very happy! Right when I took them out of the package I could feel how soft and well made they were and when I put them on my feet that was immediately confirmed. They are extremely comfortable and the fit is perfect. I always prefer to buy quality socks that come in different sizes. I have somewhat small feet (8 1/2 mens) and those one size fits all socks you get in department stores never fit me right. The heels always seem to ride up the back of my ankle which is very annoying. With these socks the size medium fits and hugs my feet perfectly and the fabric feels great against my skin. I have no doubt that anyone else who tries these socks on will love them as much as I do! I was very lucky to receive these great socks at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
0,"This book really is a classic. It's interesting from start to finish. Yes, it's a feel-good story, a lesson in tolerance, and may even be a girl's book, but I liked it - a lot! I'm not a touchy-feely or artsy sort of guy. I've found that most ""classics"" are a fraud - The Great Gatsby comes to mind.  I highly recommend it.  After you've read Mockingbird, read Go Set a Watchman.  If you know Miss Lee, tell her to get back to work!"

0,"Just returned from the James Hotel after staying at the Park Hyatt. I have stayed at most Chicago Hotels: Pennisula, Four Seasons, The Ritz, Fairmont etc. Had heard a little about the James and the Primehouse at the James. We paid MORE for the room at the James then at any of the above mentioned hotels. What a disappoitment! The room we stayed in had 2 double beds. The toilet broke and overflowed, the tub didnt drain while showering and the HUGE bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times. The closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all. The room was very small and non descript. Much like staying at an IKEA but without the color. Windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small. The staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly. The room had a huge 52' plasma TV that was nice. There is NO way this hotel is 4 star yet. The room rate close to $500.00 a night was WAY of of line. We paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels. The rate should have been about half of that."

It's a good book, and one I would recommend to anyone.  I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love reading about the lives of the young women who were on the train with a group of boys.  They were all so young and the trains were too small to handle.  I was just so excited to read about them.  I really enjoyed the story and the characters.  It was a fun ride.I have read this book numerous times and loved it.  It is an entertaining read and I was able to find some of the language in the book and I learned a lot about the people.  I enjoyed the story a lot and I thought it was good.  I really enjoyed the characters and the story was good.  I was very disappointed with the ending of the book.

To think that something like this could happen in America is really disturbing.

A fast pace, strong protagonist and a slew (yes, slew) of friends and coconspirators combine with intelligent but not boring language make for a great weekend or vacation read."
0,"Super cute, made well, fits great!  My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs. I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.  My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.  I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.  The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom. The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up. The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.  We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back). The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.  I returned the size 2T, which also could have worked nicely, they were not too big and she may have grown into them, but I liked the fit of the 18 month suit a little better."

0,excellent reading  and story.  Could not put the book down.
0,"Nobody's Fault was very well written and the author uses descriptions and dialogue with expertise and care. The story itself was told well and the loose ends tied together nicely in the end. The author wove multiple points of view from different perspectives about the same incidents and gave us a clear picture of what each character felt and saw and why. Despite all that, I still came away from Nobody's Fault feeling sad and more than a little ticked off. The title is wrong... it was clearly the husband/father's fault. ALL OF IT WAS - any man that walks away from his marriage and children to live with another woman so he can be ""fulfilled"" with ""true love"" is  a sleazeball. When those kids are grown and gone you can find your own freedom and a new life if that's what you need to. But to walk away from your wife, leave your children to live in a single parent home for your own emotional needs? Selfish beyond description. As for the feelings of his new love, the other woman? I had no sympathy for her in any shape or form - so she fell in love, so what? She knew he was married and she trespassed anyway. None the less, I will read other work by this author on a different subject matter, she definately knows how to tell a story."

0,"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg. In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it. So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.  Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker. And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel. Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot. Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.  > This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick. The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.  > About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory. While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.  > And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.  > Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven. Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well. In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.  Made in Italy (We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)  Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant. 10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true) 18/10 stainless steel PFOA free ---------------------  No grease. Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards. Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking. Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done. Lifted egg out, pan was clean."

0,"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.  Fortunately ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" has been restored and is now available so it can become the classic it deserves to be."

I highly recommend this teepee, especially for the price! I wouldn't bother with the more expensive ones because they are only larger (and this ones large!).

The size 9 is very comfortable for me. The only thing I would change is the sizing. I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, so I ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly. The material is soft and a good quality. The material is very soft and comfy, so I will buy another pair for my daughter. I'm 5'9"" and 110lbs, so I ordered a size 6."

As most of you know, a lot of USB devices don't come with a USB cable. The same thing applied when I purchased my new printer.  The clerk who sold me the printer suggested I purchase a USB cable along with my printer ... the asking price: $29.95 for a 8 foot long cable.  I told him ""NO"".  Then purchased this cable on Amazon for $10.95 which included shipping.  The only thing that got to me about this deal was that the shipping cost more than I paid for the USB cable.  Oh well!  I bought some sushi with the 19 bucks that I saved!"

0,"Christmas at Waratah Bay is a wonderful beautifully written holiday story. I loved the Australian setting as the background, feeling as if I was flying back with Sarah to spend one last Christmas there with Grandfather figure, Harold. Much to admire about Sarah, though maybe not her cooking skills, which last there of only served to make her more endearing. Her true strength of character shows through as she tries her best for Harold and then Max. Speaking of which, Max is a true friend to Harold but hard to like at first.  It is the differences in the characters with the wariness that acts as a catalyst that leads to their dealing with past issues in their lives. Love and family is always worth the work as Sarah and Max discover. Of course, a little Christmas magic never hurts either. A valuable lesson to be learned. Delightful read. One of my favorites of this series.  NetGalley provided a copy."

However, the three light wings on the sides are adjustable, and provide an excellent area light suitable for camping or working on my vehicle after dark.  I think we will carry this in out RV.  By the way, I spent ten minutes rapidly switching both switches in an attempt to duplicate the lock up problem others have reported, but it worked perfectly.

1,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in the World"" is a documentary about a hotel that was built by the owner of the Marigold Hotel.  The hotel was built in the late 19th century and was owned by the wealthy Charles LeBarre.  This is a wonderful story about the true story of the hotel owner and his wife, the owner of the Marigold Hotel.  It is a very entertaining documentary that gives a strong picture of the hotel owner's life and how he managed to survive his gambling addiction.  The documentary does a great job of giving us a glimpse into his life, and the real life that he was in his 30's.  It is a wonderful story of the hotel owner and his wife.I loved this movie. It was a good movie and I was impressed with the story. It was not the best of the bunch. I think the ending was a little hard to follow.This is a movie that is good for kids.

0,I think the relationship should of been built up more between MJ and Noah. It seems they just jumped right into it. One minute he was thinking about killing here and the next she's getting oral sex on the beach. It moved to fast. The whole Aristotle part in the book was od creepy. Didn't understand it. Neither the gypsies part. I would say it gave the book another dimension to it. It was not just about gangs and stuff. Was it needed? To me no. The book started off great and it was funny and kept the reader entertained. But towards the middle it started to get weird. I'm like it's it a dark book or a paranormal book. Not my favorite by Kenya.

We were not offered anything to do, drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished. The clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone! How rude! We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done. And after waiting that long for the room, can you believe it? There was a dirty towel in the bathroom. The television didn't work, we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it. Plus, the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair. I'm so mad I'm writing the owners and letting them know! This really made me mad. We haven't taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs. Even the concierge snickered at my boots, so what, I like to wear Doc Martens! It makes me mad even thinking about the Fairmont. At least my time in Chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame."

After a lot of research, I decided to give this a try. The Starrett is very compact and gives you the ability to hang your electrical devices on the wall, which is great for storing them in your pocket. The magnetic element has a very good feel to it and the design allows you to hang your device on the wall to protect it from the elements. The black felt pad is also very well made and the holder is super heavy and sturdy. The handle is very secure and the included charger is included. The charger is very easy to use and I don't have to worry about batteries. It's also a very nice feature that you can put the charger on the wall with one hand. You can also put it on the floor and hold it on the floor for a longer time. The charger has a very nice feel and is very well made.  The price was right and I'm very happy with it.

1,"I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased. The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern, stylish rooms. The rooms are something truly special with huge, soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt. The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub. If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32' LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. When you finally make it out of your room, down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant. It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques. Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile. A full dinner including appetizer, main course, and dessert can be had for $45, amazing. If you are looking for a modern, urban, chic hotel in Chicago then look no further, the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice."

0,"I download a lot of books but rarely read them all the way through.  This was different -- I enjoyed learning more about the gaming world, there was romance and a good plot, and enough sex for those who want it.  It was very much Fifty Shades of Grey in the gaming world, and parts were a little like Pretty Woman, but both with a more independent and intelligent heroine.  The only distractions were that the entire book needs an editor to proofread it, and maybe a little too much detail about what the main characters were wearing.  Oh, and the techie terms and name pronunciations should have been up front or referenced at the beginning.  Looking forward to reading more from this author!"

0,"Every review I've read has been quasi-negative but not being one to listen to critics, I took a chance.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Depending on why you go to a movie, you may not like this because it is not escapism.  It deals with real life issues and things most of us can relate to.  I found the movie to be very refreshing and all the characters real to life.  The main character is a single mom trying to raise a precocious son.  She has to deal with a dead-end relationship and an aging father, an irresponsible sister and a job she hates.  How she copes and what she does is more believable than most of the ""chick flick"" films out today.  I think this is one of the better movies in a sea of fluff to spend time and money on.  Amy Adams is wonderful and it is always refreshing to see Alan Arkin.  Please don't dismiss this film because of iffy reviews.  It is worth going to see."

1,"For the price, you would think this would be a top quality hotel, but it was nowhere close. Service at check-in was slow and unfriendly. The room was even worse. It was small, dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though I had requested a non-smoking room. The cover on the bed was stained, there was hair all over the bathroom floor, and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall. Everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel. I also didn't appreciate having to pay for wifi, when other premium hotels offer it for free. Overall, this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time, and considering the price, it was terrible."

I have a 4 month old lab and he's 8 lbs and this is a perfect size for him.

It simply seems to me that given that the author admits to having made up stories about Simpson in the past, the credibility of this interview is questionable. The book is well written, and for that , I'll give it 3 stars. I'm sorry I couldn't give it more, and I don't necessarily believe that Simpson is innocent. I simply question the veracity of the story based on information given by the author himself. Ultimately, I can neither encourage nor discourage the reader. It's simply a book you'll have to read for yourself and form your own opinions of."
0,"I have used this for fine cracks in my drive way for about 5 years.  Some cracks take multiple fillings to finally fill the crack.  It sticks to the concrete and holds it together keeping it from spreading out.  One of the really important functions is to seal the crack so that water can not get down to undermine the concrete or to fill the crack in the winter, freeze and spread the concrete apart.  It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.  It works wonderfully like nothing I have ever seen before and I have owned homes for 49 years."

What's more scary then the movie is the people who gave this film 5 stars. 48% of 50 some reviews gave it 5 stars?!? How is that even possible that at least 25 people on this planet, and I know there are more, think this is as good as such horror films that generally get 5 stars from fans and critics like Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St, The Exorcist ect... Obviously there is a second edit of this movie floating around that I'm not privy to. A edit that incorporates everything that makes a 5 star horror film. Gore, suspense, good acting ect.....

0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this LED CRLight 4W Dimmable LED Filament Candle Light Bulb,2700K Warm White 400LM, E12 Candelabra Base Lamp C35 Bullet Top, Clear Glass Cover, 40W Incandescent Replacement light!  This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.  I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.  I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills! I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review/opinion."

No. While it may be true we can't actually review the dvds themselves (yet), most of us have already seen all of Seasons 1 and 2 and can fully justify our opinions of the show. In a word; brilliant. I applaud the cast and crew for not making this a ""Terminator of the week"" show or catering to the MTV crowd with ""whoohoo, more 'splosions!"" Yes, it is about killer robots from the future. But, it is also about the people fighting them. More so. I hope that WB and Fox continue to make it.

0,"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked. Excellent product, don't tear the transmitting wire out!"

0,"Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.  If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.  I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.  We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.  So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.  I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.  Now that the price has gone up  I should've went for a long swim that night."
0,"Plot - Rotten Tomatoes A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.  Review - 2/5 When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;)."

My glasses case seemed to be too thick and it made the bag look warped for a few days. Closing the magnet at the top helped that issue.  My main annoyance is that the outside is showing wear after only a month.  It has scratches form spots I can not explain.

I really enjoyed this story.  Even though some of the events in the plot may seem familiar to those who like romance/fantasy, Anne did a good job creating a fresh take on those events with her original heroine.

Because they work and sound so good I will live with .250.  Picture the set on a head. There is a very sharp teat on the top left side of the black plastic piece that slides down. I was able to remove them (on both sides) with no problem but it is sharp enough to scratch a small finger."
0,Easy to run from the tailgate of a Jeep Wrangler. True you have to solder the end but it was super easy with a solder iron. It's actually a good thing because with out the connector installed its much easier to run the cable through tight spots. The instructions stink so check our firestik.com for more detailed instructions. Nice clean finish and final results yielded perfect SWR readings.

0,"I bought this for my wife. She hates learning new electronics and is quite picky about things like this. She loves it! First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately. So far my wife and I have been very impressed with it and she does not miss her favorite watch it replaced."

0,"I like Amazon/Warrior Women stories a lot. There doesn't need to be much plot to them for me to devour them. Having said that, and the fact that it was awhile ago that I read this, I really enjoyed the story. I had read some reviews voicing concerns about events taking place in the book, but considering the time these events took place (alternate reality, as it were,) this didn't bother me. I'm just reviewing this now, because I still remember things in the story; it's thread still excites me. I have it in my ""to read again pile,"" which says a lot. I will also say that even though this is a Book One in a trilogy, this book stands on its own nicely. In fact, I really have no desire to finished this trilogy. I previewed the other two books and they don't hook me like this first book did. Unlike other trilogies I've read, there is no cliffhanger, that I recall. Overall, a rather enjoyable, (albeit long,) story. I don't normally read nearly 600 page stories. Aside: I don't care one whit about this author's gender issues. misrepresentations or not. We all have our gender discoveries to make, many take a lifetime to resolve. Far be it from me to judge from afar without walking in someone else's shoes. I buy books that I like for content. I don't care if it's a ghostwriter, a straight man writing as a lesbian, a f2m, m2f, transgender. Or any other gender I missed. Reviews should be about books, and author's style; they should not be direct attacks on said author's person. And full disclosure: I was born a woman; and, yes, I am a lesbian. I do not read most books mainly for the sexy bits. I absolutely believe you can be straight and write good gay/lesbian dialog. Love and emotions are universal."

Great quality!  The only reason I gave this a 5 stars is because I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is definitely one of the best in the series. The size is perfect and the quality is good. I love that it is a game that is very similar to the original Tootlemania. I will say that I will probably not buy this again for any reason because it is so very similar to the original. I would recommend this game to anyone. I love these for our little ones!  We have been playing with them for a few months now and it is still great!  We love the colors and the size and the size of the game pieces. They are perfect for our little ones. They are a little hard to pull off the wooden board but they are very well made and they are very well made."
1,"The Palmer House Hilton is an incredible break from the real world. The lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel, and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks. The lobby is luxe and gilded, with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly, accommodating employees. The rooms are plush, with each bed furnished with a Serenity Dreams topper for extra comfort. The room decor is modern and sleek, a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels. For your convenience, there's a fully-stocked business center, pool, fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo, business or family traveller."

0,"OK, we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating. I can't believe the bad reviews. I got a priceline deal, and I still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (OK a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. Here it is from my point of view. Both rooms on 10th floor. Regarding the size of the rooms. We had two rooms. One was a 2 double bed room. It was about 20' x 15'. Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. The furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. Three separate levels (TV, ice/coffee, and minibar) The other room was called 'Queen executive'. This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two TVs and terry bathrobes. Also about the same size but different configerations. One TV faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. Smoke in the lobby. There is a bar to the right of the entrance. It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. Cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint. Concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does. Was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? Either case, not good. He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect."
1,"Terrible time at The Talbott. When I planned my vacation to Chicago I called ahead and made reservations to stay here. When I went to check in I was told I didn't have a reservation, knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working. Finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. Thankfully they knew how to use the computer. I go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. I could not believe it when I complained, I was told to spray some air freshener. I had to go visit family. When I got back my room key did not work. Once again there I was complaining to the helpless employee. He told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. I could not believe the mentality of this guy. I had one more night reserved, I could not take it anymore and I went and spent the rest of my vacation at my Aunts house. I would not recommend The Talbott to anyone."

0,"""Northanger Abbey"" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance.  But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality.  The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story.  That fiction is just that.  Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends.  She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home -  Northanger Abbey.  Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance).  The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite.  They are wealthy ""English Christians.""  There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners.  Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.  I would recommend this novel."
1,"Our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and, instead of helping, a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us. They had trouble locating our reservation. Our room was tiny! When I'm paying over $400 a night for a room, I expect to be able to walk around in it! The beds were also tiny. The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door. This hotel was probably once beautiful and classy, but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs. Won't be staying here again."

0,"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.  Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.  What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.  Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.  In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands."
0,It does what it is supposed to do. I am a little concerned in the packaging of the product as it appeared to have been opened. There were the included cables still in plastic so I am not sure if this was box was just opened or it was a used product repackaged. The only other issue is that the polarized plugs really were difficult to plug in. I had to use the blade of a screwdriver to get them all the way flush into the surge protector on the standard size outlet side. No issues on the large outlets for the power adapters.

0,"This board is perfect for quick games as well as teaching beginners. The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance).  The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.  Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!)  Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc."
0,"I stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dusty/dirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200,000 of my closest friends. I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night. The second night, the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo. I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately. I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap (hand soap) for the bath/shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place, nicely displayed, but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 1/8 full. Yeah!! The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave....I'll grant them that....but that's where their 'pros' end. I'd rather stay at a Hampton Inn. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."

0,"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.  Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)  The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.  The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.  Go back and read the first three or four in the series, especially before Qwill moved to Pickax. They were certainly light reading, but the plots were intriguing, the writing was tighter and the books then deserved their Best Seller status."

0,"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right? So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time? I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!  I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it."

0,"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.  For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.  Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.  In short, RIVER MONSTERS is an appealing, exciting and insightful guide to aquatic wonders that - may still - lurk in freshwater rivers. Recommended."

0,"Joyce's ""Dubliners"" is a collection of fifteen short stories that present snapshots of the lives of common people in  Dublin around the beginning of the 20th Century.  The stories are subtle commentaries about  Irish attitudes towards nationalism, religion, morality, life, and death.  Each explores a distinctive, dramatic theme, such as sexual perversion  (""An Encounter""), infatuation (""Araby""), the  frustration of personal unfulfillment (""A Little Cloud"" and  ""Counterparts""), self-imposed loneliness (""A Painful  Case""), hubris (""A Mother""), and Catholic/Protestant  conflict (""Grace"").  Overtones of Irish nationalism, remembrance,  and piety permeate all the stories. The stories are neither  depressing nor uplifting, but rather  open-ended in their denouement; no  conflicts are resolved and no moral conclusions are reached.  Joyce depicts  the characters and scenes so sympathetically that the reader understands  clearly why the dejected boy in ""Araby"" leaves the bazaar feeling  like  ""a creature driven and derided by vanity"" and the events  that drive Farrington to beat his young son at the end of  ""Counterparts.""  And why, in ""The Dead,"" Gabriel, after  giving a dinner speech in which he makes respectful reference to the dead,  feels his dignity knocked down a notch when his wife reveals to him the  tragic fate of her past love. After nearly a century,  ""Dubliners"" remains one of the best  crystallizations of humanity  bestowed upon the world."

It holds the attention as Ellie struggles with dealing with her classmates to her discovering a new world and struggling to find her place within the new community as well to discovering who she is and growing as a character.  And it even follows the girl she got mistaken for as she also tries to fit in with a different environment. I especially loved Ellie's brother Paul and loved their relationship, even though it was a minor detail in the story. In all, Amber Rain is a fun dystopian experience that reinvents the world with new threats and different ways of living and the task of surviving."

Ripped it out and installed this one, in the master bedroom.  Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.  Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.  Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip.

It was a great plot, great couple but she seemed to spend way too much time on background information and not enough on the characters falling in love or even interacting together. They seemed to only speak twice and the love affair wasn't developed. When they first hooked up romantically I looked down and half the book was already read. I like great dialogue that shows a connection between couples and LMR has ALWAYS delivered. I hope that now that she used 3/4 of this book to set up the plot the next two books will focus on the couples interacting together too."

0,"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.  As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.  So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.  So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series."

I contacted Amazon to verify that they were doing the right thing and they sent me a new one. I'm going to order another one, which I will try to return. I've found that Amazon is a good customer service company and they do a great job on their products. I would definitely recommend this tool to anyone. They work great. I've had no problems with them.

False advertisement. http://www. hippressurecooking. com/consumer-alert-no-pressure-canning-in-un-tested-multi-cookers/ That being said, I like this appliance for what it is, an electric pressure cooker. I found myself like most folks on here, not sure of how to use it, as the 'cookbook' that came with it was pretty much just a few recipes. I did find a wonderful pressure cooker cookbook here on Amazon, and I would suggest you purchase something along these lines. This author has been using electric pressure cooking for years, and her book is full of helpful hints, and tons of recipes. I have found it to be invaluable. Just even in the rice section. I was at a loss with the instructions that came with, but in this book, it's all perfectly laid out. The book is available here on Amazon 'hip pressure cooking'. If you are wanting to get the most use out of your newly purchased appliance, you would do yourself a favor and pick up something similar to this book to go along with it. http://www. amazon."
0,"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.  Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.  That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.  Finally, the steam valve inexplicably shattered one day, and judging from the other reviews here, this is not an uncommon occurrence."

The cast was perfect and kept largely to the novel.  Lana Turner, Donna Reed, Edmund Gwen were perfect in their roles.  For its time this movie was far ahead with the special effects and photography.  I recommend this film to those who still believe of the courage of youth and the joy of reconciliation as older people.  I just can't recommend this film enough."

The negatives about this hotel is that you have to pay extra to use the fitness centre and internet access. Also, parking is high ($45 valet/day).

That cause a problem: when I plug it in to a panel with two outlets, the other outlet is barely accessable.  I also bought the other repeater TP-LINK TL-WR700N. The TP-link is better. It supports hidden root SSID and it doesn't add a dup. Its plug is on the side so it works well with the plug in the other outlet."
0,"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.  To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.  The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.  All in all it's a fun little game for the very youngest of gamers at a cheap price."

It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.  I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.  Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.  What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?  ....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.  That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with what is coming next....no, you haven't!!  I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)  From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.  I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.  I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.  The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!  Bring on the next enstallment!"

0,"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!"

Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.  The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.  Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?  Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.  Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories. Received an ARC from Tule Publishing via NetGalley for an honest review"

0,"What makes the main character of PENA SPRING by J.P.

As the book progresses, Cheryl and her ever increasing ""family"" must cope with the the effects of a superflu and the subsequent collapse of society.

It is very easy to put together, except the knobs stink, they were very hard to screw in and very cheap like everyone else commented. My biggest problem is it wasn't very deep, so if you are like me and passed up reading the measurements then this might be good knowing. I had bought mine to put towels in but it cannot fit them, so now I store toilet paper in it. Anyhow, other than that it looks nice fully functional other then it needing additional shelving inside :)"

1,My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back. The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either. When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key. When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made. The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food. We ended up going home two days before we planned.
0,"This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.  It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.  The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.  The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned. All in all I'm pleased, other than the fact that my Earth Brown turned out to be Dark Brown, a color not even listed as an option by Amazon. The tag says ""Earth Brown"" but is not the color shown on the ordering page.  I won't knock it a star for that though I'd rather have the Earth Brown I ordered, or at least something that resembles Earth Brown more than a bar of chocolate."
0,"Please visit my blog for more reviews! :) [...]  Delirium was a delightful read! I had just finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and so Delirium was a great book to read while I was in that ""Dystopian"" book phase (which I still am). Delirium is set in a Dystopian future where their society believes that love is a disease that people can be cured of at the age of 18. Lena has just a little over three months before she turns 18, but she falls in love. She meets a boy named Alex who woos her, they fall in love, and then it kind of has a twist at the end... one that makes you go... ""Wait! WHAT!?! WHY!?""  What I liked I really liked Lauren Oliver's style of writing. The plot never seemed choppy, it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter which is always a plus. The plot is kind of original and I say ""kind of"" because it is a Dystopian novel and these kinds of novels always have something outlawed, or forbidden. The forbidden thing in this novel would be the feeling of love. This means that you are matched with some one who you don't love, and you will never love. They will be your roommate who sleeps in the same bed with you. When you have kids you will only be watching and taking care of them out of duty, not out of love.  What I didn't like Nothing. I really, really liked this book.  How did I read this book I read this book on my nook, but it is one of those books that I want to have in paper form as well."

Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.  She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.  It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!)."

0,"The transmitter works as advertised.  It has two power levels, and switching between them is a bit finicky (you need to read the instructions).  The low power level is useless for transmitting more than a few feet.  The high power level gives a pretty nice signal through my whole house and garage.  I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.  If you want to transmit to a stationary receiver (or maybe a higher-quality portable receiver), it should be fine."

0,"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).  Pros: - John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy. - The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done. - John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check. - Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head. - The first rule of Fight Club is... - John's family is known for rescuing virgins. - Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".  Cons: - Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James."
1,"I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in Chicago for 3 nights. I must say, I was NOT impressed. This is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. To start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. It had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and I guess was supposed to give an air of style. The room was ok I suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price I paid for it. The hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing French cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. My final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. It is simply not worth it."

The story seems formulaic, safe - the sad stories of several women who meet at a knitting circle. The sadness is brought out pretty well, especially initially about the main character Mary's loss. But too much of sadness going on and on works against the story, I feel, so I began to ignore the emotional meanings and look for the story.  I tried to keep at it, but I gave up halfway, which is rare for me to do. I actually skipped the stories of two of the women - you know they are coming, and you don't care about any of them so why should you be forced to read what sad things they went through? Disappointing book."

I can not stress enough how much time this prep station saves me. Doing all 4 steps in a second or two means i do 1k round runs instead of 200 round runs in the same time. If i ever grow two more arms i will buy a second one. Would recommend to anyone."

1,"Though a ""True Blood"" fan, I have read the first three books in the series, and this one is a keeper. The second book is also a must-read. I enjoyed this book, and look forward to the next book. This is a very good book. The authors have a very good idea of the world and the people. They are very well written. I just wish there was more to the story. It was interesting to see how the story went from one country to another. The author kept me interested until the end, but I was a little disappointed. It is definitely a book that you should read. This is a very good book. I like the fact that I don't have to deal with the emotional side of the story. It has a good story, but I have to deal with the book. I liked the way the characters were portrayed. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys story telling. I'm a big fan of the YA books and this book made me feel like I was there. The characters were very believable, the story line was well written and very well developed. The ending was disappointing and the ending was not a good one."
1,Watch this and try not to laugh at the movie. I saw it for the first time last night.
1,"The third book in the series has the characters and their story woven together, and I was just blown away by how the story unfolds. I can't wait to read the next one!Wow! This is one of those books I can't wait for the next one to come out! I love a book that starts with the most emotional, and heartbreaking, moments. I've read all of the books in the series and I can't wait to see what happens next! I love how this book is different from the other books, but I really loved the characters. I love the way the author has told the story. I love how the characters are in the same world, and how they work together to solve the problems in the world. It's amazing how the author keeps us guessing and wondering what happens next! I can't wait"

0,"Maybe if I had standard size carbon arrows this might work. However, I use Easton Gamegetter XX75's, a large diameter shaft (0.036in according to my digital caliper). This says it can go up to 0.3in, however, I disagree. I wish I had posted a picture to go along with this but I do not. The sticky rubber holders were stretched too much that it made it really difficult to get the arrows secure. But the main problem was that the rubber would actually push a couple, not all, of the arrows out after a short period of time (~1-3 minutes). This would result in lost arrows while hunting. I had to return this. Still looking for a replacement....  Overall quality, I like it. Seems to be a good quality Limbsaver quiver. Never got around to mounting it since it would not hold my arrows. Would probably would fine for toothpick arrows ;)"
0,"Quite beautiful! I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch. Public education has not failed us completely."
0,"I would have bought two if they weren't almost $30 a piece. They are nice to have in the office when I sit in front of a computer all day.  Two side notes:  1) Make sure you look around for a water bottle that is closer to the length of the ""wick"". A normal .9fl oz (500ml) bottle is too tall for the wick to reach the bottom or at least closer to it so you have to fill the bottle up before it gets to  3/4 of the way empty.  2) If you don't use it everyday or even occasionally just from going home from work and coming back, the silver piece (metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency) at the top of the humidifier gets ""stuck"" and I have to kind of poke at it to get it running or shake the bottle up.  It kind of freaks me out that its broken but it starts right up after doing that. Not a big deal as long as it always works!"

0,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:  1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.  2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.  3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.  4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.  5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?"

0,"LOL! Amazon asked ""how it fit"" before I could leave a review XD ""Ummm... it was too large. The can did not fit in my shoe :| "" Idk why but I laughed like an idiot at that for way too long.  Anyway I like this stuff. It's not the best one I've used, it doesn't smell great like the others but it does help to remove the odor... fooor a few days. Yeah it doesn't seem to last super long. It's mostly my hiking boots and workout shoes that start to smell a little.  The powder options last much longer for keeping the smell away but they're just so messy. I end up getting powder all over my house from when I take off my shoes and walk around in my socks. This one, I don't have to deal with that. So to me, that's an ok trade. I'm still on my first can of this stuff and I've had it for a while so it DOES still last a while."
0,"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining. First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN: --  its heavy --  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy. -- battery charge didn't last long. Second, when it didn't run: -- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.  In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.  So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?  The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems. The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart. She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it. I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.  Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.  Dang, hate wasting money."
1,"In 2006, Grigory Perelman proved that an academic with a PhD in history could make a difference in the lives of two people. The book, ""A History of the United States"", is a great book. It covers the history of the United States from the American Revolution to the present day. In the book, Perelman provides us with a list of the major events that shaped the nation. He discusses the role of the American Revolution and the role of the white slave trade in the growth of the country. He also discusses the history of the American Revolution and the role of the slave trade in the development of American capitalism. As a historian, I can only recommend this book to those interested in history and the politics of the time. It is a great book to read for anyone interested in the history of the United States. This is a great book. It is a good read, but not one that is easy to read. It is very hard to follow, but it is a very informative and informative book. The story is very well written. The characters are well developed and the plot is very well told. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of the United States. I was excited to read this book, which is a great read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction. The ending was a little bittersweet, but I found it to be a nice ending. I am not a historical fiction person, but this book is a great historical fiction. I think it's one of the best novels that I've read in a long time. It's not the best historical fiction, but it is a good read nonetheless."

The only thing I can say is that if you are looking for a quality speaker, look no further. I am very pleased with the sound quality and the build quality. I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony A-100 on Amazon for $250. 00. It works perfectly and seems to last for quite a while. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade their old Sony A-100 to a better product. I have a Sony A-100 in my home that does not have a built in speaker that I use for sound. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a better product. I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery. I have a 10 year old Sony A-100 and have had no problems with the batteries. I have used this product for a few months and am very happy with the results. The rechargeable battery is easy to use, it has a built in charger, and it has a strong sound."

0,"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.  Pros:  * Image Quality * Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays) * Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%) * The user manual is decent, though not stellar. * Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good. * Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).  Cons:  * Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help. * Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel. * Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus. * Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.  Conclusion: I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.  BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.  If you care:  You can see my photos with this camera on Flickr at: [...]  I ordered the body w/o the kit lens, and instead got the Canon 17-40mm L zoom and the Canon 70-300mm IS zoom.

I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow.

I wanted something loose-ish to sleep in, bought lgt gray, not usually forgiving color. I thought these not only fit perfect but also look cute enough to wear out. They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.  I could have even gone small, so for skinny people these could be too loose. I was pleasantly  surprised w pant and It's a forgiving style. Of course this is just my opinion everyone has different shapes. Hope this helps   REVISION;  Ok have to revise my feedback. I washed these pants, shrank 1full size, no longer forgiving color , no longer cute. They didn't soften up in wash, they were stiff, but I thought they pressed them. They are 90%cotton. These pants are now just OK , I'll wear 4 sleeping only but nt even soft. Price is inexpensive and I if ur thin lighter colors should look fine. Any extra curve  recommend darker color and order up. They will shrink. I wear a 6 ladies and 9 juniors . Hope this was helpful. Of course this is just my experience"
0,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,  PROS: - Great value for the quality - Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes - For the most part, good quality - PRIME shipping!  CONS: - Hooks aren't straight - Several hangers broke straight out the package - Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky  Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be ordering more!"

0,"This series of books by ""Lemony Snicket"" does not have the standard ""happy ending"" of most children's books. The 3 kids in the stories (newly orphaned) have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another. To make matters worse, their ""uncle"" - bad guy Count Olaf - wants their money and is always after them.  He and his evil minions are forever plaguing the lives of the Baudelaire children and cause constant mayhem.  Because of all this misery, I thought my 8-year-old son wouldn't like them - wrong! He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter! The writing is dry, but funny with loads of humor (much is directed to adults). The books contain many ""large"" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text (which can get annoying). I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 14 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats). As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!  The story is definitely moving along toward conclusion and we should have all the answers by book 13 (very appropriate!).  Readers will enjoy the series more if they are able to read the books in order as they build on each other - so this collection will be perfect for those new to the series - and the price is super."

Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.  Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.  It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/old-fashioned-locking-diary/dp/B00NYAGMQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">old-fashioned locking diary</a>&nbsp;may be a better bet.  For the gadget girl who likes to fiddle with tech this is a fun toy, complete with invisible(-ish) ink, a ""hidden"" (in the most obvious way) compartment, and the namesake verbal password.  The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.  Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-)."

She is still struggling with the loss of her son. This book is a great read for young people.I loved this book!  I can't wait to read the next one!I received a free copy of this book from the author for my honest review.  This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a different take on the characters of the first book. I was very curious about this book, and it has it all. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.  The story is well-written, and the characters are well-developed. I enjoyed the story a lot. I thought the author did a good job of setting the mood of the characters and the story. I was very pleased with the way the author handled the emotions of the characters. I'm very pleased to see that the author added a couple of new characters to the story.  The story was very well-written, and the story was very realistic. I loved that the author"

1,"This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago. It is ideal for the corporate executive. Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean. The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience. While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city, which is picturesque especially at night, when the city lights come on. The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area. I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive!"
0,"Herding dogs often love to push balls around with their noses, which helps satisfy their herding instinct if you don't have sheep. The ball needs to be too big for them to fit into their mouths, otherwise they might just pick it up instead of pushing it around, which isn't much fun.  Our Border Collie/ Australian Shepherd mix expends tons of energy running around pushing it all around the yard like crazy, frequently changing directions. Some days it is actually her primary form of exercise, she loves it so much.  It's a bit too big and hard for her to bite into, which is a good trait for a herding ball. Larger dogs could probably manage to bite into it."
1,"The Gourmia Sous Vide Pod (Cordless) is a great product for the price.  It is so easy to use and the attachments are easy to install.  The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small.  This is a problem for most people.  I would have liked the lid to be longer but the lid is a little longer than I wanted.  This is not a big deal for me but I like that the lid is longer than I thought it would be.  The smaller lid does not fit my hand well.  This is a huge plus for me.  I do not have to worry about my hand getting sore because I just put it on and it works great.I bought these to make my sandwich sandwiches for my family.  They are so easy to clean.  I was very happy with the results.  I love the color and the perfect size for sandwiches.These are great.  They are not as thick as they are made out of.  They are very soft and absorbent.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a very strong, lightweight, and durable set of cookware.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my little old refrigerator and when I saw this one I thought it was a perfect gift.  I think I will order it again.It looks great and is perfect for my new kitchen.  It is great for storing spices, spices, etc.  I put them in the freezer for a couple of hours and they hold up great."

The previous one I had picked up all of our hair and it worked well so I knew how much hair comes off our heads in just a few days. With this catcher, it might catch 4-5 hair stands in a few days.

0,"The hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night. For THREE consecutive nights. There was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street (OK - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor). I hesitate to write this review but I rely on Trip Advisor reviews when traveling, and had I been warned about the ambulance sirens, I would have chosen to stay elsewhere. If you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value. Conveniently located. Wonderful staff. But quiet is a key priority for me so I would not stay here again. :("
0,"I have been through FOUR bike lights and this is by far the best one, way way better than the others. I got this for my girlfriends scooter and it fits very nicely, it has on a standard type bicycle bars. The other lights even claimed to have 'more' power and were not even near as bright as this. The others were cheaply made too. Very impressed with this. This light is a very bright light, not dim or dull. Good for safety or for night riding which I like. I feel much more safe with this light. It charges quickly and installation was super simple. This is water resistant as it claims for I took it through a torrential downpour that completely soaked me from head to toe. This light lasts very long, it says on the box for 3 hours and I have definitely had it on for that amount of time no problem. This is a well made quality product. I couldn't be more pleased with this I just had to write a positive review! Hope this helps you as it did me for there are a lot of lights out there and don't do as they claim. This is the real deal, I enjoyed riding on a dark night with a fully lit road! Although I received this at a discount rate, it was only in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and I have no problem paying full price for my other scooter and bicycle."

0,"First let me say, the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what I'd hoped. There are some other problems; the furnishings are quite rundown, and housekeeping wasn't very helpful. We booked a suite and the sofa bed, chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use. I've attached pictures, so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows. Comfortable it was not! The chair bottom is all broken down too. I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture, and a slight adjustment was made in our rate. As to housekeeping, we had ordered an in-room coffee service (which Kimpton's web site says is there, but you have to specifically request) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee. We had to call the front desk every day. And, housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl. I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded. These things may not matter to you, but if you plan to spend a week, like we did, you might want to be comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom were superior; just the living room was bad."

0,"We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels' website newsletter. Affinia has a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower. Beware however: parking is expensive in the Gold Coast....$48/night. Right from the start, Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome. Check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous. However, it was a handicapped acessible room and I wanted a tub, so one call to the front desk and we had another room. All rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful, comfortable and well appointed. The rooftop bar is a must-do. The outside patio has heaters and candles, a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views. We didn't sit inside the bar area. Pedro and Quentin were excellent bellmen, and Christopher (concierge) was very helpful. As we left, we shook Victor's hand (he's always there!) and told him we've found our new Chicago hotel!"

This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."

He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which are perfect for him. He wears a size 7 and it fit perfectly. I did have to give it a star because the shoes were extremely uncomfortable for him. He has had them for about two months now and they are very comfortable. They have held up very well, although he will probably wear them for about a month or so. I am really hoping they do not break in, but I can't say that. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not a real watch. I had to go back and reorder one, but I have no regrets. I will wear it everyday and will be buying more in the future. I will say this is a good watch for a kid who has small hands and needs something to wear on his wrist. I would definitely buy this again. Nice, lightweight shoe, very comfortable, and I ordered size up. I wore them for about 2 days and wore them a lot. I returned them. I am now wearing these shoes.

0,"Positives: Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations. Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.  Negatives: Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes: A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens. Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce. Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up. Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids. Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted. At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins. Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins. Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.  In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on."

I love the way the story unfolds and the twists and turns that happen with each new twist.  The story was all about the very beginning of the book.  I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job of pulling the reader in and showing us the world we live in.  The characters are all very well developed and believable.  I found myself rooting for the main character.  It was a great read.  This is a great series and I highly recommend it.This is a book about a teen girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with the girl who is obsessed with a boy who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who is obsessed with a girl who"

They are not good for hiking around which I did in them the first day, but with some insoles in them, they have been very comfortable and warm! A little bigger than I expected but sometimes I wear two pair of socks so I think think I'll keep the size I have. Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them. I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!  I lowered to a 3 from a 5.  The first pair were great but the second pair I bought took months to break in and caused so many blisters.  The waterproofing failed in one shoe fairly quickly so rainy days at work suck."

We had a double/double and it was the size of a college dorm room, plus completely white walls and linens. Absolutely no color except for one accent pillow. It was very sterile and uninviting. We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting. It looked like the entrance to hell, if not a haunted house. Staff was very nice and accomodating. I would not return to this hotel."

0,"Lawrence of Arabia  T. E. Lawrence's work ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" is an early classic on guerrilla warfare by the author who trained, organized, and led Arab irregulars against the Turks in the Great War (WWI). The book, which was originally published in 1927 presents some principles of guerrilla operation which are still applicable today. Unfortunately, these principles are often lost in the author's obsession for beautiful prose. Fortunately, for the modern student of guerrilla warfare and insurgency Lawrence set down his thoughts on the subject in another work entitled ""The Evolution of a Revolt"" which is a must read for the professional warrior."

The only negative I have is that it is very cheap material.  I am hoping the price will be higher, since he is a size 7.  Otherwise, it's a great watch.  The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot wear it with jeans.  However, it is not thin and thin enough to cover his entire body.  It is light, but very cool.  I have a size 8 and ordered a size 10.  I am hoping the price will go up a bit, since the band is a bit small and the band is a bit short.  UPDATE:  I ordered the large and it fit perfectly"

1,The book is not loaded with an easy-to-read format. There is a lot of time spent
0,"This is definitely my kind of book. It has everything that makes a really good thriller/adventure/military read. I loved the added mythology angle that was backed up by real sites. The science angle was believable and a the human experimentation added to the spine tingling parts. The action starts with the first page and you hardly have time to breath between pages. Robinson takes the reader on a rocket ride of adventure, treachery, treason and death. Each of his characters has special talents. Melding them into a fighting team is King's (Jack) job. In this story you get a lot of background about each team member. How and why the ""Chess Team"" was formed. Why Jack chose each name. Where Stan got his Desert Eagles. The first time Jack and Zelda met and what happened. How he won her respect and the rest of the teams. The bonds they formed with each other to become the fighting unit they are. Their first mission is to rescue a scientist who can translate an ancient manuscript. She has been kidnapped by unknown persons. The Chess Team follows the bad guys from Afghanistan to Iran and finally to France. They fight the Chinese tong, mutated humans, and unspeakable horrors. Finally in France they face the end of all life and maybe, the end of the planet. This is my first book by Robinson but not my last. I have already got his other Chess Team books on my ""to get"" list. I wish they were all audio books narrated by Jeffery Kafer. He has a very pleasing voice and gives life to the characters. He gets the dialogue between the team just perfect. Sometimes too perfect. LOL. The production of the audio was perfect. No static, dead spots, or skips. Everything was professional and well recorded. If you have read any of Jeremy Robinson Chess Team books you HAVE to read this one. The start of it all. Audiobook provided for review by the narrator.

It has a standard length cord that will hold it in place if you hold it in place long enough.  The cord is very long, but I have not used it in a while.

Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued.

The story is told in a rather idyllic setting with no real name or place to call it, but the characters and the plots are so convincing that it is easy to understand why they chose to go to the location.  It's very refreshing to see the characters in action, and the setting is absolutely gorgeous, with colorful scenery, great music, a great musical score and a beautiful soundtrack that doesn't detract from the story.  The only problem I had with this series was that the ""top of the range"" prices for the sets were a bit high, which is a shame because I really liked the show.

0,"The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.  Update 31/10/16 Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons Cons: Cheap, toy feel   Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality.

0,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.  The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).  After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.  You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).  I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.  I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."
1,My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was by far the worst hotel stay I ever had. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a long film, and not for those who have never seen Dracula before, but for those who know that it is indeed a beautiful story, and will watch it over and over.  It is not too long, and it is filled with good ideas, and the characters are believable.  Overall, this is a good film, and I recommend it to everyone who has seen Dracula before, and for those who have"

However it's okay to be no since you can enjoy both sides of the fence. Eric and Nick are a couple who can't find the strength to enjoy each others company because...What would society think.  Both have parents who believe in their children.  Eric tho has a tough time no matter what he does and Nick longs for the love no matter what it takes from Eric. They both need each other.

The beds were large and extremely comfortable. The staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. From the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, I got the best customer service. The hotel was also conveniently located. It was within walking distance to the shopping center. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago."

0,"I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar..."

0,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here."

0,"4.5 stars  The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.  The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.  The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.  Review copy provided by the author."
0,"This is a wonderful family movie for older children and above. It is mostly about a man taking a chance and believing in himself and his vision. I loved how it showed the struggle his crew had with trusting his judgement at times, and the inner struggles each had with deciding whether or not they made the right decision to risk their lives on the venture. It doesn't have tons of action, but is a wonderful example of loyalty among friends, working together, and how humans can triumph over just about anything with planning, training, wisdom, and perseverance."

It does not have a charger if you use it with an external power supply. The charger is very easy to use and the color is very vibrant.

1,"Sex And The Psychic Witch (Crampled)  From The Book: A Novel by Diana Adams  Author: Diana Adams  Publisher: T&E  I enjoyed this book.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over 50 years.  As they are getting older and having to deal with the past, they are facing a new life together.  They are both young women who are very interested in each other.  They are both going through a difficult time, but they are also going through a very difficult time.  They are both trying to make it through the time together.  The story was very well written and the characters were well developed.  I think the main reason I give it 5 stars was because it was a very good story.

0,"The Midwest caper is the first soft crate I've ever owned and I love it, I've used it at MANY dog shows and other events over the years.  I own both the Midwest camper and now the Noz-To-noz soft crate.  I LOVE the Midwest camper because the zippers are SO strong, they have NEVER been stuck, I have long hair dogs and the fur never bothers the zippers (I wish I can say the same about the noz-to-noz zippers).  The thing I don't like about the Midwest Camper is that it's very hard to wash out the inside and to drip dry.  It does not have bottom suports so you can't just hose off the inside and stand it up to dry.  My dogs get very muddy after swimming and having to wash out the camper was too much trouble.  This is why I got the Noz-to-Noz.  But I do love the Midwest camper for how strong it's made and it's really held up well over the years of very heavy use."

0,"You're paying less than 10bucks for a pair of headphones.  If you're and audiophile and crystal clear sound and deep bass are your thing, don't get them.  For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.  Overall, great earbuds.  Using with my ipad for gaming/movies and iphone for music and games."

0,"I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.  The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.  Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter."

0,"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.  Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.  Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.  I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies."

Until, that is, the night that their daughter's friend drowned in the Hawthornes' pool, a terrible event that put a huge crack in Laurel's carefully maintained facade. The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a riveting, Southern gothic, family drama, driven by the skeletons in Laurel's closet, her fear for her own daughter, and her love-hate relationship with her glamorous older sister, Thalia. Did someone cause Mollie's drowning? Was it an accident or a murder? What does daughter Shelby know that she isn't telling? Does David have a mistress? Do ghosts really appear to Laurel? And, underlying all these foreboding questions is an even darker one, about a death that occurred during her childhood.  The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a real page turner, from the first to the final chapters."
0,"I thought that this would be more of a baseball book, as I'm a big fan of the nation's pastime. However, Babe Ruth figures into the story only tangentially as a means of helping to set the stage--Boston, as WWI is drawing to a close, and Prohibition is on its way. This book is a nice blend of fact and fiction, and the facts are more engrossing than the fiction. Boston at that time was a city in trouble, anxious to blame just about everything on the Communists, except perhaps the flu epidemic, and by the end I felt as if that had happened a couple of books ago. The family histrionics are fairly predictable, with the bad son (Connor), the good son (Danny, our hero), and the young son (Joe). Of course, Mom and Dad have their heads in the sand and think that the good son is really the bad son and vice versa. There's also Eddie, who came over on the boat from Ireland with Dad and is evil personified. Dad and Eddie are cops on the take, and Danny, also a cop, gets involved with unionizing the police force. And there's Luther Laurence, a black man on the run from the law. Even with all these cops around, only Eddie knows of Luther's past, and it is information that he uses for his own vile purposes."

But as soon as you start to torque with this, forget it, you're better off using your bare hands. The handles of the pliers, after about 3 weeks of light use, began to flop around which made this tool useless. The joints where the pliers and the handles join is crucial to the performance of this tool. There is no way to take this tool apart and repair those joints. So if it fails, the tool is garbage."
0,"Received this book as ARC from NetGalley for review. Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor #2). The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1).  A great addition to Debbie Macomber's easy reading novels about family and friendships in a small town. This new addition is a spin-off of sorts from her hugely popular Cedar Cove series which is now televised on Hallmark Channel. The characters at Rose Harbor are as friendly and hospitable as their neighbors in Cedar Cove. The setting revolves around a newly widowed woman who pours all her energy into the Inn which she was supposed to run with her husband. The interesting characters who come by for a visit are sure to delight.  In the second book, Jo Marie continues putting the final touches on the Inn with help from a handyman who doesn't like to talk about himself much. Although she finds him incorrigible at times, they seem to enjoy each other's company. A friendship appears to be in bloom at Rose Harbor Inn."

0,"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.  It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.  The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.  So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.  I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.  UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry."

I am really glad I purchased it. I love the series and have watched it many times. I have watched it several times and it always keeps my attention.

0,"Until Brueggeman's Old Testament Theology was published in 1997, this was  the largest dose one could find in one place. The articles in this  collection were all previously published in journals and other collections,  but tracking them all down would be a difficult task. Therefore, the  volume is very worthwhile. Even in the light of his most recent  publications it is still a useful collection for a couple of other reasons. First, these articles were produced over a period of a couple of decades,  so the attentive reader can observe Brueggeman's biblical theology as it  developed over his career. Second, many of the articles are sustained  treatments of individual texts, the likes of which do not appear in his  recent Old Testament Theology. Most importantly, these essays reveal the  increasing impact of contemporary literary studies on Old Testament  Theology. For all of these reasons this collection is a treasure and may  be considered a prerequisite for reading Brueggeman's ""Old Testament  Theology:  Testimony, Advocacy, and Dispute."

0,"What a wonderful movie this is! The triumph of form over content portrayed with icy precision. Characters acknowledge each other  mostly in terms of self-absorbed one-upsmanship. Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short. Don't miss this film. It's also very funny. You just have to meet Patrick Bateman, a really swell guy."

0,"FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.  And as everyone has already stated, this film is in widesreen and looks mighty sweet.  NO COMPLAINTS.  I can't give this set 5 stars because I think FEAR is not worthy.  BUt if you can find this cheaper than the stated price, maybe $10 or so, then you're taking about a 5 star purchase."

The come with changeable nose pieces so you can find your perfect fit. The hold is very tight so they will not leak. You don't have to press very hard for them to suction on. The strap is easily adjusted so you don't have to fight with it. It has a wide range of sizes so it should fit most perfectly. A huge plus is they come with UV protection because keeping your eyes protected is very important. The storage case has drainage vents at the bottom so you can just place them in the protective case after use. I would purchase these goggles again.

1,"A totally different workout from what I was used to. I did not need a rigid rack, but a pair of the Kydex pedals and the basic Teton pedals. I used these to do a couple of bench press exercises, and one for my bench press. I also used the Kydex pedals to do the most common type of bench press exercises. I've also used these for my bench press with the Kydex pedals."
0,"When I first received the clip and turned it on, it froze while listening to the radio. I managed to get it unfroze by connecting it to the computer - holding down the power button didn't do anything.  I spent a little time transferring audio files to it, then it went dead completely. Won't turn on. Won't connect to computer.  Submitted it for return to Amazon today and now I have to wait another week to try it again.  Considering I bought some accessories to go with it, if I can't get a functioning mp3 player, I'll be pretty upset at the waste of time and money.  ETA:  I received a replacement which worked and as of April 2014, it's still working fine."

Although newer computers use USB 3.0 ports and are suppose to be backwards compatible, this may not be the case.  And, although it appears to function, and you don't get an error message, or maybe you do, you still are not going to get all you can, usage wise, from this terrific mouse.  It is a well made product.  Fits perfectly in your hand.  Allows you to set your DPI.  It can serve as a portable mouse, or as I use mine, a permanent mouse for my desktop.  I paired it with my Anker keyboard for a perfect fit.  I would highly recommend this product."

0,"INSTALLATION TIPS: 1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later. 2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.  BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.  BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious."

0,"I stayed in this hotel during a business trip, and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar, a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet. Security was informed, but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them. After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident, despite the fact that I was a hotel guest. Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait. Long story short, I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone, anyone would have talked to me about it. I've since been on the phone with a manager, who promised to call me back once she researched the incident, and have yet to hear back, despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago. I expected more from this hotel."
1,"Before medical dramas like ""ER"", ""Criminal Minds"" and ""The Matrix"" have been done, the two have had a similar effect.  The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a police force, and one of the men is still there.  In the meantime, the police force is losing its moral compass, and it is up to him to save the day.  The story is a bit weak on the feet of a good director, but it's still a fun twist on the series.  I loved the first season, and I'm looking forward to the second season.  This is a fun show, and I'm glad I did.  I recommend this show to everyone.Great movie!!  I can watch it over and over again.  Love it!This is a very good story with good acting.  The premise is pretty simple, but the story is pretty funny.  I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.  It is about a good guy, but he is always doing something bad, so he is always doing it right.  It is a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone who has a heart.  It is a good movie.  It is fun.  Great movie.  I recommend it to anyone who has a heart."

The Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison. This hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time. Service was impeccable. Friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes. The gym has new equipment with plenty of space. And such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. I have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased. My new 'Chicago Hotel'. It will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels."

0,"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.  This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.  If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.  The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should."
0,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far."
0,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.  The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.  After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.  This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours."

0,"I was kind of hoping these would replace my current brown everyday work shoes (Doc Martin-looking Sketchers oxfords).  They do seem comfy enough to fill that purpose, but I don't think they're the sort of shoe to wear outside in any kind of winter weather.  More of a spring/fall shoe.  They're just not that substantial -- either the sole or upper.  The leather is super soft, broken in unlike any shoe I've ever seen and kind of thin-- sort of like kid leather.  This makes them very comfy, but not like anything I'd want to step in a slushy puddle in, plus I don't think they'll be very warm at all.  I deemed them to ""fit as expected"" because as a 7.5, the 8s were a little big on me.  Don't know why they couldn't manage half sizes.  They seem to run a bit narrow, also, but they are so soft and pliable I have no doubt they'll stretch out easily if your foot isn't excessively wide (mine is a tad wide).  At any rate, they seem well worth the bargain price I paid ($25, I think), so I will keep them. Update:  I should also emphasize that the soles aren't very supportive.  They sort of have a ""barefoot"" feel like 5-toe shoes or minimal running shoes -- not a bad thing at all, but might not work for some.  You might say they are like a moccasin dressed up as an oxford."

Our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. I'm not a germ freak or anything; however, I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to. The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention (FCCLA) and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it. The noise at night from every direction. The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party. Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic. With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another, absolutely ridiculous. The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo.

0,"This sight was really impressive for the money. At ~20$ you could have a high-contrast bead. The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too. I put it on a micro-compact 9 and it is not too big. the multiple thread sizes were great and I just opened the original hole  slightly for threading and had a 20$ high-contrast fiber post."

Having been a fan of hers from her first novel, The Raven Prince, I was delighted to pick up this newest tale of love, loss, and redemption. While this book is the tenth in the series, I am ashamed to say I have missed the last two or three, and wasn't confused at all when I picked this one up, so Duke of Sin can absolutely be read as a stand alone.    Montgomery has returned from his exile with a score to settle. Hoping to gain redemption and ruin those who had wronged him, Montgomery ventures into a seedy underbelly. Bridget Crumb, Montgomery's newest housekeeper, has secrets and her own agenda. In a world filled with intrigue and never knowing who your friends or enemies truly are, Bridget and Montgomery find kindred spirits within one another. Only Hoyt can have this mysterious Duke find common ground with a destitute, secretive housekeeper who ultimately find their happily ever after.    As I mentioned before, I had missed a few of the last novels. Boy, am I fixing this ASAP. Hoyt's worlds are just so nuanced and layered, and once you start it all just clicks. Romantic to its core, Hoyt writes unique characters, each and every time, which I adore. No cookie cutter heroine or hero, their traits and characteristics give you an insight into who they are, their motivations, and ultimately their fates. Gorgeously written as always, with plenty of sexytimes, romantic to the core, and just plain lovely, I can't recommend Duke of Sin highly enough. Just a great story, with fabulous characters, written in Hoyt's trademark wit, I can't recommend this book highly enough."

0,"great stuff; tastes like fresh cut vegetables in my hiking soups and chicken cous-cous mixes. Even the chicken-ish, beef-ish and ham-ish tvp protein is decent (I didn't have high expectations about tofu meat substitutes). Bring your spices and salt since these are not spiced up (which is excellent since it is easier to add a little salt or spice than to over come excessive flavoring by someone else). The fruit is nice; eat as is or add to breakfast ceral or desert mixes- hydrates fairly fast."

0,"So here is how this device operates.  The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.  If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.  There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.  The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.  Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.  This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used."
0,"These sorts novels rest a lot on believable characters. The problem with Florida novels is that real living characters in Florida often eclipse any fictional characters for stupidity, corruption and evil intent. This is the state that attracts serial killers, Koran burning ministers, scammers and con artists, and whose main reputation in other states for monumental zaniness. Here Randy Wayne White has created a sane grounded, and admirable character. Most importantly he doesn't make her a superwomen, kung fu warrior. She's brave and tough and smart, but she makes mistakes in a dangerous situation that are both human and suspenseful. The sort that anyone placed in a highly stressful situation would make. My complaint about a lot of writers in this genre is their characters are too masterful and unbelievable and you can lose interest in them easily. The second part that I liked about this is its a tightly plotted ""little"" story that deals with evil and takes us on a little journey through west florida and the thousand islands. And that too makes it very readable. The challenge for Randy White is that of a male trying to write in the first person about a female. I think it's extremely difficult to do. And I think the author does a good job of this. But not quite. Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It could be that as a fan I could not forget the male Doc of his other novels, and I had the odd sensation of the marine biologist sort of springing out in drag sometimes. I'm pretty much convinced though that this is more my fault than the authors. If you are a fan read this one. It's even better if you are new to his fiction. It's great, and a new start, for White. I think Hanna, as a fishing guide, and cracker descendent, will be able to go places that the good Doctor can't quite find."

I highly recommend these to anyone who needs a water bottle!We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 years old, and he is a finicky eater.  He has been feeding himself this food for about a year now.  We bought this for a puppy that was about 3 1/2 years old.  He has never eaten anything else.  He was obsessed with this food, but now he doesn't seem to mind.  We are not sure if he is a finicky eater or if he is a finicky eater.  It is a very small dog, and he eats about 1/2 cup per day, so this seems to be a good food for him.  He will be a finicky eater for awhile to come, but he will not eat this food any more.

0,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.  Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper. By the end of the third book I had more than 100 bookmarks."

My cat loves her dart & she's an even bigger sucker for string; her last string arm toy she completely destroyed - she's not very gentle with her ""prey"", so I was delighted to see this string almost completely incased in a plastic compartment. Unfortunately the string doesn't move sporadically in the manner that the dart varies in speed & quickly changes direction. This toy goes one speed, one direction. Pretty boring & predictable, my cat just times the string then grabs it & drags the entire toy around the house with her as it struggles & whirs."

0,"It fit three larger adults laying on towels in it - if you want to put beach chairs in it only two would fit comfortably with a nice amount of room.  the only reason it was not 5 stars is because of the SPF protection.  We bought small clips and layed our towels on top of it for better sun protection.  Assembly was just three poles that easily slipped into metal rings at each end and took maybe 5 minutes to assemble. The only downside is that the poles sometimes come apart after you slide them in & cause a little bit of a struggle - but nothing life shattering.  I suggest doing a trial run before going to the beach with it.  Despite the minor flaws we are happy with the purchase and feel the extra roominess of this shelter is worth the trade off of the minor flaws.  Overall, we would buy this again!"

When I opened the plastic bag that was sealed and got the blanket out, the cardboard sleeve around the blanket was damp. The blanket was damp too. My first thought was OMG, it's used and it was pet urine!  I did a sniff test and I didn't smell anything foul.  I decided to keep the blankets since there was no defects other than the damp one. I am washing them really good to be on the safe side. I want to add, there was no sign of water damage to the Amazon box upon arrival. The other blanket was dry and the plastic bag the wet blanket was in was dry. ONLY the blanket inside the bag was wet. This is a good indication it was packaged wet and shipped to me."
0,"Chuck Palahniuk is most known as the author of Fight Club, the book that became the movie with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; and overnight Palahniuk had a cult following. Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.  This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.  From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores. This book will at times, turn your stomach, but will give you an understanding of the darkest side of human nature.  Readers beware! This book is like the fight club movie on super steroids.  (First Printed in Imprint 2005-06-03 as 'Fight Club author gets Haunted')"

0,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly. Here's all the things that aren't good first: 1. Many parts to clean every time one brews 2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking 3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine  If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee. Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!  ONE FUNNY AND GOOD POINT!  When it works, it makes a delicious cup of coffee!"

This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.  Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.  The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.  I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way."

0,"ISBN 034536161X - Back to books related to WWII and religious artifacts. As a group, these books are interesting if only for the complete effect - from Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders to The DaVinci Code to Indiana Jones, the differences and similarities in the tales are fascinating. Indy begins the book by closing out his nearly lifelong chase after the Cross of Coronado. Ready for a return to the academic life, he returns late for the school year, only to find that his father is missing. Henry Jones has his own lifelong chase nearing an end - he appears to be within sight of the Grail Cup, and there are several groups of people who will do anything to beat him to it. Nazis, Henry's assistant Elsa, and a secret Brotherhood all have their eyes on the same prize, for their own reasons. Who will reach it first isn't nearly as important as who will be allowed to claim it. As adventure books on the subject go, The Last Crusade is an odd mix of lightheartedness and murder, which detracts from the excitement of the story in the book but played well in the movie. Overall, though, it's a nice adaptation of the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam."

The characters were interesting and you felt like you were part of the story. It was a good read. I can't imagine what to say about this book. I'm not a fan of most of the books in the series. But I love this one. This book is a must read for any fan of all time. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but I will say that it is a well written book. It has lots of twists and turns that make you want to read more. It is a fun read."
0,"I bought this today for my 3 year old son. I was debating whether to get the Jr since it was for ages 1-4, but after looking at their book selections, I opted for the regular Tag. He liked it at first just pointing to the words and repeating after it. It's great that you can change the settings on each page on some books so it reads word by word, read each letter of the work, or sounding out the word. He's not yet dragging the tag across each row to read it in order, but I think he will grasp it over time. I just ordered the Learning to Read Book Set 1 from Amazon which should be easier for him than the regular storybooks at this time. We'll see."

0,"Its always been a struggle for me to find clothes that fits perfectly on me. One that I don't have to do something and alter it or cut the legs to be the exact length for my legs. I am size one and the waist and hips of size one usually fits on me aside from the legs part. They usually are longer and even though I got a size one of thissuper comfy stretch denim five pocket jeans it is still a little big on me especially on the hip and back side maybe because I am not that gifted on that part. The hip is also a bit higher than my usual preference but that is fine since I don't tuck my shirts. I wish that the front pockets are a little deeper. These are the down sides when purchasing clothes online. Even if you got your size there is no guarantee that it fits exactly the same. Others are cut differently and sometimes smaller or bigger on you. I will just have to remedy it since thats what I normally do. Despite that the jeans was well made and the stitches are sturdy. The fabric stretches just like they said it is which is a good thing since for me, stretchable jeans are more comfortable to wear and easier to take off than the denims. This comes in six different colors. I got the black coz back when I got it, other colors doesnt have my size.

0,I have 3 Male Italian Greyhounds who have very hard to fit body shapes. If you can make a few quick stitches you can make the Gooby fit like a glove. The Gooby has an open V neck. I lay one side of the V over the other side of the V.  I then sew it together making it fit their skinny necks.  This also keeps the Gooby from sliding back next to their penis. This prevents the Male IG from peeing on their Gooby.  I use their Girth (chest) measurement to purchase the correct size. I will attach a picture of my Gooby already sew together.
0,"""Playing Dead"" is a thrilling novel from beginning to end. Julia Heaberlin is a gifted writer and the novel's protagonist, Tommie McCloud is a little firecracker to say the least. Tommie is grieving the death of her beloved father as the story opens. But one day, she receives a letter in the mail saying her whole childhood could be a total lie. This is one of those books where it's impossible to explain the entire premise but I might say,  I did feel like ""Playing Dead"" had some plot holes. But even with those plot holes, I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun, entertaining, and the ending was expected. I highly recommend it."

I just want to add I love the show and the characters. I will buy this one.I remember when I was young. I remember watching the cartoons when they were still in the air. I remember being so fascinated by the characters that I was hooked. I remember my first TV show on the air. I remember watching the cartoons when I was a kid and the cartoons were such a hit. I was a fan of the show when it was first aired and I still am.  I don't know why I didn't like it when I was a kid, but I really enjoyed it. I didn't really see it until about 18 years ago when I was a kid and it was very good.  I wish I could say I enjoyed it more now, but I have to say it's a great series. It's a great show"

0,"The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy. The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding, making it dark. They charge a lot for internet hook up, wifi is not included. The staff was very slow, I am assuming they were all new. They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby. The room was set up weird, the bathroom opened facing the bed, rather than the hall as most do. Room temp was hard to control, even though they had a digital thermostat. Overall I was very disappointed, had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels."

0,"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.  G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.  This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.  CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.  Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:  G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts. A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.  Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage."

0,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.  Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.  I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.  While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.  There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.  A very solid 4/5 Stars.  {This title was received free of charge from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

The TRS-80A is a great head for those who want to use a large head for the web. The TRS-80A has a very low profile and is very light weight. The TRS-80A has a nice feel to it. I like that the TRS-80A is adjustable so it can be adjusted. You can also adjust the tvs up to 6"" and the tvs down to 5""."

If you have a lighter touch and don't manhandle the brush like I do, it may be a good fit for you. I had some trouble with the first brush, but the seller was immediately there to try and resolve the issue.  He sent me another brush and assured me that it was a very rare manufacturing anomaly.  He even went so far as to focus on looking to see what may have happened at the manufacturing facility.  I only mention this because if you are even remotely thinking about purchasing this, you can with confidence as the owner/CEO stands firmly behind his invention."

1,"Hotel Monaco is simply amazing. I travel quite a bit, and am use to generic hotels, with horribly unimpressive rooms, and '5 star amenities' which usually mean a packet of instant coffee, and room service that won't serve after 9pm. Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. This hotel has such personality. My absolute favorite part of my stay, aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs, was the in-room spa treatment. Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. Generic just won't do anymore."

0,"The Forgotten Jesus helped me exchange my Western viewpoint of scripture for that of a Torah-faithful Jew. Gallaty doesnt reinterpret the Bible, rather he explains the significance and symbolism of Jesus words, actions, and the Rabbinical methods of instruction he employed. By doing so, he made connections and provided insights which I wouldn't have made on my own.  It took me a few days to tackle roughly 200 pages of text (not counting the reading plan or extensive endnotes) because I read with my Bible open and a notepad ready. At the end, I am left with 24 post-flags and two pages of shorthand notes Id like to discuss with my book group. Not since reading Sitting at the Feet of Rabbi Jesus (co-authored by Ann Spangler and Lois Tverberg) have I been so completely enthralled by the community and culture of first-century Judaism. I cannot wait to encounter these portions of scripture in my reading plan with fresh eyes. Highly recommend!  I received a copy of this book for free, a favorable review was not required of me.

It introduces the reader and the main character to the dragon unit of the British military during the Napoleanic era.  The main point is the bond between the dragon and its rider, mixed with a little bravery and military logistics."
0,"The hero of this novella was perfect.  He was romantic, masculine, loving, etc. and so I read this story mostly to get to his happily ever after.  The heroine was annoying.  I'm a little tired of the cliche storyline where the woman doesn't want to get involved with cop/firefighter/generic hero because of the possibility of future loss.  It's a bit over the top and has been done many times over.  My biggest issue with the heroine is that she would leave her husband without any explanation.  Who would do that?  And why would he want her back.  But, this is a romance so the play acting that they have to do in front of the heroine's family is funny and there is a happily ever after."

The singing and dancing is not ""Bollywood"", but it is a good movie. Several members of our family love Pride and Prejudice (and all things Jane Austen) and we all enjoy Bollywood movies, too - so  this movie was a perfect family hit! Aishwarya Rai is fabulous and so is  Anupam Kher. The lines are memorable, and make this an oft quoted movie in our home. It's hard to find here in the U.S, at a reasonable price, so jump on this one when the price goes down. It's one worth watching over and over again."

0,"I admire the author for many reasons--one for revealing so much of herself--and then not so much for undertaking the PCT but for undertaking it without any idea of what she was doing--putting herself into serious pain--and depite the conditions not giving up!!  ""Into the Wild"" by John Krakauer comes to mind when reading the book. Cheryl running from her past--running from emotional pain--into a world of extremes on the PCT--not knowing what she will find in front of her--much like the character in Into the wild--unlike McCandless..fortunately for Cheryl--her ending was a good one!!!  For those who may choose to follow the path--searching for something--seek out some advice at least on equipment!! I'll bet if you ask Cheryl today if she could have shaved 20 pound off her load what the difference might have made....and I'm sure if you were able to ask Christopher McCandless if he would rethink going into the wild without a map which showed that there was a way across the river only 1/2 mile from the bus where he died--he would be the first to advocate being better prepared.  ""Wild"" is truly inspirational-and highly recommended!"

The prerecorded phrases and ""breathing"" sound are very realistic. It came with demo batteries, but they did not work, so we had to take it out of the package and put new batteries in it. The instructions consist of pictures only, so it was a little confusing as to where the batteries go. We actually took the wrong cover off (it was the forehead pad) thinking the batteries were under it, and it broke in the process, but it was easily glued back on. As with any electronic toy for a 6 year old, I'm not sure how long this will hold up, but so far, he loves it."

I would recommend these bulbs if you are looking for a dimmable light fixture.Works great. I installed them in the kitchen and they are very strong. They will last a long time. I highly recommend these bulbs.I love this little gadget.  I have it mounted in my desk lamp, and it works really well.  It has a small button that activates it, and a long, narrow wire that goes to the top.  It is a very good size for this little device, and I don't think I would have to worry about it"

I can see in the picture, that it's going to be a bit short for the long-sleeve version, but it will be pretty close.  I haven't really tried it out on a bike yet, but I think it's going to be a good compromise for me.  I haven't shot a lot of bikes, but I'm not sure how long it'll hold up.  I'll update this review if I find it helpful.  Update:  I've had this for about a month now.  It's bright and bright enough to see my neighbors.  I also don't have to worry about the metal going up.  It's just not on the low end of the range.  I've used this for about a month now and it's holding up great.  UPDATE 2/13/15:  I've tried it on a dirt bike and it's very bright, and I haven't had a problem with it.  It's not a deal breaker, but if you're running on dirt it's not a deal breaker either"
0,"I think the only reason I like this movie is because I haven't seen the Orignal. Most people who have seen the orginal and enjoyed it shouldn't even try to watch a re-make, not just for this film but any because no matter how good it was they'll hate it. I have to say I enjoyed all the re-makes so far. ""The Grudge""; ""One Missed Call"" and so on and so forth. I also like these because I haven't seen the org: The movie is worth watching."

1,"A few nights ago, I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago. I'd heard some amazing things about the great food, and how friendly the staff were. Upon arrival, the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time! The rooms were cozy, with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. I ordered breakfast the next morning, and had room service bring it up. The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering, and was delicious! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling, or any families staying in Chicago, as the rooms were very reasonably priced, and is a short distance to lots of great sites. Next time I come through Chicago, I will definitely be staying here!"
1,"After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel. The problems started in the parking lot, yup before I even got in. There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage, broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble. Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room. The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out. The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking. When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed, the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on. This was only the beginning of our terrible stay. Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long. The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass. We could not check out soon enough! We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip."

She has a dog that is on a diet and a hard time eating her food. I wanted to give this product a try because I know that my dog will not eat her food and I am hoping that it will help her because it has the right ingredients. It is a very good product for dogs and I would recommend it to others. I would also recommend it for anyone who has a picky eater. It is very easy to put together and is easy to assemble. I have a very picky dog and this food is perfect. I would definitely recommend this product. I'm not sure about this product. I was skeptical about it until I found it on Amazon. I have two cats, and they all love it. They have a very picky eater."

0,"Monopoly Electronic Banking certainly reflects the world we live in. I don't know the last time my kids actually saw me pay for anything with cash. In this version of Monopoly each player (up to 6 players) is provided an electronic debit card. With this debit card they purchase properties, pay rent, buy houses, etc.  At first I didn't know how I felt about this money-less version. It sure was easy to set up. No more sorting and counting fake $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills. However, I wasn't sure if my kids would understand that they didn't have an endless supply of money and that how they spent their money had an impact on the games outcome, since they didn't have the money visibly in front of them.  It didn't take them too long to catch on though. By the fourth time around the board they were asking about their balances and not just buying things without some thought.  Also, they easily caught on to how to raise their balance by adding properties, houses, and collecting rent.  The banker controls the electronic device that controls all the money. They have to insert a person's card, input the correct amount of $$$s and push the right button.  It isn't too complicated. If your child is comfortable using a simple calculator they should be able to manage this just fine.  Like the original Monopoly, this isn't a quick game. You can easily spend a couple hours playing. One nice thing that we found about the Electronic version, was the ability to easily take a break from the game. Everyone's balances remained stored on the banking device until we came back to the game and we didn't have to worry about all the loose bills getting scattered. If we want to start a new game, we just hit a single button on the banker's until it resets. Very easy.  I still like the original Monopoly, but this up-dated version is both fun and realistic."

What a great main character for this story. I never give out spoilers or rehash the books description.  That said even though it's in the Heaven sent series, it's not related to any of the characters in book one.  This story stands on its own.

0,"This is the perfect story to read when you have a few hours free and you just want to dream away and relax for a little while. Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.  Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!  Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.  I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.  The story is told from both POV's. Im really happy that the writer Anna Campbell gave this story an epilogue! It gave this story that something more."
0,"We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.  We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.  I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!"

0,"I am no longer a part of the YA age group. In fact I ignored my husband and children to read this series. I love them, and can't wait to read them with my kids when they are older.  The series is one of the best written in terms of showing the emotion and thoughts that happen with first love.  One of the great things that I appreciate about Eclipse is the way they discuss and work to maintain moral boundries while showing the turmoil that happens with temptation.  I love the story lines.  I woudn't be surprised to find Bella and Edward in my address book, that is how real these characters have become. I can't wait for Stephenie's upcoming books to be released! I even bought this series, which is a rarety for me!  I can't believe I can rave about a book about vampires.  The book is actually about differences, and we all have those in our relationships.  Great series.  Start with the first one, and work up to Eclipse to get the full effect."

0,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.  But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.  For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.  Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.  It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."

But there is just something about it that kept my kid's attention for a long time.  He was all over using the drill to put the bolts into the board, then unscrew them, then back and forth again.  It is the darndest thing.  So it looks overly simple, and to my adult eyes I can't help but wonder what the big deal is.  But I'm not a four year old, and said four year old was enamored with it.  Of course we had to get one of our own.  The biggest challenge is keeping all the parts together - screws get lost and all of that, but it's still fascinating for that kid.  It's a great toy."

It's filled with over the top violence and vulgarities and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind violence and vulgarities if it adds to the story. That's not what happened here however. If I had a dollar for every time a character used the f-word (an most characters did, multiple times in one sentence.) I could have made a decent wad of cash. The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.   As for the story? A James Bond want-to-be with none of the charm or wit. That's this movie in a nutshell. There were no redeeming qualities to this film for me.

I was confused by the movie's title, as it was the name of the film.  I remembered it as ""The One"" and I thought ""what the hell is that?""  I could not help but chuckle at the movie's title and thought, ""what the hell is that?""  I thought I would be lost, but I was wrong.  I was actually not completely sure why this movie was called ""The One"".  It was probably because of the theme song.  The movie had a lot of music, but I thought it was the only one that I could understand.  It was also a little hard to figure out the meaning of the words.  In the end, I really enjoyed the movie.  I will probably never understand it"

I have never read a book that has such a good ending.  I felt like I was right there with the main character.  I'm not going to say too much because the ending is too abrupt, but I feel like the author did a great job of giving the book a great ending.  I read the first two books in the series and I loved this one.  The author does an excellent job with the story and the characters.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

I just wish there was a way to replace the metal bars on the bottom of the basket. The material is soft and durable. The color is black and the handle is very well made. This basket is super light and easy to carry. The basket is not too big, which makes it easier to carry around.

However, I did come upon this wonderful gem accidentally and I could not be happier. I have read both books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Can not wait for the third book in this series. Great characters, great chemistry between the H/h, excellent plots and twists. You won't be disappointed. My personal beef with books in this genre, is when the heroines are redundantly stupid and frustrating throughout the story. If you can get past that, you will definitely enjoy this series. I read it with my Kindle Unlimited subscription, but went back to purchase both books. Hopefully book three will be out soon. Great BWWM story you won't want to miss."

I think this is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. I recommend it to anyone interested in horror and to those who want a good series.

0,"POk - Thorough-but-to-the-point review bc these are $$ and purposeful (warmth/tread/hiking).  VERDICT: GREAT BOOTS.  Size: Runs one size small, as many said (I wear a 5 and have NEVER tried on a shoe I could not fit into! Lol.)  I didn't take off a star for it bc it's warned about enough on here to know.  Height: At a short-legged 5'4"", they ended @ 1.5"" below the knee (so not as curiously high as as many found). HOWEVER, bigger size, bigger proportions. My 5s surely run a inch shorter than a 10 would.  Fit: Slightly narrow, but leather stretches/adjusts to your foot, so... Not much breaking in for me.  Quality/Warmth: Leather is soft and nice. Lining is ideal and warm. The top studs actually keep the laces in place (I rarely see that!) contoured and supported my foot well (nothing spectacular either if you have special needs there) a just average). Can't attest to durability bc they're new. And, of course, the laces provide complete adjustment to your own foot, while the side zipper lets you keep it that way (and makes the on/off process quick and easy.) What a concept! Never thought it would be so hard finding a lace/zip winter boot.  WHAT THE ...?!m There is a slippery finish on the soles that i was sliding all all over the place. I think (HOPE!!!!) it rubs off as you wear it. Still - makes you wonder and have to use it beyond return to know, and you can't evaluate the real tread before committing.  Not cool. Lost a star."
0,I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.

I have used it a couple of times and it seems to hold up very well.I'm a huge fan of this product and I can tell you I've had no problems with my dog getting into the bag from the first day I opened it. I'm sure this helps a little with the dog getting into the bag as well. I also think this is a great product and would be great for other dog owners who might have issues with getting into the bag. I've never had a problem with the dog getting into the bag or anything else and I've never had issues with the dog getting in the"

0,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protector. Guess I use the sheets to substitute for that.
0,"Unfortunately, this movie is not very good.  Such an epic moment in time truly deserves a good movie, and I was suckered into watching this on the grounds that I may have stumbled upon one.  Well, there was a reason why I'd never heard of this movie, that reason being: because this movie is really bad at being a movie.  It's EXTREMELY hackneyed and cliched, and doesn't make that okay by being fun to watch.  It's not bad because it's an anti-war movie or for any political reasons, it's bad because it's boring and poorly put together as a film.  Maybe someday they'll make a good movie about The Battle of the Somme, but as of 2016, that day hasn't come."

0,"We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. We were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. The view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked, trolleyed, and cabbed all around the area. We ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. The eggs were a little runny, but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) The rooms were clean, the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we're in Chicago next time."
1,"I looked all over for this. The only one I found that worked for me was the one in the picture. The other one was a bit cheaper and worked fine. The only thing I had to change was the size of the hose. This is a large hose that is about a 2/4"" diameter and will fit about 3/4"" of the hose. I just went with the smaller hose. The only reason I didn't buy this one was because it was a little too big for my hand."

0,"Let me preface this review with noting that I absolutely LOVE books where a dog or animals are the main or central character.  The Art of Racing in the Rain is nothing more than the political, social and anti-science commentary of the author who disguises such as being told or observed by Enzo, the dog in the book. I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially given the many rave reviews this book garnered, but I was highly disappointed with many aspects of this book.  Analogies to racing (automobile) are exceptionally redundant, and the characters were, I thought, not well developed in the least. The story plods along with Enzo seeing the world through his eyes (and the shortcomings of not possessing thumbs), which had promise; but unfortunately the author uses the canine as an outlet for his own political and social commentary.  Yes, there were a few chuckles throughout, but sadly, the book is more a success of exceptional marketing rather than exceptional writing or storytelling.  As mentioned, I love books where the dog or animals are the main character(s): If Only I Could Talk, White Fang, The Call of the Wild, The Wind in the Willows and many others. Unfortunately, The Art of Racing in the Rain, although it held promise, falls very short if you are a fan of these types of books."
1,"The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby, you will never want to leave. The multiple ballrooms, board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. If you're looking for leisure activities, there are two bars, the Lockwood Wine Cellar, and an indoor pool. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. Room service is excellent, and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city."

0,"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...  While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.  These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.  If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.  RATING: A-/B+ (4 stars)"

0,"I liked the story.  By now you know what the story is about so I won't go into that.  I thought the storyline was good.  I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.  She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.  Seems he was made to grovel and she was the one that ran rather than staying and discussing things with him.  But, this is one of those stories you need to read for yourself.  I found it very interesting and I definitely would recommend it.  I did read some of the low star reviews and I had to agree with a lot of what they said but I did like the story."

0,"Because the author gave me a copy of her book to review, Amazon will not say verified purchase. I started off reading this novel kind of slow, as I myself am also an author. I found this book from the fourth page on to be written with charm. On every page, there is a twist and turn that seems like it would really happen in real life. One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house. I could relate to growing up with houses that I thought were haunted and I remember going in them and running out because I was so scared. Eventually, everyone has to face something that they are not willing to. It'sa good read and I think anyone reading it will enjoy it."

0,Growing up in Brooklyn I fell in love with the Brooklyn Bridge. I courted my future wife walking over that bridge several times in my 20s. This book has captured the whole essence of what the bridge meant to NY and Brooklyn. The background of the politics and the people who made it happen are described and fully captured in the book. Lots of info of just what materials and how much were used in the bridge and how the many problems and unknowns were addressed made for fascinating reading. McCullough has done his wonderful thing with this book.

Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in, we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention, she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault. Needless to say I will not be staying here again."

So you would have to have the main unit in the house on one side of a window and the receiver somewhere outside mounted but not in the sun, oh and not where it can get wet, oh and not too far away, etc., etc..  There are tons of restrictions about the placement which make the secondary temperature gauge virtually useless.  Who has the PERFECT spot to mount it in relation to the main device?  I thought you could mount the temperature gauge anywhere outside but you can not.  Can't be in the sun, can't get wet, can't have X number of walls or barriers between the main unit and the other gauge.  I actually should have sent it back.  Would not recommend unless you don't care about the second gauge and if that's the case, you can find one cheaper."
0,"Books about successful technology companies are usually written by the entrepreneurs who founded the companies. It is truly remarkable for a book about a company which has grown from nothing to one of the largest computer companies in the world, written by an employee with a HR background and another employee with a diversity background. However, that is what we find with this book by Gina Qiao and Yolanda Conyers, suggesting that the key features of the company are at least as much tied up in its attitude towards employees and diversity as they are in the actual products the company sells.  The book describes a company which began with a group of Chinese scientists who had no commercial experience. Starting by renting out their expertise, then becoming distributors for international computer brands, then creating a Chinese-language motherboard, Legend Computers gradually grew to a position of dominance in the Chinese market before changing its English name to Lenovo and turning its ambitions towards a global market.  Many international companies have suffered culture shocks trying to take over Chinese companies; this book described the culture shocks Lenovo faced digesting the acquisition of the IBM personal computers business. A typical multinational company has a headquarters and dominant culture in one country; Lenovo has chosen not to pursue that route. It has adopted English as its language of businesses, requiring a significant sacrifice on the part of its founders and original staff. In different parts of the world, local culture prevails, rather than a monolithic head-office-imposed culture.  This book describes one way in which a truly international company can succeed, but it requires a lot of trust-building and willingness to sacrifice ones own interests. According to the authors:  We don't just say nice words about cultural diversity; we live it. That is the Lenovo Way."

0,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".  Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.  Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.  In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).  Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.  You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!"

0,"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.  I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.  It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans."

0,"I thought this was a fantastic fantasy read. There's not a ton of surprises, everything seems pretty spelled out along the way so if you don't pick up on the hints on who really is the Black Knife then you must not been paying attention. Maybe the ending or Patrick's declaration for where he sees Wil and him in the future was the only plot surprises. I think having secret identities in stories makes for a fun read. The wraith took me a bit to understand exactly how that plays out to be the enemy. The magic system could have been explained more. I'm starting The Mirror King right away so no big cliffhanger wait for me to find out what happens."
0,"Despite the errors in editing and there were not many of them, the story was great.  I got into it quickly and it was hard to put down.  I had it figured it who was the stalker to both Victoria and to Jack, with a little twist I didn't see coming.  The characters were believable and you could easily see where future books are headed.  Victoria is a fiesty woman who knows what she wants and goes after it.  Duke and Jack are perfect for Victoria and they make a great threesome.  I loved the scene in the bar where all 7 women were getting toasted and giving to tips on what to do with Duke once they got home.  Fortunately Duke was there to be there designated driver.  I love HEA's  and this one had it in spades.  You can read them as they come out, but if you've never read this series before, start at the beginning so you know who all the characters and how they came to be a threesome."

0,"When I selected this Barbie doll and horse play set (based on the upcoming movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-Her-Sisters-in-A-Pony-Tale/dp/B00E95AEBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale</a>) to try, I didn't realize it was remote controlled (it appears to be the only Barbie horse so controlled so far), so this function came as a complete surprise, and once I figured out that it needed 4 AAA batteries not 2 (mentioned on the box of course but surprisingly not obvious in the battery installation instructions), it functioned exactly as it was supposed to.  Controlled either by the Barbie doll remote control or by forehead button when Barbie is riding (though depending on the play area you might be able to bounce Barbie's arm activated infrared signal off the wall and make it work that way), the horse walks, stops, bows, and recovers from the bow as intended.  In our experience the horse walking worked well on smooth flooring and thin carpeting, but not (obviously IMHO) on thick carpeting.  Restarting the horse after it enters sleep mode is a little tedious (holding the button down until something happens) but better than the alternative of running the batteries down.  I can see some definite additional play possibilities if and when they start making more of these remote control horses, especially if they speed them up a bit and add unicorns so that they can be made to ram into each other.  (When I mentioned this to my 9-year-old daughter, she raised an eyebrow, folded her arms, and said, ""Daddy...."", then picked up the horse and stalked off.)  Maybe it's another one of those differences between boys and girls things.  Note: This play set is one way to (start) acquiring horses and dolls for the otherwise horseless and doll-less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-and-Her-Sisters-in-a-Pony-Tale-RV-Vehicle/dp/B00C6PV4QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale RV Vehicle</a>, another remarkable toy in this line."

0,"My problem- I didn't check the dimensions. Smaller than I expected and wanted but as described-kinda. The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats. The outside pouch will not hold a tennis ball , for the size it will hold, that size is small enough to choke your dog. It does have an inside pocket about the size of a clicker. When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done. So, if you have a small dog with a small ball, tiny poop bag(s), and tiny treats then this bag is great for you! My dog is a 100lb Wht. G. Shep who likes to fetch a baseball bat and tennis balls. Oh well, my error not Amazon or the seller(description a bit misleading)...I have used the treat bag now and find it great for a lot of smaller treats for my dog and probably better and less costly than the larger treats he was getting. He doesn't care since I break the larger treats to smaller bites. The ball pocket..nah..use it for a bag or clicker. I like this purchase!"

It can dim down significantly before I notice flicker (and it's not that bad even then and no worse than most any other bulb). I don't hear any high-pitched noise from it like I have with some light bulbs when dimmer (I haven't scrutinized it that closely I suppose, but some lights are so noisy when dimmed that it's hard to ignore).  It's got a pretty wide angle and is as good or better in that regard to the halogen it replaced. I have one of these in the ceiling of a room about 8'x8' (which is fairly small) and it is easily sufficient for the whole room."

0,"I bought these in large, and to be honest I was a little worried because I've gained some weight and a large would have been my normal size. I'm 5'9 and weigh 170. However, the large was actually a little baggy in the legs! This was perfect for me, because I bought them to turn into shorts, but if I had wanted them to remain pants then I would have either needed a medium or to take the legs in. The waistband was perfect (my stomach is where my weight gain has happened), so they will make perfect shorts. I bought these in teal, and in my experience different colors of pants have different fits, so definitely find reviews for the color you are wanting if you are worried about fit."

0,"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere. What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor. The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts. Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them."

0,"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER. Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down. Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending. SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Rapture, The Devil's Backbone DON'T SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: Resident Evil, House on Haunted Hill, Ghostship."

1,"My husband and I recently went to Chicago for my Aunt's funeral. We are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town. We were told to stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. I wish we could say that our experience there was a good one, but sadly, it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had. Upon check in we were quickly shown to our rooms, but when we entered our king suite a very strong, musty smell greeted us on the other side. At first I thought I was just being sensitive, but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved. The smell was too overwhelming. The front desk said they would be happy to move us, but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds, rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved. While this was not exactly what we wanted, we didn't really have a choice to refuse. After transfering to the new room and getting settled, we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work. While this did not bother my husband too much, I was very annoyed, as I need the mirror while I use my hair dryer, curling iron, etc. I absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again, so I simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed. They also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom, so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels, BOTH DAYS we were there! Each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests. For what we paid to stay at this hotel, we were not impressed at all. The customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par. If you are ever in Chicago, do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else."

Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars. If you want a super durable knife, that is strong and American made, get an actual Ka-Bar. They are about the same price depending where you get it."

He is the last of the Assassins to come to the rescue of the Templars and the group is led by two Assassins, Deanna and Wilma.  Sir Gawain is one of the most important characters in the book and it is not just the Templars but the Brotherhood that is the main focus of the story.  Sir Gawain is the leader of the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood is the only group of Assassins to be killed in a single day"
0,This book was awesome. We meet two people with terrible pasts. They are having issues moving on. When they meet can they finally let there past go and accept the future before them ?
0,My high hopes were not achieved.  My feeling is even the mediocre reviews are overstated.  The movie is simply way to slow.  Virtually no action adventure going on.  I had envisioned something like the Three Kings movie.....not even remotely close.

0,"Our check-in was great, but then we got into our room. The carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower (open concept) leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it. The mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room. Our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect....1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize, and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine ($69 instead of $50). When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected, he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee. It was adjusted, but not without confrontation. There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same 'mysterious' mini bar charge on her bill as well, and was trying to have it corrected. Overall, the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,"

If there is any weakness to the presentation, I would have liked to know more about Welles' work in professional magic beyond the delightful snippets interspersed through the film. As a Welles fan, I found this documentary extensive, fast-paced, intersting, and very educational! Highly recommended!"
0,"At its best, this book is an amusing memoir about working as a presidential speechwriter, and a patriotic assessment of what government can do to help people. It doesn't always maintain that level though. List tells his story in roughly chronological order, but there isn't anything like a traditional dramatic arc here -- we get discussion of a good political thing, then a speech about infrastructure, a speech about correctional policy, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a bad political thing, a speech about health care, another White House Correspondents' Dinner, etc. Books by political insiders can be fascinating but Litt was not really an insider. Stories are fueled by proximity to power and to important decisions, but Litt never really got that. He shares with us some funny jokes, and these are the best part of the book. A collection of his favorite Obama humor might have worked better than the book we actually got.  Yes, we get the story of how Litt got his job in the White House, buffered by his assurance to the reader that he didn't really deserve the job and repeated apologies for being white (starting on page 40 when he gets an internship with West Wing Writers). Litt does have some nice turns of phrase in the book; I particularly liked his judgment that the president doesn't play chess, he plays whack-a-mole. Many famous people appear in cameos, including an unpleasant run-in with Harvey Weinstein that's a lot more interesting to read now than it would have been a month ago. The Republican party's weird love affair with Vladimir Putin starting in 2014 gets called out as well; I suspect we'll hear more about that over time.  The book is at its darkest when discussing early problems with the Affordable Care Act website. Was that really so terrible? I remember that it didn't work well, but I would have thought that the Democrats' midterm losses would have been worse, from the point of view of the White House."

0,"This product is made of great quality. The ice bowl is made of a heavy plastic and is great. The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl or any flaws that I could see. I was a little worried that it would leak but it does not and works very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled. The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part. So not only is this a great functioning product, but this works very well and looks elegant! I have had many compliments on this serving dish and I have referred many people to this bowl, I am over all satisfied with this product and this is just great and I couldn't be happier with this product. I can't wait to purchase a few more to give out for christmas gifts. I did receive this product for free to test and share my honest and fair opinion. Other experiences may vary."
0,"This is a cute idea, but it's not all that much fun. After the novelty wears off, there's not much to it. This is a miniature race track with these cars that you charge up, then let zoom around for a few laps.  It's kind of neat.  These teeny tiny cars - seriously there are as big as my thumbnail, have batteries and motors in them.  The set needs two double-A batteries to work; and you ""charge"" up the little car, then let it go flying around the track.  It's a little klunky, but kind of neat. Once the track is set, you place the car in the charging area and press a lever.  The lever sticks these two prongs into the back of the car.  The back of the car has 2 little metal pieces where the contact is made to charge the car.  Mine didn't work.  I had to fiddle with the wires in the back of the car but finally I was able to make contact.  When the car charges, it makes a little revving noise which is kind of neat.  Then you release the car, and it zooms around the track a few times.  It's cute.  It's also boring.  The novelty of one car wears off quickly.  This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it's not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It's pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could ""race"" them etc, but alone, it's pretty dry stuff. My nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.  At least it doesn't take up much space."

It is very comfortable. The material is soft, but I have to wear a small, since I don't want to wear a large. The material is a good thickness, but it is too soft.

0,"From the female of the family: This beautiful top is a lot more than a ""T-shirt."" It is simple, yet elegant. It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.  I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.  One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.  I've only come across the Royal Robbins brand recently and I think the quality and style of their lines are excellent.  Recommended."

0,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.  DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much."

1,Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar. The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room. I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. I didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. If my stay wasn't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated. The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online. I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.

0,"The Book of Illusions--being the story of the narrator's encounter with Hector Mann, a former silent filmmaker--presents quite a few passages where the narrator describes one of Mann's films.  As I was reading Auster's novel, I kept thinking I ought not to like the book so much.  After all, describing Mann's work seems patently second-hand--""telling"" in creative writing workshop language--and all the narrative commentary effectively takes interpretation out of readers' hands.  Yet, I could not put the book down.  The forthright prose and the resulting sincerity of the narrator won me over.  I didn't mind his being my eyes and ears.  Auster's movies seemed real.  While I didn't find myself watching the movies with him, he did make me want to watch them.  Narrators you care about can overcome any skepticism."

First off, I know a lot of people (ok not in the secret service), but I've never heard anyone talk like the female characters in this book. It feels like they had a photographic memory of a thesaurus when they speak and bring up ten cent words ever so often to let the reader know they're smart. And all the killing. I do believe there's some shady things that go on in this country, but I find it hard to believe all of those killings would happen under the radar. We have such a sensational media, they would be all over stuff like this! If you can get past those things, you have yourself a good read!"

0,"Number three in Brandilyn Collins' Hidden Faces series knocks out the theory that sequels will disappoint. Dead of Night is the best of them all and just about caused me to hyperventilate. Annie Kingston once again finds herself in a fight with evil. But this time, she has something she didn't have before. She has found the power of God.  Chilling, thrilling, and totally entertaining, this third book in the series seems to wrap up some things, but I'm not so sure. I think there is reason to hope for another book.  Buy this one. And if you haven't read the first two Hidden Faces books, buy them too. You'll be glad you did."

1,"The Sofitel Water Tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to Chicago. We got married in the city but then moved away, and it was so romantic to return. We loved how near the Sofitel was to everything - the Magnificent Mile was just outside our door, and we could walk to Navy Pier and other attractions as well. Chicago has changed, but the Sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. Both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in Le Bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us. But I have to say we have some new great memories now, thanks to the Sofitel Water Tower!"

I received one as a gift a few holidays ago, and decided to buy another myself to use for my climbing rope. It works perfectly for both uses, and neither of them has lost and strength or spring in the months that I've been using them. The padded grip of the side opposite the gate is a great addition as well.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make carry something, a little bit easier."

We have mostly Lego brand but have been frustrated that most of their sets because they are lacking just the basic blocks so our collection at this point has way too many specialty pieces. We were very happy with the base plates we purchased from Play Platoon so when we converted our train table into a Lego table so when we saw they sold collections of just bricks we were super excited!! This bag of bricks did not disappoint!  They worked perfectly with the Lego brand blocks and base plates we own. This pastel color collection is great for boys or girls. My son was excited because he said it had ""ice cream"" colors. Overall, we are very pleased and happy to have a great collection of bricks.  I was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

0,"We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any time."

0,"I thought this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was painful to watch this child being bullied by her drunken father. She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking. This child seemed like a half wild animal running through the swamp, screaming and shouting, and the filth...I just wanted to bath her, dress her in clean clothes and show her there is something better. Ugh, I really hated it!"

It works great to flatten bacon, and speeds up cooking burgers.  It fits well in a large pan or cast iron skillet.  Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.  My only complaint, the handle is on a screw, and loosens from time-to-time, requiring a few turns of a screwdriver to tighten back up.  Otherwise I like and recommend this press."

1,"Judith Kriger's ""Animated Realism"" really helps me understand the relationship between two women. The first couple of pages are about the two people, both of whom have a shared interest in religion and politics. They both have been in the same boat for years. This book is a great introduction to the two women. The second book, ""The Metamorphosis,"" is about the two women, both of whom have been married for 40 years. Both of whom have been very interested in religion and politics. They both have been very interested in politics, and they both have been very interested in their marriage. I like that the women have been in love for 40 years. They both have been married for 40 years, and they both have been very interested in their marriage. I think this book should be a little more of a look at the history of marriage. This is a great book."

0,"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.

1,"My stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live. I was there for a week long conference. Although my reservations had been made months in advance, they did not have a suite for me when I arrived, resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night. Once my room was ready, I was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen: barely large enough to move around, and very few utensils to cook with. The pool was only open for limited hours, and I should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit. At night I was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside. My overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite. I will not book here ever again."

1,"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.  The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.  The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.  Henry Ewing's father was very good at sports, but his mother was a bit too shy and a bit too violent.  In the movie, Ewing is a bit of a troublemaker who"

1,"*** This review may contain spoilers. Waking Up  by Charles Baxter  While the two have had a lot of fun together, the beginning of the movie is pretty much a family affair. It's a little more serious than some of the other Disney movies, but still a fun ride. The most memorable scene is when the kids are at school and the teacher tells them that there's nothing to do if they go to the library. They're not even allowed to go to the library. The teacher tells them that they can't go to the library if they're not allowed to go. So, they go to the library. The movie is a little too serious and the movie isn't at all realistic. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a realistic ending. The story line is pretty good. The ending is pretty much a joke. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where a story line is completely predictable. The movie is good. The acting is pretty good. The music is good. The acting is pretty good.

0,"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.  Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.  Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake."

The story is heartbreaking, complicated, yep, well named, pushes boundaries, (it's interesting) and hopeful. It's just the full emotional journey. Told from Liam's POV you can't help but be caught up in his story - he's been through so much - lied to, loved, hurt, broken, pieced back together...and loved again.  If you want vanilla. If you want boring, If you want predicatable, then don't read this book.  If, however, you want super sexy, a bit of kink, to be immersed in a story.

However, the plot holes and unscientific twists nagged at my enjoyment. Is it really that easy to hop from one station to another? And  spoiler alert  why in the world would George Clooneys character be compelled to let go???? No force, such as gravity, was acting upon him. All Sandra Bullocks character had to do was tug him to her and he would float back in her direction. Geesh. I just really didn't want his character to die."

Main character private eye Spenser a gritty no nonsense kinda guy. Starts with a valuable missing book and a young girl in trouble. Flows easily as plot thickens. Spenser likes his booze and sure does know the geography of Boston which would elicit plenty of images for a native of the area. Quick 200 page read which keeps the reader on focus and not lost is a lot of extraneous filler. Worthwhile read for a fan of this genre. I will look for more of the author's work on thrift shop shelves."

Naturally, fate has a sense of humor and brings these two co-workers together one day at the office.  Neither is aware that the other is anything more than human.  Anticipation is delicious!  I held my breath waiting for the moment when Truth dawned on them.

0,"I hate getting sweat in my eyes while running and biking, so I am always looking for a good solution. I had the Halo headband for two years and it worked okay in mild weather (70s), but in the middle of summer (high 80s and 90s) it would soak through quickly and let sweat in my eyes and down my nose. I finally got sick of it and found this. I like the idea, it looks stupid on me, but if it keeps the sweat out, great! It does, but the little hair tie looking things that come with it to size it are too different. The smallest one is tiny while the next size up is nearly four times the circumference. If I put the smaller one one it squeezes my head and make my forehead look purple, if I use the next size up it constantly slips down my head and lets sweat through (although less than a saturated Halo did). I am going to look around to see if I can find other options the little circular connectors. I love the concept of it and if I could get a good fit, I think it would be perfect."

YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE. OVERALL, GREAT VALUE FOR THE MACHINE...GREAT LOOK, GREAT FILTERS, GREAT CAPABILITIES! 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE LEAK ISSSUE THAT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK TO GET OVER..AND ALSO SIZE.

The building itself is maintained, however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill. And while the outside appearance is fine and dandy, my room 325, was repulsive. As soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room's ground and verbally demanded a tip, I noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around, the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement, before I could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled. Immediately I went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour, a complete waste of time, because as soon as I had reported my problem I was told that no other rooms were available and I would have to make do, they did however say I could stay the night free of charge. The next morning as I was set to leave I decided I would try the breakfast, in hopes of finding one redeeming quality. Let me tell you, that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold, the worst breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. Overall the employees are arrogant and callous, with the work ethic of a 2 year old child, they cannot cook, the room for me was poorly maintained, however they are good at refunding your money."

The only thing you need to be mindful of is when using for a length of time, the metal edges near the wood handle can get hot, and this is cast iron so it will stay pretty hot.  Highly recommend."

Sam finally gets tired of waiting and hauls his lady back home to Texas where they build on  their relationship. The story was great and fairly well done. The supporting characters were a nice touch. Typos still abound with words that are poorly chosen (always spelled correctly but the wrong word in the sentence) and things that don't make sense. The winner for this novel - a car that becomes a truck then goes back to being a car, like the transformers children play with but in this case I think the author forgot what kind of vehicle she had Sam driving. As usual, I liked this enough to suggest others make the purchase. My less than perfect rating is still due to the fact that a proofreader is truly needed. Enjoy."

I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my wife and she is thrilled with it. It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.

0,"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike."

0,"...there's a specific audience for this type of film; most people judge them by the wrong standards. This movie was made with the same rationale and in the same spirit as spaghetti westerns, which fared a whole lot better, but riding on the success of Mad Max and Escape from New York. You have to LOVE a movie which manages to throw in every conceivable creature in a single feature, -for the sake of maximizing whatever little resources available and also save the audience time and money watching them in separate entries-, even ninjas, ex-soft core stars, fishmen, apemen, telepaths, killer blind monks, werewolves, etc... and manages to anticipate the idea behind such movies as The Running Man, while attempting to be something else. This is a movie in its very own league, not to be judged by any other standards; actually Joe D'Amato's favorite among all the colorful entries in his immense catalogue. I reckon from seeing Death Smiles on a Murderer, that David Lynch's place in film history should have been occupied by him instead, but there was just no market for such a thing in the Italian industry back then. So, he went, ""if they want rubbish,  I have no problem delivering just that.."" and the rest is history.  Made in the truest Ed Wood spirit, taking into consideration the man was ""ahead of his time;"" certainly, their kingdom was not of this world... It's a rare privilege that this movie is available in the first place!"

1,"We all know or need to read the book, and I will admit that I have been tempted to buy it.  The book is a bit long, but it does take me a while to get into it.  I think it will be useful for people who are new to the world of books.  I also think it will be helpful to anyone who is a fan of the show or just want to learn more about the characters and their lives.  It's very easy to read and understand, and it's very interesting.  I highly recommend it."

Unfortunately, this is not the case. The one-chamber solution still works, but the one-chamber solution is the most convenient option. I would recommend this cable to anyone looking to get a new router or computer if you plan on upgrading from a old one."

He made up for me so not wanting to come along and be alone all weekend, with this wonderful hotel. His mother told him all about this hotel when she and her husband stayed here in the summer of 2008. She loved it..and so did I! I was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend, but the decor, wonderful staff and massages made up for it! I spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and couldn't have asked for a better experience! I am definately coming along on the next business trip!"
0,I am currently deployed and I was excited to receive these but when I did I was quite disappointed. The inside bottom sole of the right shoe is lifted from the bottom of the shoe and not fully glued on. I can lift half of it off. I'm nervous to wear these because I feel that the inside will get worn pretty fast and start sliding and coming out easily oppose to if it were made and glued down properly. I tried them on for a brief minute to see if the sizing was good and that was fine so no complaints there. Still not sure what to do with these. I'm really debating on sending them back but the process to do so from overseas is a little difficult.
0,"I remember the 12 inch Indiana Jones doll back in 1981 that was out for about a week, it seemed anyway. It was imposable to find then and I have been waiting for it for years! (Because I wouldn't pay the ridiculous price for it as time went by). Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down. Does anyone at Hasbro have the slightest clue how useless this feature is? It's a minor nuisance and overall it's worth owning though other companies are now making much better detailed versions of Indiana Jones in 12"" form."
1,This book was really fun and sweet and the characters were good.  There were a few typos and mistakes but the story kept going.

0,This works very well for us. We have a well and I worry about contaminates. The water tastes different after filtering. It tastes much better and cleaner. I have had well water most of my life but after moving to a different home the water did not taste good at all but this takes care of that. The water flow does slow down after about 6 weeks or so for us. We replace the filter every six to eight weeks. We have been using these for about 4 years now and will continue using.

1,"When I first jumped on this movie, I knew it was a lot of fun. I just wanted to see it again. I am glad that I did. This movie is very entertaining and it keeps my interest. Highly recommend it. I can't imagine what this movie would have been like if it had been released on DVD. I can't imagine the level of emotion and attention-grabbing violence that could have been put into it. The acting was excellent. I would not have given it five stars if it had been released on DVD. I'm not sure why the producers didn't make it more than five. I have watched it a few times and I'm not sure how they ended up making it three stars."
0,"I hate it because it arrived broken, and to get a replacement or refund I have to return it.  It was $17 - not worth my time to take it to UPS or the post office so I'm tossing it.  Bad quality control.  I have no idea if it would work and I probably won't find out."

1,Great book. It's probably for the most part an exercise in class. There is a lot of time spent reading.
1,"Entering the theater today I saw a movie with the same name.  This is a movie that is a little too old for the age of the video, but it is a very entertaining movie.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an old-fashioned adventure movie.  It is a must see for any movie lover.I didn't think this was going to be a great movie.  I was expecting more.  I expected a good, thoughtful story that could have been told about a very interesting subject.  I'm not sure why I was so disappointed.  The acting was okay, but the story was not convincing.  The movie had a lot of clichs and was a bit too ""raw"".  I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a good story, but this movie didn't seem to be that bad.  I don't really know what the problem was with the movie.  I was hoping to see more of the ""real"" version of the movie.  I guess it was supposed to be a story about a real person.  It seemed like it was going to be about a couple of men who get into a gang of robbers in a beautiful city.  It was a bit cheesy at times but it was a good story that could have been told about a guy who is a pretty good actor."

I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING... Before you buy any Foodsaver product make sure you contact Foodsaver and find out if they are going to warranty that particular model at the time you are buying it!!!!!"

The edge is very well made and the handle is a very thick stainless steel with a sharp edge.  I love it.  I have the option of a medium-sized version with a strong edge.  I just can't get enough of this knife for my needs.  It's very well made and it is very light weight.  The handle is very nice and comfortable.  I just wish that it was more adjustable.  I have used it a couple of times and it seems to hold up very well.  I would definitely recommend this knife for those of us who are not concerned with pocket knives."

0,"Bought by Nicolette Hugo  Designation: Standalone, 302 pages  Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.  The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.  Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.  So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.  There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.  *REVIEW STARS* Hero: Killian 5 stars, Jerricho 5 stars Heroine: Scarlet 5 stars Steam Level:5 stars Plot: 4.5 stars Overall: 5 stars Cliffhanger: no  I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book."

0,"This documentary presents a chilling account of the horrors of war (WWII and Vietnam) and a superb insight into the lessons learned from these wars. It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes. With nukes scattered across the globe, our learning-from-mistakes curve has been reduced to a single dot; make a mistake and you won't live to learn from it."

0,"Like ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE, another recent bestseller that left me cold, I found STATION ELEVEN too (self)-consciously crafted, too mannered, to enjoy. I was never able to escape into the story; the writing, gorgeous as it was, always kept me at arm's length, reminding me that I was reading, well, gorgeous writing. (The plot was pretty predictable too; how many ""virus-ends-the-world"" narratives do we need?) This is not a criticism of the author's abilities, but I personally enjoy novels that are a bit less polished, novels that allow me to forget the craft and lose myself in the story. It's a fine line, I'll admit--too little craft calls attention to itself as surely as too much. But there is a balance, and for me, this novel didn't achieve it."

1,"Reviewed by Robin Book provided by the author  Rating: 4  Reviewed by Robin  Rating: 4. 5 stars  What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written. There is a lot of sex and love in this book. I would recommend it."

0,"I'm not the best at doing any kind of organized crafts with my children. My style is more along the lines of giving them art supplies and letting them create what they want, and honestly, that's what I'll always prefer for them. They really enjoy projects that have a somewhat defined end result sometimes, though, and so it's kits like this that come to my rescue. Thankfully, they still get to be a bit creative with these projects, and while end results might look similar for many children, they probably won't look just alike.  There are 16 projects within this box, with lots and lots of little pieces. There are only instructions for 5 of the projects, but really, with those instructions, you can easily figure out the rest of them. I would have preferred for each of the projects to have been individually packaged to make things easier. I have had kits like that, and they make things a breeze for this disorganized mama. This kit does need a bit more organization on my part, but it's really not that bad. The supplies are all separated into different bags, and there are even extra bags for me to divide out some of the supplies. I could turn my children loose with everything and see what they come up with, but I prefer separating each project(at least for the most part), so that my children can choose which one they want to do, and not worry about running out of supplies before all the project are finished. Between my 3 children, I'll get 5 rainy days out of this box, with one extra. (I can't beat that!) ;) Plus, the included finger crayons can be used after all the projects are finished.  This is a really nice box of crafts. Especially if you're like me, and don't do so well with organized crafts, this is an excellent way to give your children some fun with crafts."

0,"This was a fun set to build, with many authentic automotive mechanical details like working CV joints, differentials, and suspension.  Looks wise, this is one of the meanest looking vehicles Lego has ever offered; in person it really looks formidable and the metallic decals really add to the curb appeal.  The final model is solidly-built and cool to drive around and watch the various moving parts do their job."

0,"Summer is a good time to sit back, chill out, and pick up a romance novel or two.  Its not taxing.  The light reading stirs up memories of our own youthful days and is a welcome holiday for the brain.  Unlikely Love was a good choice.  Three sisters return to their childhood home to attend their father's funeral.  Estranged from each other and their father for many years, they are pleasantly surprised at the transformation of the Bed and Breakfast from ramshackle to opulent resort.  They are to inherit this new found wealth ... or are they?  There are conditions, complications, and a good dollop of romance laced with suspense, to say any more would be a giveaway.  It's a page turner good for a quick read under the shade of a tree."

0,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.  This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.  So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set."

It is a pain to assemble. This was a big hit. The first time I put it together, the pieces were all over the place. I think the quality of the pieces is great.

1,"My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I'll never ever forget - not in a good way. Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. I went up to my room and looked around, all seemed ok at first. I was bushed so I flopped on the bed... ohhhhh noooooo! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days. But I was so tired that I just passed out. Of course I woke up with a back ache...great. I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub, turned the hot water on full force, and poured in some shower gel. I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. I called the front desk but they were no help, the clerk just apologized. Frustrated at this point, I turned on the tv and switched on the air. I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent. It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. I couldn't take anymore of this. I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized, no empathy as if he's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. He offered me a free night but there is no way that I'd stay at this place again - ever."

0,"My MacBook Pro gets hot. I have to run it with a cooling fan or it will start slowing down. (In order to keep itself from overheating, Macs manage the temperature by adding more idle processes into the queue until it's cooled down!)  I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).  When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.  This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.  Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.  BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point."

It is identically sized, and seems to have the same filtration capabilities (or darn close) to the actual Honeywell product.  I'll order this again, and feel confident in suggesting that you give it a chance."

0,"I was excited to purchase these due to the pretty colors offered and the reviews posted. The first time I went to use them though, I regretted my decision. They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed as the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to."

0,"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.  Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.  I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.  The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes."

No wonder an illustration is shown not an actual image of the item.  I will add my own.  I thought the bottom portion would be a beautiful chrome.

I did love the way it will stay in the spray mode, you don't have to keep pulling down on the fitting to move it from solid flow to spray time after time like you do with all the others on the market.  Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.  BUT - lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.  I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!  Ka Boom!"

0,"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.  Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.  Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.  The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.  However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products."

0,"I am so impressed with this Micro SD Adaptor.  Not only it fits in my Dell XPS15, 9560, but it is very well made.  It is much more expansive than other micro SD adapters.  The card is little bit shorter (about 0.5mm) than the depth of the SD card slot (see attached photo) because it is not made for the XPS15, 9560, but it is not a problem.  There is no problem removing it from the laptop with you finger nail.  The manufacturer is not planning to make a custom fitting card adapter for the new Dell XPS15, 956-0, so you have to settle for this adapter if you are looking for flush fitting Micro SD Adapter.  When buying this adapter, make sure to get the right model (103A).  The other models made by BaseQi are either too short or too long or do not fit at all. Prior to buying this, I bought a very inexpensive plastic adapter, and it destroyed the SD card slot's internal card contacts on the first try.  I had to replace the laptop motherboard to correct the damaged card slot.  Yes, the card reader slot is embedded on the motherboard, so there was no other solution but replacing the entire motherboard.  Yes, it was an over $1,000.00 mistake.  You get what you pay for. I am very happy with this product."

Unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, The Sofitel would surely have it. My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago, one would hardly want to leave. Fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave."

0,"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.  Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.  They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.  This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.  A highly recommended read.  Read and Reviewed voluntarily for Reading Is Our Satisfaction Blog  FIVE STARS."

I finally have a machine that holds the blade tightly and is easy to thread into pilot holes.the blower works great. Having the arm tilt is an invaluable feature for me. I am not crazy about the hold down...the arms are too far apart for some of the small work I do. But other than that, a fantastic machine, and getting the stand free is a great incentive. A built in light and blade holder would nice added features.  I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw. It's outstanding to operate. Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do. I like the extra long air hose on the saw; it does a nice job of keeping the work area clear of dust when cutting and it adjusts easily. This saw also runs very smoothly and quite.

0,"I am a fan of Doreen Owens Malek, her dialogue is witty and she steadily builds the romantic tension between her leads. Her novel, A Marriage of Convenience, is an enjoyable read albeit this is an older novel and there is a sense of the characters being behind the times in many ways.  Sharon Phillips returns to her father's ranch in California after his death, she is not happy to be in the Golden state though because she must face her first love, Taylor Braddock. Sharon fell in love with Taylor when she was only eighteen when she visited her father for his wedding to Taylor's mother. Taylor broke her heart and she has not been in contact with him since.  Taylor is a Vietnam vet (yes, this is dated) and he has had major difficulties adjusting back into civilian life. He was a POW and he deals with his memories with alcohol and a bad temper. He is about ten years older than Sharon and he finds her sweet and innocent, way too innocent for the likes of him so he sends her on her way making her believe that she is way too young for his jaded tastes.  Ten years later the two are forced to confront their feelings because Sharon's dad has bequeathed the ranch to the both of them but they must marry to inherit. They decide to go through with a marriage with plans to annul it fairly quickly but Sharon realizes her feelings for Taylor have not gone away.  This novel deals with some big issues like post traumatic stress, loneliness and fear. Taylor is very complex and he is hurting. His transformation from an angry young man to a mature businessman is believable. Sharon is not as interesting as Taylor (how could she be, she's a run-of-the-mill lawyer in Philadelphia) but she is generous and it is her giving heart that makes such a difference in Taylor's life."

1,"Don't ever stay at this hotel!, Conrad Chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine. First of all, THE PRICE! you not get what you pay for. I paid &217.50 one night for a room that did not even had a TV!! that's ridiculous! The bathroom did not work, and it was nasty! the bed sheets seemed like used, as if some people slept there and they smelled bad! After my experience with Conrad Chicago, I will please ask you to reconsider getting a room in this hotel. You get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel!"
0,These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.

0,"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.  The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.  I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.  The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.  I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.  I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
0,"a lot of the reviews say the consistency is too dry, i was a bit hesitant to buy it after reading that... but i went ahead and purchased this type because i was on a budget and its $10 cheaper than the venison and sweet potato pack. received it today and both of my dogs devoured it. i was feeding them chicken soup for the puppy lovers soul wet food mixed with 1/4 cup dry chicken soup dog food (was still using up the puppy cans, both dogs are on to adult food now) and that stuff smelled like canned dog food. nothing special. they ate it and it didn't make them sick... but i wanted something better and preferably grain free. ran out of the wet the other day before making this purchase and substituted with a scoop of pedigree puppy formula wet food and pretty much within 5 minutes after finishing eating my boy was throwing up. scrapped that can. this stuff smells ALMOST like human food, you can see the potato chunks in it, wich i didn't think were too overbearing, my dogs love potatoes so its not a problem anyways. so far, so good. its been about an hour and neither one has puked.  as for the dry consistency, its not really an issue for me since i just use the wet to entice them to eat their dry food. my boy dog will not eat plain dry kibbles, period. he really seemed to enjoy this stuff."

The story was well told and the characters were well developed. This book is still one of my favorite books. I have read the book 3 times and have loved it. I really enjoyed it and will continue reading it. I was not disappointed. I have always been a fan of Robert Langdon's books, but I thought this was a bit too predictable. I just didn't get it. As a writer, I was a little disappointed. I liked the ending, but I did not like the way the author left things out of the story. I guess it was a little too predictable, but it was not the best book I've read in a long time. I really enjoyed the book. It's a quick read."
0,"Punch-Drunk Love is a decent movie with a sweet romance. It was slightly disappointing in that the whole movie seemed to hint at something more. I wholly expected a bit more character development, a bit more action (not in the ""Action Movie"" sense, but just in the ""get off your butt and do something"" sense), and a bit more resolution to the story. It seemed like the most interesting aspects of the story and the characters was only hinted at, and we never got to see them up close. It seemed like so much more could have been done with Barry's family, the love story, and virtually everything else in the movie. Not bad, just not nearly as good as it could have been."

They're just a tad narrow and I can't tell you how they feel until I wear them. Overall, I'm very pleased with the boots. I really love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit like a glove! I love the way they look! I ordered a size 8, and they fit perfectly. I love the color, too.

We had a small dog and it was a perfect size for him. He has large ears and the straps are very tight so it's easy to get the dog's ears open without damaging them. I just put the straps on him and it is easy to put on and off. The material is very soft and comfy, so I will buy again. This is a great product. My dog has a lot of hair that doesn't fall out of her. It is a very good product for keeping hair in a place. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. He's a little hard to pull off the leash but he doesn't mind it. It was very well made and was easy to put on. I would recommend this for anyone who has a small dog."

0,"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.  It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.  I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending. I would encourage the writer to write more as her style of writing is definitely very good and I did enjoy the opportunity to read this book. I would read her work again!"
1,"I was very disappointed with this hotel. I have stayed in other Swissotels and enjoyed them very much, but the service can only be described as aloof. There was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure, and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information I had given her minutes ago. Precise, indeed. Room service took forever to pick up (good sign in a way=busy because they are good), but the food arrived very late and very cold. The man tried to replace it, but than took another hour, and I was never given a price reduction, free dessert, or anything to apologize. As for cleanliness, they must be next to godly, as they knocked on my door at 0800, despite the fact I had a doorknocker requesting no service (I'm a late sleeper.) Very disappointed with my stay. This hotel clearly did not help build the chain's reputation."

0,"The popular British World War II detective series ""Foyle's War"" returns for an encore performance with Set Six and three new episodes set in the months following VE Day.  Michael Kitchen returns as Detective Christopher Foyle, still Chief of the Hastings Police Station but awaiting his relief.  Honeysuckle Weeks is back as Foyle's former driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart, now demobilized with a new job and a new relationship.  Anthony Howell is Detective Milne, just promoted to head of the nearby Brighton Police Station and negotiating an unfamiliar relationship with his former boss.  The new episodes are excellent, with hard-hitting historical context.  Detective Foyle has lost none of his passion for justice, while the return of peace hasn't done away with crime.  In ""The Russia House"", the search for a missing Russian POW turns into a complicated murder mystery with national security implications.  Foyle must deal with the intelligence services, a White Russian refugee organization, and a shameful wartime secret.  In ""The Killing Time"", the presence of African-American GI's at Hastings triggers a spate of racial prejudice.  A crime attributed to one of the GI's turns into a complex mystery.  In ""The Hide"", a newly retired Foyle, awaiting a long-cherished trip to the States, gets involved in the strange case of a British traitor who refuses to defend himself at trail.  The details of the case connect to a murder and an unexpected skeleton in Foyle's own closet.  The ending of the stories nicely accounts for the series leads without foreclosing the possibility of future reunions.  ""Foyle's War: Set Six"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series."

Example: he swimmed across the river and leant into the wind (shorter paraphrase) I would write as he swam across the river and leaned into the wind. For some reason that kept bugging me.

Although it may be harder for a male to admit, we also can be hurt and severely wounded emotionally by our spouse. With that being said, I was a little cautious about purchasing this book only because it is written by a female and I feared it would only be targeted to the female perspective.  Boy, was I wrong! This book was written for females and males equally. As a man reading this book I never felt like the author wasn't talking specifically to ME. Since the author went through these experiences herself, you can tell that she wrote from the heart and can empathize with everyone of her readers. It's almost as if I am listening to a close friend or family member offering me heartfelt as well as straight to the point, detailed instructions on how to overcome, move on with your relationship, and heal. I will definitely be recommending this book to any family and friends who share a similar experience."

0,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?  I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.  Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.  I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.  Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much.

The rooms were way over priced, and the service was less than satisfactory. At one point, I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up, and when room service came through, they were still there! On the other side of things, the cup I had left on my desk (which I was planning to use later) was gone. My coffee and my towels were also never replaced. I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room. Rather, it was a 'nominal fee'. After paying so much for a room, I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi.

0,"No words will ever do this book justice, but I will try. This series is officially my new favorite series-and I have read A LOT. It is the greatest love story I have ever read. Kingsley, Soren and Nora have so much love, trust and devotion for each other. It may not be typical, and you really need an open mind for this book, but their love is so amazing. Never before have I finished reading a series and felt that I knew characters so completely. Nora is, by far, my favorite female character in a book. She is everything a female protagonist should be, but authors rarely get right. I'm probably rambling with this review, so if you're still reading it stop and buy this book.  Oh and read the books in order. Anyone who tells you otherwise is ridiculous. Read them in order, then go back and read book 1 again. Once you know these characters so intimately (and if you read all 8 books, you will), it is like reading it for the first time."
0,"This is the same story as Jag but from Roxy's POV. There is a lot that you learn about Roxy and why she is the way she is. It really awesome to see things from her POV which made for a more well rounded story. She really is a strong person and I really admire her. Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple. I loved how raw and emotional the story line was. It felt like it could be one of those documentaries about a real life situation. I felt deeply invested with the characters and hoping for a good outcome. It's definitely not for those that like all the flowery words and a perfect story because it's far from that. But in it's own way it is perfect because of all they both had to endure. I absolutely loved this book and I can't wait to read about the other band members. 5 out of 5 stars!"

0,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."

0,"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!  Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.  Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)  I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.  That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.  Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing."

0,"Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.  I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.  Good things:  - Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made - They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish - They both work as they should, and well  Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):  - Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste - Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard - I wish the mouse had rubbery sides - I wish the keyboard had a power switch  In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard."

0,"Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.  LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.  The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems."

I was expecting something that had everything going in a very predictable way. I was expecting to learn something new about the people in this book. I was expecting something that had me laughing out loud at how things were going to end. This book was not as good as the previous books in the series, but I"

0,"So glad I bought this.  Went on vacation and came back at night time on a rainy day.  My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.  If I didn't have this my only choice would have been to call a plumber late at night on a Friday and pay ridiculous fees for an emergency visit."

This is a very good buy.I had this on hand for a couple of years. I was looking for something that would fit my Makita DeWalt 11-volt drill and I was not disappointed.  This is a good tool for the money and I can't complain.  I have a Makita 12V drill and this is the one I have.  I use it everyday for maintenance, drilling holes in wood and building electrical boxes.  I have used it for a couple of years now and it is working just fine.  I would recommend it to anyone.

I bought it to get over the $150 special financing requirement and fell in love with it. Not for every one but it sure can save some weight if you drag tools all day."

1,"My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had! The location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! The lobby area is beautiful as was my room. In the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels. My only gripe was the room was a little dark. Sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. The service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. The room service took a bit longer than I would have liked, however, the food was good quality. Another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the Equinox Fitness Center. Finally, the location is PERFECT!! It's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast, which has many very good restaurants. A personal favorite of mine is Mario's, a nice Italian place nearby. Overall, my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were, for the most part, insignificant."

0,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.  Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.  My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."

0,"Let me start off by telling you that this story is not your typical romance story. Is it even possible to be able to find romance between an addict and a former addict ? In this story there are quite a few dark moments that have you holding your breath and praying and hoping for the best. What I loved about this story is that it provides you with the past and present time so you can fully understand what happened in Teagans life that got her to that moment. You start to understand Teagan more, or at least I did.  I thought this story was very well done. I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was. It was a very good book, even through its dark moments and because of its dark and raw moments in time"

Chloe, is very cute character (my favorite), the author writes a delightful dialogue for her (however, she should have been petit and not tall). The story is as mentioned before, too short but it is stimulating. There are too many excerpts from other stories from the author and I personally think excerpts are stupid and a waste of time."

I haven't had the chance to watch an 4K content as of yet, but I'm sure it will be amazing. This is my third Samsung TV, and they last and have great picture quality.

0,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."
0,"Patience! That is what most people will need to remember when reading this book. It's a beautiful love story that transcends the corporeal world, but this concept is very difficult to embrace in the Western world (or at least for me and most of my classmates) since the two lovers rarely interact. However, the poetry that love evokes within Majnun is beautiful and worth spending time on. Frankly, the second half will be more dynamic than the first half, so stay with it and it'll be worth it."

0,"While Case intends their knives to be pocketknives, they have the quality and look of a fine collectable. The Stockman model gives you 3 good blades of varying size and shape.  The large version weighs an ounce and a half more than the medium size and is 5/8 of an inch longer.  The additional size and weight can pull your pocket out of shape.  The amber bone  has an excellent hand feel and is a joy to hold. The blades are very sharp. Stainless steel will require less care to keep rust away but still hold a good edge. A Case knife is a possession to be treasured that will be with you for years. Case is an investment in a quality knife that will become a life-long friend.  In a world of cheaply made knives from overseas, American made Case is a beacon of quality. For over one hundred years, this company produced quality knives. This knife will sharpened to a fine edge for years and will hold that edge under repeated usage."

0,"We were encouraged to stay at the Affinia as part of a group in town for a Chicago wedding. We booked our rooms 6 months in advance, with the promise of a brand-new, full service hotel in a great locaiton in Chicago. The lobby was non-existant (under construction). The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful. The hallways and elevators are small, cramped and uncomfortable. The rooms are great - great beds, great television set. NO ROOM SERVICE - the kitchen is under construction. The bottom line is that during our stay, this was NOT a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did. We were totally disappointed, hope it will improve, but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of Chicago's truly amazing hotels. It is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal."

Frequency will not immediately destroy your device, but will definitely shorten its life.  Device input power requirements should be on the cord or where it plugs into the body."
0,"The waste king was a huge pain for me to install, basically because I couldn't get my head around how to twist the unit into place, for whatever reason.  I'm really happy with the product considering it was about $100.  It completely owns everything I put down there. It can handle chicken bones just fine, although I probably should stop putting those down there."
0,This is another product where the marketing tells a story that is better than the product itself.  This product isn't the highest quality and our kids really don't use it.  Don't get me wrong.  It's ok for some water play outside but the hand pump is pretty flimsy.
0,"Greatly diappointed. Post was cracked, no attachment provided for the upper mast, and the method for the ""no digging"" installation was beyond pathetic. After putting it all together and installing it, I could push it over easily. The area around the stake was solid and firm, but there was just no stability what so ever in this design."

1,"I got this for my daughter. She loves it. It is very cute and the material is very soft. I had to get a size down but the waist is a perfect length. The color is beautiful and the material is very thin. I wish it was a bit thicker. The material is a bit stretchy but the length is good. The material is very soft and I love it. I would buy it again. This dress is really cute. I received it in a very nice box. I would highly recommend it. I love these, they fit true to size. I ordered a medium and it fits perfect. The material is soft and comfortable. I am very happy with them. I got a small and it fit perfectly, the only reason I did not order a large is because the sole is pretty thin. I was going to buy a larger size, but I was too afraid to do that because I didn't want to look like a toy. I am very disappointed and will be returning it. The material is soft and comfortable. The color is exactly as I expected. I'm very pleased with the purchase and was very happy with the purchase."

0,"Others have detailed the historical inaccuracy of Baa Baa Black Sheep while praising the portrayal of the air war in the South Pacific during WWII. The reason I love this show so much is because I watched it with my grandfather during its original NBC run back in the 70's. My ""Pappy"" was a veteran (6th Marine Division) of the fighting in the South Pacific and watching Baa Baa Black Sheep would always prompt him to share some of his war stories with me. As a historian, I must criticize this program for its distorted view of the real VMF-214 but as the grandson, I love this show because it will always remind me of my now deceased ""Pappy."

0,"This CPU was too fast.  Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.  I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?  But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.  To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.  In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not."

0,The great charcoal for a typical aquarium and value priced. However don't use it on low pH aquariums like Tetra's or Discus as if you have the pH adjusted down this will raise it. I soaked it for a week and rinse before and after the soak to help prevent the pH change but it happened anyway.

0,"It should have worked, because It's a fun idea, but it falls painfully flat. It's hard to imagine Michael York as a serious seducer for one, and two, Angela Lansbury gives a performance that suggests that she is on a stage. It was a box office disaster, and you can see why. Harold Prince was a great stage director in his prime, unmatched really, but his two efforts into film, this and the appalling mess he made of 'A Little Night Music' revealed that he just didn't know what to do with the camera, or how to direct actors for film. Someone should turn it into a musical. I think it could work really work."

0,"First let me start off and say I hate serial books. Totally hate them. However I did bite at Entwined for two reasons. One, it was free. Second, it was a Tarzan and Jane book. I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.  I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.  The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.  Couldn't go wrong for a free purchase but the carrot that was dangled in front of my face at the end did not entice me to move on to the next book."

0,"This is a very bright light that is marred by an oversimplified design on the elastic cord that hold the lights in place. But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.  This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need. I'm something of an Energizer/Duracel loyalist (I find the two brands to be almost indistinguishable from one another and I will continue to use both this and Duracel products, but this isn't one of Energizer's stronger products."

Usually I buy a 20-30mmhg but on the advice of my cardiologist, I ordered this pair of X-LG.When the product arrived the box, like the picture was marked XL (which I have been buying for 4 years now based on my doctor's prescription). This pair of TRUFORM like the others I have bought in the past did not have a SIZE tag in them.

The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.  Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.  The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.  I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.  I will be picking up the other books in the series shortly."

I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction.This is a great movie to watch with family. The characters are very funny, and the action scenes are just awesome. The only thing I would say is that the story is not too long. It takes about 20 minutes to watch it. I would recommend to any family.Very good story. Very good for a family movie.

It not only brings an entirely new ergonomics to the camera (for the better) but adds several more controls enhancing it's professional use to say the least. But build is like Fort Knox perfection. NO gaps and it's solid as a rock once installed. I prefer to use the battery access on the grip altogether than bother with removal to install in the main body. The grip is a HUGE enhancement and you always feel like it's locked in your hands allowing for lower shutter speed shooting as well. If you have a OMD ""Just Get It"" and don't look back"

Joyce's grandmother is diagnosed with it.  The young doctor is handsome and interesting, and after his visits with grossmammi he visits with Joyce and they get to know each other.  Many things happen with dealing with this disease; some very sad, some a bit scared, and some happy.  Very good story and definitely worth reading."

I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a calf. I like that they are not too tight and have a little stretch on the inner thighs. I am 5'4"", 165lbs and these are perfect!  I would definitely recommend these shorts to anyone. This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as I was expecting it to be, but it is thin enough for me to wear in the holster. It is very well made and feels great."

I have noticed that my cat does not cover his feces with the pellets very well though, and I must clean up immediately after he goes. I am not sure if this is due to the product or not, because he covered them better with pine shavings and gravel used before. Perhaps he doesn't like the feel of the pellets in his toes? I feel this product is a good buy for the price, and if you are looking for a more environmentally friendly option it is good. I would not use this with many cats, unless they each have their own box."

Also a lot of information of whether the child is autistic or ADD  is around and this list helps the people get out of the ""autistic"" mindset which can potentially affect the children and the parents when wrongly informed of the same.

0,"Without repeating everyone else, let me say you get great value for what you pay.  It's classy, comfortable, and shiny - and looks like it's going to stay that way. It lives up to the 'comfort fit' label by being comfortable, sliding on easy and staying on.  Its not white gold or platinum but it looks just as nice and so is the price. And at this price, you never have to worry about losing or breaking it. This will likely be my daily wear ring. Buy it now while the price is right!  Update: May 7, 2015 The ring remains intact but it has been prone to scratches. I recommend removing the ring prior to doing any kind of work with it (dishes, gardening, woodshop, etc.) Otherwise it's still a nice ring for the price."

0,"There are some things I like about this product and some I do not.  As with most tools models, brands, quality, what the tool is being used, cost and other things make a buying decision.  This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.  Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.  But then I prefer top of the line tools, they usually pay you back in useability, durability and quality of work.  But then this drill may be ok for you.  I really cannot say I had problems with the battery kicking out, but then that is me.  I put this tool somewhere in the middle for quality and cost.  Time will tell on the durability.  So I give it 3 stars."

The leash is very noticeable- a reflective neon green (like what road workers wear) which is great when walking early morning/evening/night. My dog loves to lunge which creates more PSI on the leash, and this holds up to her exuberance."

Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.  I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!  When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.  I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef!

0,"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters."

She was a little disappointed when she opened it.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because she can't hold the pieces in her hands.  I was able to find some pieces that she could hold with her hands.  I think she'll love it.  I recommend this toy to anyone who is looking for a toy to hold in their hands.I love this game.  I was very pleased with the price.  The story is very well told and the characters are well written.

So I went on line and saw this package.  Let me say that it is AWESOME!  It looked brand new.  There was no visual signs of any prior use.  Other than ""Inspected by 3-1"" stickers on everything you would think it was brand new.  I have used over 4000 Finish Nails, and over 2500 Finish nails since it arrived (I haven't used the stapler yet).  It has performed flawlessly.  I am so glad I got it.  It is a great value!"

Jenna Bennett is an outstanding writing and she proves it once again with this first book in a new series, Fidelity Investigations. Gina Kelly thinks that realizing that her husband might have tricked her out of getting any money in their pending divorce is the worst thing that could ever happen to her; least that is was she thinks until he is murdered and she becomes the prime suspect.  Gina is not an investigator, but she has already been following her cheating spouse and that woman with great success for all the good it did.  Now she turns her attention to figuring out who could have killed the jerk and tried to frame her.  After all she is the most obvious suspect and she knows she didn't do it."

Turns out there are lots of ways, everything from the Bates Method, which was something an ophthalmologist from 1890 came up with to help work the muscles of the eye, to Yoga exercises. There is one technique that I like called a Color Day and you spend one day in finding one particular color of your choice, and you simply notice that color the whole day."
0,"I picked the ""Small"" size. For the review I chose ""Fits as expected"" but that's not EXACTLY true. The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.  The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.  The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.  The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.  I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).  Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable. Has ties to make it a bit smaller, a nice little hood that doesn't fall over my eyes, the fleece is super soft and comfortable and made me noticeable warmer in a cool room. Has on inside pocket on your left side. Very solid product especially for the price."

1,"To be honest I was a little disappointed with the quality of the product, but I was pretty impressed with the quality. The plastic parts are solid and the plastic part looks great. The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike."
0,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

0,"What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.  edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension."

0,"This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.  The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.  While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike."

However, they love them so much they chew and chew to get to the marrow and my daughter's dog ended up with 2 fractured top molars.  She was at my house and said Maggie wasn't chewing on the bone anymore and every once in a while she'd give a cry, like something hurt her.  I looked in her mouth and her teeth didn't look bad but one was definitely broken in the back.  She took her to the vet the next day and now they have a huge dental bill to pull the teeth.

I took the holster out of the holster and used the button to release it.  The next time I use it I will see if it would work with the one-handed release.  I will update the review after I have received the holster.  Update:  I have now used it for two weeks"
0,"Season Four is the greatest season so far and was pretty steady all the way through.  The Car Pool Lane is probably the greatest episode so far, right up there with season 2's The Doll.  The laughs just keep on coming with Larry offending everyone including Jews, Muslims, blind people, mentally retarded people, Holocaust survivors and Hasidic Jews.  Of course, he always suffers for his behavior but then always comes alright in the end."

1,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  It is easy to install and does the job.
1,Bought this for my Zojirushi (Coffee) and I'm very happy with the purchase. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use. The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small. This is why I ordered this for the price. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I think it is a good quality product. I just wish the lid was a little wider to hold more coffee. It's very easy to open and close the lid. You can see the coffee inside the lid and it's not just the coffee that's inside but the beans that are inside the lid. I can't say enough about how I like this product. I got a second one for my daughter to use when she's in her first year of college and she loves it. I have used it

1,"Although I have steered away from the book as a result of its boring title, I was disappointed.  I had hoped for a solid story with the beginning of the story, but that was not the case.  The main character was a bit too young for my liking.  I felt like she was a bit too familiar with the military system and didn't know how to deal with it.  This book felt like a waste of my time.  It lacked a lot of depth and depth of character development.  The main character was too much of a let"

1,"I don't want to spoil it for you guys, but I will say that I think this book is a very good read. I liked how the characters seemed to have a great rapport and that it was well written. I would definitely recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. I love a good mystery with a good twist. I have read a lot of Nora Roberts books. I have read all of her books and am looking forward to reading a few more of her books. I loved the ending and the way the author moved the story along. I was looking forward to the next book. I really enjoyed this book. I read it to my son, and I loved it. I also read it to my daughter who was a bit concerned about what happened in the story."

These treats are great, not very big but they pack a punch of nutrition and the dogs go crazy for them. All the flavors are great but if your pet is sensitive to a certain protein there is a flavor for you so feed with confidence."

0,"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...  First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.  Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.  Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...  Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.  *dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time."

Certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great. But, the room was not well cleaned, a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that I left in the room. The hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service. I noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel. I know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this. Overall, Chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not. Stay else where."

0,"Best locking clutch i've encountered. The price deterred me from purchasing one of these for about a year, particularly since the non-locking clutches are noticeably cheaper. But I'm in love with how well this secures my bike. Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own. Although solid, the price is still a lot for a locking clutch, especially if you want to purchase two to transport multiple bikes, which why i'm giving it four stars."

1,"When a murder-mystery fiction involving a serial killer with a serial killer history becomes one of the top-grossing thrillers in the world, I can't help but think this is a great book to read.  It's a murder mystery that can be solved with only a few clues.  It's a great read, and I recommend it highly.I was so happy to see the first book in this series! I love the characters and their story line! It's very refreshing to have a new author get to read the series. I liked the first one so much! I read the second one after reading the first one. I was a little disappointed with the first one. I'll be reading the third one to see what happens next. I think the fourth one is awesome! I love the way the books move the story forward.

0,"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke."
0,"Of the 6573 toys my daughter received for her first birthday, this is by far both her and my favorite. Sure, it doesn't sound like a night at the symphony, but it's a toy. It has amused both my daughter and her friends (12-month-olds), and our 3-year-old niece for 10 or 15 minutes at a time, which is pretty good for a toy. I find myself playing with it when I'm supposed to be cleaning up the play room. Sure, it would be awesome if it had a volume control, but I don't think the volume is anywhere near damaging my child's hearing and I don't find the music annoying so I don't mind it. This is going to be my go-to gift for first birthdays!"

My son tried it out first and was very impressed.  The first thing I noticed was that the lights were easy to install.  Even I could do it.!!!  I wish all items were made that easy to use.  They are well made and fit  a variety of handle bars.  The lights are very bright and that's what you want for a bike.  They have three choices of slow flash, fast flash, and a constant light..  I was very impressed and  can give a 5 star rating.  The price is good also."
0,"I recently upgraded my brakes to Shimano Zee dual piston calipers to increase surface contact on gravity drops and needed to upgrade to a new  bracket (MA-F-180 S/P). This was used to fit an IS fork to a post mount caliper using a 180 rotor.  As usual Shimano continues to make perfect fitting high quality parts, it included the fixing bolts 2 X (M6x18.7mm) and a precision cut bracket.  To me the bolts seem a bit long, i'm used to a M6x15.2mm bolts.  Over great quality. Just make sure you know what bracket size and mount type before ordering."

The steps to gain self- esteem in the books are simple enough to follow and understand. Mostly we sacrifice those things to gain approval from others that result to low self-esteem in the long run. We should never take our self for granted. The book is well-written, concise and clear."

I am enjoying the strong main character.  She is she  of herself, smart, strong, and unapologetic.  Thought that does not mean she  is hateful and mean.  She is a good character that I would like to learn more about.  Secondary characters could use more background and development, though they are  not shallow caricatures, or too heavy handed stereotypes.  I will be getting the second book."

The DVD packaging, however, advertises 5 cardio routines - as if you can choose from 5 different workouts, which isn't the case. It's actually 5 combinations (3-4 minutes each) that are then combined at the end to complete the 25-minute cardio portion. Overall it's not too challenging but the instructors are very pleasant and motivating."

There are some very good parts.  The first part is about the woman who saves the man from the wolves and becomes the first wolf to ever kill a human.  The second part is about the two wolves who are a part of the story and the man who is one of the wolves.  I loved that part.  I read this book in two days.  I have read every one of the other books that I have read.  I enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read wolf stories.  It is a good story with lots of great characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.  I was expecting a bit of romance but that didn't happen.

0,"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing."

They are light and compact. The material is soft and comfortable. I will probably order a size larger and wear them a size larger. I just wish they were a bit longer. The material is very soft and very comfortable. I have had no complaints. I have a small, medium, and large waist. I'm 6'3"" and weigh 210 lbs. These are not as big as I thought they would be. They're a bit small for my waist, but they are not too big for me. I don't have to worry about the zipper going up."

It is a bit dimmer than the Schlage version, but I've had it for about a year now and I like the idea of having a ""taste"" of the bulb.

I'm going to order a half size larger in the Invicta Men's 1278 II and am happy with them.  I would not recommend these booties for anyone who does not have a size 10 or 11.

0,"We got this for our 2 and a half year old for Christmas, who loves trains. Yes, he loves the train but the coupling is very weak and loose and does not hold together well.  Also, for the price, there are very few train parts, and a lot of superfluous plain old dup.os.  Also, this item does not come with a track, although from the looks on the box, you might think so.  Another thing is that the figures that come with it are larger than other duplo sets, so they will not fit in other duplo vehicles, and the train roof will not close if they are inside. Not so much for the price. I would buy the circus train that duplo sells much cheaper."

0,"Great tubeless valves.  Had one valve core bend on me out in the woods, but I can't say that was the fault of the valves and not the mini pump.  I do wish they were keyed somehow to prevent rotation on the inside of the rim.  Other valves have ""V"" shaped grommets.  Not a big deal though."

1,"Extremely disappointed in our stay. This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online. I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be, only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for. The room smelled musty and not clean. Garbage was not changed from prior person. Found small ants in bathroom near shower. Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray. Overall this hotel is in a great location, but we would never visit again. Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online."

It was good to get a little more background and see some of the thoughts going on. The author does a great job of explaining the different types of love and how each person will make decisions based on what they feel is right for them. I like that the author does not have to go into detail about each person, but rather does a little more about them. I was very interested in this book and thought it was a very good read.I read this book in one sitting and I loved it.  I don't know if I would recommend it to others"

1,"This is a beautiful leather wallet. The design is very classy and elegant. The inside is just gorgeous. The top is a nice, solid pocket with a wallet inside. The material is nice and soft and it is very light weight. The size is perfect and the wallet is very comfortable. I would recommend this wallet to anyone.Very good quality. Well made. I've had this bag for a few years and I love the color and the design. I will buy another one.I got this for my son who is about to age out of his first year of school.  He is a big fan of the Casio leather shoes, but he loves the extra length.  The reason I got this is because I don't like the ""gleaming"" effect of the leather.  I wish the sole of the shoe was a bit longer, but overall I like the leather.  I wear a 9.5 and my 9.5 fits perfectly.  I bought a 9.5 in black and it's perfect.  I also like the extra width and it's very comfortable.  I wish the leather were a little thicker, but not too thin either.  The leather is very soft and comfortable.  The material is thin and holds up well.  I'm 5'2"" and these shoes are a little long for me.  They are still a little tight and there isn't a lot of support.  The toe box is a little loose around the calf area, but that's OK because they're very comfortable."
1,"Massimo Troisi's last work as a director, the movie is a cold war thriller, a war film. The film is set in a small town where a couple of lonely, wealthy women go to a bar and get drunk. The movie is set in an idyllic town with no bank, no TV, and no supermarket. There is a man who lives with his wife and children and has a small group of friends who go to the bar and buy drinks for him. He goes into the bar and buys a gun and runs away."

I did put it up and take down to check it out and it is well made, sturdy and will get a lot of use on our deck this summer as our yard is not fenced.  I must admit folding it up again was a chore and I still am not sure I got it right.

Yes it is somewhat thin, but I think it will do the job very well.  Will find out in less than 2 weeks and will report back.  On our last trip with our cat, she went #2 and what a mess!!

However, it is a very nice and secure harness.  The only downside is that it does not come with a harness.  I had to buy another one.  I just put it on and it was all over the place.  It is very easy to put on.  My dog is very small.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I highly recommend it."

She faces two big obstacles...Adam is a genius, but socially awkward and she can't tell him she has been hired to help him.  This book is Ms. Livesay's debut with Avon Impulse and I think they have found a promising author.  I definitely enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet story about accepting those we love for who they are and seeing the potential in them.  Chelsea and Adam were a cute couple.  I loved Adam and his inability to lie.  He is a genius with a form of Aspergers that makes him very literal. It was actually kind of refreshing and made him more vulnerable.  Chelsea grew up in poverty and sees her success as a way to prove she is better than her adolescent life. She has some lessons to learn about what is really important.  I would definitely recommend this one. It's a cute story and I look forward to more from this author,  I hope Mike, Jonathon and Indi get their own stories!  * I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."

0,A wonderful love story that endured the sinking of a Lusitania and a World War. I shed a few tears with this book and anything but a HEA would have been heart breaking for me.

0,"My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February. This little hotel was the perfect place for us. The lobby is very small but also cozy, and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was pretty spacious, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st, so there was really no view. The bathroom was a good size, including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. There was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us. Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location. We were only a few steps from State, Rush, and North Michigan. Tons of shopping, bars, and good food are easily within walking distance. This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. We highly recommend the Talbott, and will gladly stay again on return trips."

He's also determined to get her out of the group.  He has no idea where she is, but he's determined to find her.  I loved this book.  I thought the ending was a little rushed.  I loved that the author let the reader in on a little of the emotions of the characters and didn't try to put them down.  I was left wanting more.  I couldn't put it down.  I didn't want to put it down.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.  You will enjoy reading it.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.I really enjoyed this book.

I would recommend it for anyone who likes to read about relationships.I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I'm not sure if it was because of the author's love for the characters or the ending. I'm sure there will be more to come.  I read this book in the middle of a work day and was disappointed. I can't imagine how much time I spent on it. I was given the opportunity to read it to my husband and I was immediately hooked. It's a good story, but I really didn't like the book.

0,"...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".  I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.  The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'  At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.  {If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}  The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight."

I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more in the series. This is a good story. The characters are well developed. The story is well written and the story is very well told. The ending is satisfying and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. I loved this book. It was very sweet, very emotional, and had a really nice ending. I was just so happy that I got to read it. I was a little confused at first, but I did like it. I'm glad I got to read it. I'm looking forward to reading more of the series. I have to say I didn't expect anything to happen in this book. I really enjoyed the story and the characters. It was good to see some of the secondary characters getting their own books. I think it was a good story for a short read. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. A lovely story of a young woman who doesn't know where to start. She gets lost in a forest and finds herself in a small town that is haunted by ghosts and a well-known fairy tale."

Every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel, at our fingertips. And the location is perfect--right in downtown Chicago. We stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites. It was exquisite--so elegant and beautiful. It was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in. The service was impeccable. Every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed. We had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel. It was delicious! We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway."
0,"I've never been a big Swiss Army knife fan, primarily because of all the ridiculous ""tools"" that get included with so many of them (a corkscrew? Really? Like I'm opening a bottle of wine on my camping trip...) but also because of the bulk that these tools create. This one changed my mind, I love this thing. It's well made, feels great in hand, has USEFUL tools with no frills and all in a profile I can actually keep in my pocket without creating a ridiculous looking bulge. I also REALLY love that the blade and the large flat screwdriver have liner locks. I've owned other Victorinox models that I found myself staying away from because the lack of a lock created dangerous use conditions. And let's be honest, the fact that the German Military chose this as their standard issue says a lot."

0,"As my former bugout bag (45L, no frame S&W tactical pack, which I truly love) hath recently runneth over, I was in the market for a larger, molle compatible pack with an internal frame. When I was offered this pack at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, I jumped at it.  This is my third bag from Gonex, but the first one that doesn't fold up into its  own pocket. I was impressed with the heavy duty 900D nylon and the quality construction throughout. The shoulders, waist belt and back are nicely padded. The molle attachments on top, back and sides allow the bag to be configured in various ways by adding molle compatible pouches, and there are straps on top and bottom for carryig sleeping bags, tents etc.  My favorite features: - included, attached rain cover (this is in the semi hidden very bottom pocket, zipper next to the lumbar padding). I also like that the rain cover on the desert camo pack is a solid tan. When deployed, the pack looks more 'weekend getaway' and less 'SHTF' with the solid cover. - pockets in the waist belt. They aren't huge, but will fit small items like a wallet, phone or power bars. - the zipper runs the full length of the main compartment, giving easy access to everything - there are 5 pockets on the inside of the main compartment flap; 1 zippered, 2 velcro and 1 open mesh - 3 position height adjustment - water bottle/ snack pockets on the sides - molle attachments everywhere!  My minor quibble: - the lining and cover are a slightly different color (more yellow) than the tan in the camo. Not a huge deal, but I would have liked it to match.  Overall, this is an excellent pack that is worth the price."

0,"Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.  When I received the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vintage-Vacations-2000-Piece-Puzzle/dp/B006ROJPD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vintage Vacations 2000 Piece Puzzle</a>&nbsp;it brought back memories of these vacations and I was excited to start the puzzle.  First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5"" x 29.5"", so not a small puzzle by any means.  Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.  My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.  I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.  Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too."

0,"I bought this food processor a little over 3 years ago and have been very happy with it the whole time.  About a week ago, I had a problem where it wasn't assembled properly and turned on anyway: it should not have been able to do this, it damaged itself and posed a safety hazard in doing so.  I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.  A company can't entirely prevent malfunctions.  This is the best customer service experience I have had in years.  I recommend KitchenAid products on the strength of this experience alone."

0,"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.  ""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.  I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.  Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.  Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.  If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.  Recommended (the price is certainly right - I paid only $10.86 with tax for both movies!), but not for the squeamish."

Then the felt actually acquired a couple more knots from how quickly I was waving it over the next few days.

0,"As stated by the title...this product is NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE!  The zippered opening does not allow for someone much taller than about 5'11"" to get into it.  If you are short, you can get into the costume easily feet first.  If you are tall, you must go in head first, lay down and cross your legs and get someone to help you put your feet into the correct places.  I could BARELY bend my legs enough to fit them into the leg openings, even having wiggled my shoulders up into the head area as much as I could.  Now as long as you're under that height I mentioned, your weight doesn't matter a bit.  It's a very forgiving costume and would be very easy for a plus size person to wear.  I don't know what the limit would be, but we were able to get my ~300lb friend into it with no trouble.  The fan makes an annoying sound...so it's not like you could wear this to work and sit at your computer quietly.  But changes are...you're going to be running around like an idiot at a party in this thing so nobody will care about the fan whirr.  It does get hot inside and you will fog up the thing.  There's no way for this really to be avoided.  Costume feels super cheap when you take it out of the package and you'll need to find somewhere inside the suit to secure the fan.  I'm unable to wear this costume without having someone help me get in and out of it, due to my height, but if you're shorter you should be able to manage ok.  You can run, walk, bicycle, drive, sit, dance, all very easily.  It's very light and if you bump into something, it just deflates that part and fills right back up quickly.  Fun to run around in and scare children."

The room had a slight odor to it, kind of a fishy smell. The people at the front desk were rude to us. And I found a soiled pair of women's panties under the bed. Gross!

These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.  Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all? I would have to say if you have any problems with violence both physical and sexual this book could trigger your own dreams, but that being said I would recommend this book to others and I for one can not wait to read more about these brothers!!"

I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac.

1,"We planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago. Our fun time was not exactly that. Upon arriving for our weekend getaway, we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite, did not mean a thing. Apparently, there were none of the kids suites available. The kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room: coloring, video games, etc. No one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available. Whatever. So, we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available. Guess what? We spent the whole weekend in the same room. Yes, the staff apologized, but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it. Other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean. We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel, but I will not be booking a room here again. The staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all."

1,"We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room. The rooms had just been renovated, but the changes did not make much of a difference. The room was so small, it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat. The decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room. We were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room, but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us; there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers. We called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them. It would not have mattered if they sent a second set; the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers. As hotel guests, we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for. We were severely disappointed."

It's a very fun toy for all ages
1,"This hotel is ok but is not the best for the money. First of all the parking prices are exorbitant. I know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high. Also, the service at this hotel was poor. I felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general, and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us. In addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet. Also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you. I would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House."

0,"One cannot ask for a better product than this exercise pen.  Although I did not purchase this playpen for a puppy, it served its purpose exceptionally well for a mother cat and her five newborn kittens.  The purpose was to keep them isolated from my other cats while they were being cared for by momma and so that they could not wonder off and become lost prior to their eyes opening.  This playpen is built strong and durable, with two zippered opening on the side.  The netting on each opening can be rolled up and vecroed into place.  The entire top can be zippered off and on, providing easy access to reach your puppy or kittens/cats.  Two sturdy pouches on the side is available for grooming products and accessories.  There is also two net pockets.  One of the nicest attributes of this playpen is;  it can be folded and broken down quickly and stored in the storage pouch that comes with it.  Portable and easily moved by two people, even when erected.  Durable enough to be placed outside to allow your pets to get that fresh air environment.  I highly recommend this product if you're looking for something to assist in isolating your pets during their younger days.  For the price, you will not be disappointed."

0,"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.  Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!  This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.  The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.  I highly recommend this unit to anyone."

Stiff extension cords are the pits. The plug lights up when power is present. Thought of this feature as a gimmick prior to purchase, but it's quite useful. The highly visible yellow color makes the cord easy to find in storage and spot when it's underfoot. Jacket is soft to the touch, but appears durable. Arrived quickly and in good shape.

The front desk was not responsive to our needs at all, but we did finally get moved to a new room. The water pressure in the shower was hardly enough to get the shampoo out of our hair and the beds were lumpy. I was very disappointed in the workout room, it was very small so I decided to swim laps instead, but when I got to the pool it didn't look like it had been maintained all week. Needless to say we won't make the mistake of staying with Homewood Suites again."

I can easily toss this baby into my purse and take it any where I go with such ease!  Super easy to connect it to my iPhone with just a touch of a button and a quick tone to let me know it's ready!  Speak arrived with 50% of a charge which thrilled me because I couldn't wait to use it.  There's a LED light that is red when charging (which only took over 1 1/2 hours to get a full charge once I drained it completely) and a blue light when it's on. Cute little handle that unhooks so you can attach it to anything / anywhere (purse handle, cooler handle, etc)."

1,"I installed this switch in a standard garage door opener. I chose this one because I was just starting to get into the garage. The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.  I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic.

0,"I bought this vacuum primarily for use on my laminate floors, and it works very well. I'm very pleased with the suction, especially given the price. The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac. Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product."

0,"This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue, a five minute walk from the Orange 'Loop' line that will get you to and from Midway Airport. Forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. Our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). Decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. On the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side, however, there were Aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby. The front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. I read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. I got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when I needed it, change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning. The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower, the Drury Theater, John Hancock, and magnificent mile. For those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [--]. This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning, no less: $1.99. The hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. We would stay at the Hard Rock again, and think it is great for people with 'tweens.' Not sure about the toddler set, though."

1,"We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel. We found it conveniently located on E. Superior Street, near many local attractions. The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. The pillow menu was awesome, my partner and I have such different preferences, the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! I couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. My Beagle, Betsy enjoyed her stay at the 'Jet Set Pet' care center. She was pampered as much as I was. It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit. It included an iPod Shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist, a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours, and comfort items like a towel and map! I felt like I was the most important guest (surely, everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel!!"
0,"The battle with Juromaru and Kageromaru where Koga and Inuyasha team up aside this disk obviously shows they were cleaning the studio that week.  How else could you explain getting a pair of episodes that was mainly soap suds.  Now I think the series needed this slow down to allow our heroes time to reflect on relationships, but will someone please smack Inuyasha!  Inuyasha basically said it himself that all his feelings for Kikyo are revolving around guilt and obligation because Kikyo died for him.  He feels it's necessary to give his life for her at the very least.  Please, the girl pulled a knife on him while they were embracing and even said he was like Naraku in his feelings toward her.  How many more evil things does this dead priestess have to do before he gets a clue that the Kikyo he fell in love with is no longer going by that name?"

It also comes with a hard plastic blade guard that protects the blade when it's tossed in a drawer.

0,"I have to put the disclaimer out there that we are not done training!! This is why I've only given 4 stars. I had to pause in the training as we went away (kitty went with) and didn't want to thoroughly confuse the poor guy!  I have a young Maine Coon. He's approx. 17lbs. The CitiKitty has no trouble holding his weight. I considered toilet training after meeting a woman who has four cats and 1 bathroom. She and her husband trained their four cats to all use the toilet. It made me chuckle when she told us about it, but it stayed in the back of my mind.  I got tired of stepping in litter - the Big Naughty is a slob! - and remembered the toilet training scenario mentioned above and decided to look into it.  Week 1: The first week this worked really well. The Big Naughty didn't have any accidents.  Week 2: After removing the inner ring, Naughty wasn't as big a fan of going on the toilet. He had a few accidents, and once he started going on the toilet again he decided he didn't like (or couldn't figure out) to go poo in the toilet; so he would go on the floor beside the toilet. As suggested we kept the ring at the week 2 mark for an extra week, but then I went away for the holidays and took him with me so I decided to put the training on hold until after we returned so as not to confuse him.  I've yet to commence training again, I have quite a busy schedule. I am looking forward to starting again and completing the training. I dream of the day I do not step in the scattered litter on the bathroom floor, no longer having to sweep litter up daily, no longer buying litter, no more scooping litter, etc.  I will update more thoroughly once we make the concerted effort to train again."

0,"I bought the ""pro pack"" It just comes with all of the filter media (Ceramic Rings, Carbon, and Bio Rings) And extra white and blue filter pads. This filter is easy to set up as long as you do everything right, It took me a while at first until I realized that the motor head wasn't put in right(Made a loud gurgling noise). but after that it worked perfect, the only noise you hear is a little hum. I've had it for about 2 weeks. and it has been keeping the the water crystal clear! which amazed me because turtles dirty water so much so fast. So I'm pretty amazed, I'd say the water clarity has never dropped below 90%. and I love it, This is a fantastic canister filter for the price, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good cheap canister, I really have nothing bad to say besides every once in a while I have to pump air out of it (I have aerators and live plants so my oxygen levels are really high) And it pulls the little microscopic bubbles through and they build up into bigger air bubbles. And one of my plants got sucked into the filter and clogged it (outtake was low flow), and the extra filter pads that came with were TOO BIG for the filter (I cut them to size). But as of right now everything works fantastic and I have no complaints otherwise. Just care for it properly, set it up right, and good luck!!"

The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback. It was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response 'Quiet'. My visit was anything but, mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor, facing the street. I awoke at 4 a.m. and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window. Not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting. At check-out when I informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said, ' Ah, city noise.'"

The action is taut and thrilling and the interactions of the characters just grows on you, the acting is so real you almost think it's really happening.

1,"I first heard of David H. Lawrence when I was a child.  He was a one-time college grader and I learned a lot about the intellectual landscape in the late 1950's.  I still remember reading his work, especially his ""The Key to the Universe.""  I think it's a good read, especially if you are a child.  I've heard of David H. Lawrence, but I think I am more likely to be interested in his other works.  I highly recommend this book.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a book club.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the history of the Civil War.I've read all of the books in this"

It was very predictable and I felt like I was in the middle of the story. I have not read the other books in the series. I think this is a good ending. The main character is a great character and I hope the next book will be the same.I love the characters and this was a great read! The ending was a bit abrupt but it was nice to have a little mystery thrown in.  The author made me cry a few times and I am a little happy that it ended.I just finished this book and it was very good.

I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station. I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago's premiere shopping areas. The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations, while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service. The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world. Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious. In short, Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation, meeting all my needs and more!"

0,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

0,"I have spent some amount of time playing with this walnut sized wonder. It is unexplainably addictive. Maybe it's the rather cool free apps that Ozobot has available for it. Maybe it's the color changing LED lights. Maybe it's the way you calibrate and tune it. The cool factor is just off the charts. I like the Ozobot Dance app the best. You place it on a space and with light flashes it programs this little beast. Then you press play and it signals the robo critter to do it's thing. It will go on top of your tablet or phone spinning, flashing and scooting along.  It must have taken quite some engineering to come up with this. To distill it for you it's sensors can detect lines and colors. It will change what it's doing, program itself and perform all of it's functions that way. Everything you need comes in the box. A couple of things to share with you: Instructions say you need to calibrate and tune it every time before you use it. But you can use it a few times without doing that, it seems if you only wait a few moments before uses it seems to hang on to it's setup. But if it's shut off for more than a few minutes you definitely need to go through the calibration/motors tune process (very easy).  It's not entirely perfect all the time during the tune process. Sometimes it seems to forget what it's doing, you just put it back in it's start position and usually it will be fine. Occasionally you will turn it off then repeat the tuning process. It's not a hassle. The whole experience is fun. Registration is free and gives you access to a lot of extras at no charge. I love this little nugget of technology. I've attached a picture with a sugar packet in comparison to give you an idea of it's true size. Sample for fair review."
0,"I am disappointed with the ending, regardless if I like the writers style if I want to see a world where the bad guy wins all I have to do is watch todays news. and to really top it off to quote one of the most depressing writers of the 20th century to justify said ending.  I won't read this author again."

I own 10 heli's; 3-Drift Kings, excellent, 2- Syma 107s, excellent, 1- 109G, 1- 111G, all excellent, 1- Xieda radio x-trol, flyable, but only just, 1- JXD 338 Sky Wolf mid-size radio x-trol, clumsy but, it's pretty cool and it flies well. Now I own this JXD 339, which I had been eyeing for some time thinking, wouldn't it be cool if this one acted like a 3ch Drift King! But, in the product description, it doesn't say anything about it being a two speed, like the DK. I happened to read a review where some one mentioned that it was, and when I saw that, I ordered it. It is a nice looking heli! Mine came in gold, which is what I was hoping for. When I started flying it, I found that the rotation rate is very fast, but low speed is painfully slow, and high speed would not keep up with a stock 107. Every heli I've flown has it's own characteristics. Some are quick, others sluggish, some fast, others are touchy. This one is just plain weird! A curved left, in high speed makes it almost stop and spiral up. A right curve, if done just a little to fast, causes it to do a motorcycle-type high-side, causing the upper and lower blades to collide, causing an instant crash! As much as I want to like this one, I don't know how I'm going to make myself do that! Very Disappointed!"

0,"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.  1 month follow-up:   This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's."

The box was filled with a lot of metal and it was hard to get the tools out. I had to use some of the tools with the edge of the tool to get it out. The box was very heavy so I had to get some extra tools to get it out of the box. I ended up using a bit of a small bit of wood to get the tools out.

0,"This book dealt with the serious issue of racial inequality in our country. Hayes touched on many serious instances of this inequality, and provided historical antecedents for their existence. But, he jumped from issue to issue, without a smooth transition between topics. Just when I thought I knew what the focus of the book was, he inserted another issue into the mix. While these issues were seemingly related, I thought the inclusion of so many topics and reflections made for a choppy flow."

I appreciated the insert showing the various features, but wondered why a power adapter (DC5V,500mA, whatever THAT is!) wasn't included to charge the unit.  Manufactures would be well-advised to remember that Baby Boomers still want to get out camping, or maybe even just upgrade our emergency gear.

The speaker is surprisingly loud (louder than Garmin Nuvi 660, Magellan 3410 among others). The window mount is built very cheaply but you don't need a lot of strength as the ONE is very light.

This was so similarly written, right down to the same phrasing that it was a huge let down.  The main plot problem was different it was a lame problem.  This was a disappointing story.  I have never seen so much difficulty made out of one kiss.  The Hero could have confided the 'secret' but do to loyalty, he doesn't.  He loyalty was not admirable, it was annoying.  Everything that I loved in the first book, the common sense, the humor, the sensitivity to a difficult subject is either over-worked or just mundane, the second time around.  I am not sure if I am going to try the next one in the series.

First off, my husband and I couldn't find the place. It was our first time in Chicago after all. And when I would call for directions, they just kept putting me on hold. When my husband and I finally arrived, the bus boy was extremely rude. After man-handling our luggage, he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. Talk about arrogant. The front desk clerk was a little too pushy. My husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister's wedding, but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. The room itself was okay, decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you're worth. They even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the 'snack bar' and ordered a movie that I've never even heard of! Completely unprofessional. I will never, I repeat, NEVER stay at this hotel ever again."
1,"These re-branded German pliers feel better than the originals. I will admit that I have been using the cheaper ones for the past few months. The basic design of the re-branded pliers is a little awkward to use, but they work well. The two-finger tips are great for fastening a screw to the back of the tool and it is a little tricky to use for just about anything else. I am not sure if they are a good design for the tool, but I would be fine with it. I will definitely buy again. I have a few other re-branded German pliers and they work great. I have to say that I like the color and the feel of the re-branded ones, but they are not as sharp as the originals. I would have to give these a 5 star if I could. I have a few other German pliers that I will probably never use again, but these are a great choice. I love this light. I have been using it for several months now and it is always bright.

0,"Excellent Product for mounting your cell phone to the wall, plenty of room even if your cell phone is in its case. Can be used for all cell phones. Just make sure you read the directions FIRST. But beware unless you have smooth walls it will not adhere, I have rough stucco walls in most of my house and paneling in another part and it will not stick properly. To over come this problem I used Blank Outlet covers made of plastic and than screwed the covers to the wall and installed this product to the blank covers, this method works good for iPhone 4 & 5 and similar sized phones. I know most homes are just sheet-rocked walls and it will work fine."
1,"I usually don't write reviews, but I thought the review was a little misleading. I was just a little surprised at the quality. The material is soft, and the inside is very comfortable. I have had no issues with the fit, and it's not very see through. The shoe is a bit too tight for me to wear, but I'll try it on a few times. I'm just hoping that the heel portion of the shoe will loosen up after a few wearings. Overall, I'd say it's a good shoe, but I'm not sure how long it'll last. I've had a few pairs of shoes that have been too tight, and these are the only ones I've found that have lasted me at least a full season. I've had a few pairs of this brand, and I think I've found some that do. I'm still waiting on a return, but I'm sure I'll find a better shoe, and I'm going to try them on next time I'm wearing them. UPDATE: I've been wearing these shoes for a couple weeks now, and they seem to be working well."

0,"Stay Away! After generations as an old-world, cozy and stately, if a bit tired oasis, the AE has been purchased by Ian Schrager and taken down so many notches it's almost not functional. Allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation, the entrance is not handicapped accessible, and I saw several hotel guests with canes, casts, etc (including myself, recovering from foot surgery and in a cast, with a cane) struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel. With luggage, it's almost impossible. This is simply inexcusable. I've been a customer of the Ambassador East for decades--but no more. The hallways are so dark one can barely see. The rooms are stark white, which in and of itself, isn't a particular problem, but it is jarring and almost painful as one's eyes adjust from the dark hallways. The furniture--stark and scant--looks like something from an Ikea closeout. The bed is comfortable--what a relief--but only about 15 inches off of the floor, a real problem if you're at all physically challenged, or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days. The problems don't end there. My room had a horribly uncomfortable wire/metal desk chair, and absolutely nowhere else to sit. No arm chair, no demi-sofa, no ottoman. With a foot in a cast, it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably, perhaps even with my leg elevated, while in the room. No way. The bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries. Not a shelf, a small table, a nook, or a medicine cabinet. If you want to put a razor, shaving cream, makeup (for women) or anything else down so that you can use them, you're sh*t out of luck. Repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet. A borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable, something I didn't discover until caught in an expected downpour. I was tempted to throw it out, but remembered that they would charge me for it if I didn't return it, in spite of its total lack of usefulness. Refrigerator--forget it. Shampoo? For two days in a row, the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion, and no shampoo. Room service--not available. If you want breakfast, the front desk will sell you a small, pre-wrapped, commercial grade muffin for $4.00--something you can buy in any gas station for $1.00. No added value whatsoever. The photos show a nice entrance, and a large lobby for which the AE has long been famous. Unfortunately, that lobby is closed off, under construction, and the temporary lobby is on the second floor, difficult, again, for handicapped access. Thermos-bottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold, at 8 in the morning. When confronted with these various misses, the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said, 'Yeah, we know, you're not the first to tell us this stuff.' All this shows is that Schrager doesn't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable, and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right. It's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it's under renovation. It's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain, particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. Again, avoid this hotel like the plague."

0,"I've really enjoyed this series and feel this book is the best so far. Relationship issues between the main characters (Ivy, Rachel, Jenks, etc. ) are becoming more complex and less confusing. The author has really hit her stride in bringing all of these characters to life. The plot was fast-paced, resulting in me staying up way too late to finish it. Although the main character, Rachel, is getting stronger, she still has flaws and makes mistakes - keeping her real. The only (mild) criticism that comes to mind is the continued Ivy/Rachel angst. It hasn't hit overload yet, but I fear it might if it continues throughout the series. Overall, this was a great 5-star read for me."

0,"I bought this book with great expectation having read the glowing reviews here at amazon.  The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned. On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past. Stegner writes a convincing enough narrative about the grace of surviving life, but as for me, the next time I want a story about nothing, I will tune in to a Seinfeld rerun."

DISADVANTAGE #2: On certain doorknobs, the rubber-like pads inside the cover might grip the knob too tightly, so that a child will be able to open the door with only moderate effort.

0,"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more. I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase."

0,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.  Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.  Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.  Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!  Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games."
0,I did receive these as a promotion and I really like these gloves. They protect my hands from heat with a pot I took right off the stove and tried them by holding it in my hand. Didn't feel any heat transfer. The silicon grips are great too as I don't feel that my hands are going to slip. Have used them multiple times and they do not transfer heat. I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus. I would probably like the longer cuff for taking pans out of an oven but it is not like these are short and I don't think I will burn myself but maybe if you are a bit clumsy you might? I would totally recommend them even if I was buying them.

0,"Ill admit some of the changes in the special edition weren't great namely greedo firing first and the new songs in return of the jedi.  but this dvd only serves to make the films look a little better and have better continuity.  Greedo fires first looks a lot better and the timing is more like they fire at the same time.  Jabba and the speeder looks way bettter in a new hope this time.  the emperor and boba fett are played by who they should be played by in empire strikes back.  and anakin appears as he appeared before he ceased to exist.  how could anakin have grown older.  as obi wan says anakin ceased to exist when he became vader.  ill admit it would be nice to have the originals as a bonus feature like on the alien quadrilogy discs, or at least have a comparison feature so you can see the original scenes that were changed like on Star Trek the motion picture, but the fact is the dvd makes all good changes, so stop whining about it."

To have the courage to pursue passion! The author created a great plot that never lacked for twists and turns. I love a smart, well dressed, sexually confident man, nothing compares with the Alpha male created in this book."
0,We have a mini schnauzer and this works well on him. He barks and raises hell with everyone & thing in the alley. We have a privacy fence but he still challenges every body and ignores spoken commands. With the Pet Agree I can be on my deck some 40 plus feet away from the dog barking thru the fence and and give the unit just a quick tap and instantly redirect the dog's attention and stop his barking. I find he is barking at things real or imagined much less than before we got the Pet Agree. And if needed a quick tap always does the trick.

0,"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.  But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.  Best regards."
1,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.  The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them."

0,"I love this book, I just do. From the original character names to the wholly original plot to that cover that screams, ""READ ME!"" It's hard not to fall in love with Laini Taylor's debut novel and I can see why this book has garnered so much attention. It is flawless written with lush words that fill the pages, enticing the reader deeper and deeper into the book.  Karou--I seriously just love that name--is a phenomenal lead. Seeing the world through her eyes was beautiful and exhilarating. She is the tip of the amazing-character-iceberg. I love her and Akiva. They are literary gold, and I cannot get enough of them. Just please, give me more. NOW.  There is something that is pure magic about certain books, and Daughter of Smoke and Bone has it. There are few books on my shelves I will reread because I am in awe of the way a writer places the words together to make a sentence full of enchantment. I can safely say this book has earned that distinction. Many books are good, have fun plots or witty characters, but it's the places in between the action, in between the dialogue, that draw me in. It's the space between the heartbeats of a novel that win me over and fuse with my heart.  For a book so large, the ending came entirely too fast. I was left desperate for more at the end, and with too many questions that really need answering. I suppose that is the mark of a great book--leave them panting for more, right? If that is the ultimate goal, Taylor has it in spades. I truly hope one day I get to meet Laini Taylor; her mind must be an amazing place to create such a wild, vivid story that has captured so many readers. I can only imagine she would be as charming and creative in person."

It is great for anyone looking for a multi-tool. This is a great tool for the money. It is very easy to use and holds the item very well. I wish I could have bought a different item with the same price. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary.

0,"We've had to switch brands multiple times when buying bully sticks.  The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in.  These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best ones ahead of time.  That was nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones.  But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer.  Some brands started out this way but then started selling packages were the sticks were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much.  I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it comes from, but the dark ones seem to be the best.  I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or less in pretty short order, maybe 30 minutes or so, then finishes the entire thing later.  When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces.  He's a big dog at almost 70 pounds though, and only water buffalo horns and bones last any length of time.  I've seen many reviews on many bully sticks wanting 'odorless' sticks.  I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it does smell a little bit.  I don't even notice it unless I'm sitting by my dog, though."

The rotating plug design, and compact size, make for a nice unit for travel.

0,"One of those films you wish you'd written yourself.  I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.  Why? Because it's credible. A few years from now, something like this WILL be happening, as AI influences people, AI becomes as real as real people, and it has the chance to become all powerful.  Forget movies like Transcendence. This is the way it'll happen, pretty much."

0,"Reading through the different reviews here, you'd think this guy were Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and Wolfgang Mozart rolled into one.  Let me think of the simplest way to say this:  he's not. The storyline was original, that's for sure.  And his emotion is raw.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of something - although what exactly that is (misdirected youth?  the refusal to accept that people usually _earn_ money?) is sometimes muddled. But the delivery is poor.  I found it cutesy and contrived.  He relies on the same old gag structure again and again - that one line delivered at the very end to set the last three pages' worth of diatribe on its ear:  ""You just missed your exit"".  ""The wallet was there the whole time.""  and so on.  Add that to the fact that the timeline was impossible to follow, and that the technique of alternating paragraphs between two different time periods does not a gifted writer make, and this presentation had serious flaws. Unrestrained by literary devices such as plot, he goes on to present a convoluted ""three years [I think it was three years although time flow was truly warped] in the life of"" stream-or-consciousness (whoops I meant ""stream OF consciousness"") story of his recent life. What's he getting at?  Is he misdirected?  Uninspired?  Lazy?  All of the above?  Am I supposed to admire this?  Is this the role-model of the 21st century?  For the story to be potent, I think it needed a sharper edge."

0,"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.  Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.  While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her."

0,"The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. Unfortunately, the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. The front desk staff was rude, the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. There are three elevators but good luck with them all working. They are very very small and when only one is up and running...you end up waiting a long time for one. Not fun when you are on the 12th floor. The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at all...the room felt damp and miserable. We put the thermostat as low as it would let us (65) and the room never went below 78. (and it was 107 outside the whole trip!!!). There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. Internet is not free either... Overall, I would never stay here again."

Garwood managed masterfully to describe her main characters and convey excellently the medieval atmosphere.  However, nothing like this was achieved in ""Heartbreaker"". My feelings concerning this book are very mixed. There were good moments and I sometimes even smiled at the one or the other verbal attack. But the story never really ""took off"".

They were an unlikely couple but made it work. Tina had fled her abusive ex and landed in the arms of a sexy biker. Irish was everything her ex wasn't. Oh my gosh, the man is so loveable and sexy!!  He quickly is in her life and tries to get her to lower that wall that she's built up around her heart. Can she lower that wall or will she keep her heart guarded?  Because this is a novella, I feel like there's a lot more to Irish and Tina's story and it's a shame this story ended just as I was getting into it!  Overall, a great book!  Review on behalf of Once Upon An Alpha."

0,"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comfortable travel pillows Ive ever used.  WHAT IT IS:  - A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck for support with the optional benefit of heat.  WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:  - Memory foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The memory-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comfort and support. Extremely comfortable/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds more support.  - There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit for those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.  I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when working at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The memory foam and plush cover make this pillow comfortable to use for longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need for heat.  Heat or no heat, the THERMATECK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is wonderful."

This coffee maker is a great value. I have a Norpro coffee maker that uses a larger size coffee maker, so I would highly recommend this one. I have a Norpro Cuisinart Cuisinart Coffee Maker, but I can't find another coffee maker that I can buy this at a reasonable price. It is a great coffee maker and I would highly recommend it.

When Alianne, or Aly, daughter of Alanna the Lioness leaves home, she misfigures a vital piece to her plan - pirates. Pirates capture her, shave her bald, and sell her as a slave. To prevent being sold as a 'bed-warmer' (someone for the master to sleep with), she dives into danger to become damaged. She is finally thrown into a deal free, and becomes part of a kind family - one that is in the misfavor of the king. She becomes chosen by a trickster god to protect the children of the family. The climax rises, especially when a crow turned human just learning about romance decides he wants Aly for his mate."

I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for The Alpha King, but I know I've worked my way through a few versions of the Kindle since I first read The First Alpha!  I fell deeply in love with this series way back in 2013, and since then I've checked back every week for news on the sequel. Now it's here I know it was worth the wait! I fell in love with Thomas Smith from the first page, but when I realised who he was - and how he works into the world of the Five Tribes - I fell in love all over again. I don't want to give away the twist, but if you've read The First Alpha you'll be blown away when you... well, you'll know it when you see it :)  As for the romantic element, LOVE IT! I love a ballsy, take no prisoners heroine, and I love how Evelyn deals with the men she encounters in this male-dominated world of 1912. She's more than a match for 'Thomas' (or should I call him... no, no spoilers), and I can't wait to see how they deal with the Ironclaws now they're a team.  Please don't make us wait so long for the next book, K A.

On the way he meets Aislinn who is going going for the what if because until now nothing else has worked. Oh and she does not want to have anything else to do with doctors so Hugo best be wary. Added to the lovely mix is also Punda who is drawn to them so this author takes you with them to weave her special blend of magic to give you their story here. What will soon be discovered though for Aislinn will be hard to break but with the love she can receive from these two anything is possible. Hugo will also learn that there is more to life then mere science and that the best is yet to come. Righteous title that is fitting to say the least with the reader can find out why. Punda will also get more than she asked for or thought she would need but after you get to know her what she will get is perfect. Great battle with the winners taking the prize.

Years ago I was a regular reader of Dave Barry's syndicated column and gradually wearied of its seeming predictability. The novel format seems to have liberated his inner zaniness to good effect. The featured character, a dog, never fails to draw the kind of out-loud guffaws that make people look at you strangely if you're reading in a public place.

0,"I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.  This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full.

Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.  Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way.

0,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:  1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents. 2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend. 3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container. 4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking. 5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor. 6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems. 7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes. 8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.  I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot."

0,These lights add a nice warm accent to my bedroom.  I wrapped them around the canopy posts of my bed and it looks very inviting and calming.  They are bright enough but not so bright that it is hard to look at.  They don't seem to heat up too hot although I don't check that very often since they are up so high.  They just add a lovely feature to my room that lights it with a warm tone that seems to make everything else in my room look nicer than it really is so I always have them on if guests come over!

She wants V.I. to help her coach 4 hours a week. V.I. takes on the job and is drawn into the lives of her players.  Josie Dorrado's mother Rose begs her for help as the factory where she works has been sabotaged. Frank Zamar, the factory owner, is angry with V.I., and refuses her help as he is obviously terrified of something.  V.I.'s private life is also in turmoil. The man in her life, Morrell, an investigative reporter, is at home recovering from a serious gunshot wound; and Marcena Love, an attractive and gutsy colleague, is staying with him. Marcena is trying to come up with a story on South Chicago and uses V.I.'s work with the basketball team as a way to get to know people. She ends up getting very close to the player's fathers.  The team needs a real coach, a new gym floor and equipment, so V.I. begins to search for corporate sponsors. She meets the grandson of the famous Bill Bysen, the head of a large conservative huge department store chain called By-Smart. Unlike his family, Billy is an idealist that can see how his family's business practices are harming the neighborhood. Billy brings the pastor of the South Chicago church where he is working to preach at the company headquarter's morning prayer meeting. This really antagonizes the family when the preacher lectures them on their responsibility to the poor and the community.  Armchair Interviews says: Paretsky has another hit here.

We have long-haired cats and Siberian Huskies, so any little tiny pieces of lint or animal fur that was anywhere in a 60 yard radius ended up on her cottom leos.

He still sheds after about 5 weeks.  He's a German Shepherd and I had to take him to a vet for his dry skin.  This product has helped him shed and shed less.  It's very easy to put on and take off and works well.  I use it on my dog who is just 6 months old and it's a little more snug than some other products I've used.  I think it's worth it.  I'm using it for my daughter's puppy.  I've had no problems with her shedding.  It's very absorbent.  My daughter will wear it for a few days before wearing it again.This is my second litter box.  My other one is a bit of a mess and the other one is just too big for my cat's litter box.  I have to replace the old one each time.  The new one is a bit more sturdy and less expensive.  The litter box was a breeze to install, but it took a bit of work for the cats to figure it out.  It is well made and it works well.  The cats are very happy and there is a good litter box.

0,"Brilliant white with a small, subtle logo on the left chest instead of that old big logo some brands use. The seams and edging all around this shirt are well sewn and smooth, no seconds here. The v-neck style is actually cut too low for my husband's taste, he said it looks like some of my v-neck t-shirts - as in too feminine for him.  The shirt does run small though and despite not liking the v-neck, he would wear it anyway if it fit right. It's a little narrow in the shoulders for him and fits more like a small. Compared to the medium t-shirts in other brands, this one is cut differently. On the plus side, it fits me fine and the fabric is very soft, but he's right, that v is feminine."

0,"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?  One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.  This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!  The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining."

My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel - no upgrades, no discounts. Apparently it is my problem that their manager can't manage the convention schedule. I don't even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I don't find their reservation system reliable. Unfortunately, due to the conference, there isn't any other place to stay."

0,"As a reader who is not an aficionado of speculative fiction or alternative historical fiction, this novel left me rather perplexed. Having read Robert Harris Fatherland a number of years ago (and having enjoyed it) and spurred by the popularity of the Amazon TV series inspired by Dicks novel, I dove in.  Set in an alternate post-WWII America that has been divided by the victorious Japanese and Nazis, the narrative focuses on five or six characters whose stories never quite coalesce; the fragmented narrative structure in itself is not necessarily a flaw (plenty of good novels feature fragmented narratives), but in Dicks novel, it definitely creates a lack of coherence that ultimately enervates the novel. More than half the book is devoted to exposition, but the payoffwhich doesnt really emerge until the final three chapters or so, once again in very fragmented fashionfeels uncertain and anticlimactic. Complicating matters is a novel within the novel, an alternate history that presumes the Allies had won the war but is itself different from the actual historical record (e.g., FDR did not serve four terms as President). Excerpts from this novel, called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, along with the I Ching, which every character seems to consult for guidance, appear throughout the story, yet again these elements fail to add any sort of coherence to the narrative.  Perhaps my lack of expertise in this genre handicaps my appreciation of this novel (which did, after all, win the Hugo Award), but I was, in the end, disappointed."

We love that is has so many ways for him to learn and he doesn't even know because he is having so much fun. There is color recognition, size recognition, stacking them on top of each other, nesting them inside each other, and attaching them just like a regular train.  The quality is very good and should last a long time even with heavy play.  Whether your child like Thomas the Train or not he will probably love this set and with its educational value I think this is a no brainer toy. Just get it neither of you will be disappointed.  If my review was helpful to you please click yes below, I would appreciate it."
0,"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that takes place in 1871-1872.  She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.  It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'.  He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots.  In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.   Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn.  He suggested that she find a more symbolic title.  When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion.  When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.  Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out.  Perkins prodded her to get going again.  This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.  Read THE YEARLING & also the excellent biography of Perkins by A. Scott Berg."
0,"First, this toy is far too large, even at the shortest placement of the seat. My kid is TALL for her age and she can barely reach the pedals. Second, the turning radius is awful. We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue. You need a grocery store parking lot to turn it around. They're now ""safe"" but no longer ""fun"". I will be looking for another version that actually turns."

I did have some issues with the opening on the back of the legs, but I will keep it that way. The metal is very sturdy, and I am very pleased with this product. It is very heavy, and does not move around. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a long wooden leg. I love the concept. It makes a great cup of coffee for my family.

The gimmick is very visible and identifiable.  Also, if you have big hands like I do, let's just say this trick is not for you.  It's made for people with small hands.  So I would have to say I was disappointed with the product.  It would be nice if these drawbacks were clearly stated in the product description."

The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore. REALLY? I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY? Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production. Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it was a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job."

0,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.  The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.  Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."
0,"I just set this up today, so I don't have a long-term review for this but here's what I like about it so far. It's very attractive (shocking for a pet fountain), because it's ceramic rather than plastic. So much better looking than the plastic ones I've had before. It looks like a decor piece instead of pet fountain, which makes me feel less like a crazy cat lady. And Emily, my cat, has already approved it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope it will last a long time."

I compared it to my other Q5 flashlights..and noticed the led size was smaller in my others..obviously they are putting whatever led they want in these so your taking a chance. But this one..was amazing..it was just as bright as my large T6 led flashlight..at about half the size. Guess I just got lucky..but there is a difference in all of them..so just remember..your rolling the dice when you order one.

0,"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll."

And the possibility of this transformation is a redeeming  element for Alex--and for human nature in general. Russian is my native  language, so the book flowed fairly easily for me after just a few pages.

I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.

If anything, the section on how the collapse of WTC1 and WTC2 was made more clear with the explanations supplied with the excerpted footage from Explosive Evidence than Explosive Evidence itself.  Where this documentary fell down was in the omission of Silverstein's PBS interview where he freely admitted that WTC7 was deliberately imploded, which was one of the few actual pieces of evidence given in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Myth-and-The-Reality-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000VRF4C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11: The Myth and The Reality - 2 DVD Set</a>.  The other glaring issue was the allegation that pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma were running rampant in the wake of the destruction of WTC1 and WTC2.  Problem:  asbestos-induced interstitial fibrosis and mesothelioma have very clear latency times of 20 years after the date of first exposure.  If such an epidemic is to happen, it will not happen for another 45 months from the time this review is written.  Also, mesothelioma already occurs in 1/1,000,000 people each year WITHOUT prior asbestos exposure.  If these diagnoses in past cases are correct, there are some equally disturbing causes: either a) there was prior exposure well ahead of 9/11, or b) there are additional toxic materials not previously identified to the public used in the construction of WTC1 and WTC2."

There are 7 different colors of Play-Doh in the big containers which basically pays for the set itself considering the price on individual Play-Doh at the local toy store! Well worth it!

The sides have a low profile that  make it easy to access items even if on a shelf. I have found its a great nail polish caddy, and for makeup items and since it fits perfectly in my bathroom drawer I will be purchasing another one or two.  Due to the size of the three compartments, its not the best for skinny items that tend to tip over, like gloss, mascara or brushes.

1,"We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago. We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained, luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill. First of all, the hotel is all suites. We stayed in one of the 'Premium Suites'. The accommodations were definitely luxurious, with premium bedding, very nice robes for our use, and a choice of pillows. We used the hypo-allergenic ones, but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma, we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. There were actually two TVs in our suite. There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access, a wet bar, an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile, with so much to do practically at the Omni's doorstep. I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage, which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni. It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended. I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly, recommending several excellent area restaurants. However, we think our best meal was at the Omni's 676 Restaurant, where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass. They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. Lastly, the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago, which was a highlight of our trip. We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future, where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience!"

0,"The Spindlers has all the right ingredients. The hero forced to descend into another world to accomplish a difficult quest. So many touches are just right; the rat as Betraying Woman, the nocturni as Supernatural Advisors, etc., etc. The nocturni are especially nice, but many of her other features, for me, kind of creak. They're a bit familiar. Need to pass through three chambers to rescue someone? Gee, who's had to do that recently? Since L. Frank Baum and Dorothy rescued the Royal Family a zillion years ago in the Road to Oz. Oh, it was Harry & Co, wasn't it?  Of course, none of that matters, because the formula, the Monomyth, is just that, a formula. It's supposed to be a formula. We don't want it messed with and changed.  But we do want it to be fresh. And The Spindlers just doesn't feel very fresh. Or authentic. Our hero was just...too nice. Her relationship with her brother was just not quite plausible to me, nor did she seem to be...interesting enough to warrant being a hero. No, this book is not Coraline. It lacks the sharp, harsh humor which lends reality to newly created worlds. Too bad, because some of her inventions were vivid. The rat with no friends, the nocturni.

0,"I have to dress the blade (with aluminum oxide dressing stick) after every few dozen cuts to maintain a minimum amount of blowout in the back of the translucent glass tiles But I think that is pretty standard. Using this in conjunction with a Dewalt wet saw has consistently produced very smooth and accurate cuts. Most cuts are so smooth I do not need to use a sanding stone to smooth the edges of the tiles. Additionally, the blade has allowed me to accurately make U-shaped cut-outs for electrical boxes and NOT have to use tile nippers. The side of the blade is good for grinding sideways along a line so the cut-outs are smooth."

1,"This review could get better, but I thought it would be better to make a small review about the other two.  The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.  I will update this review if I see anything else that is different.  I would recommend this set of rings.I really like these. They are very soft and soft.

0,"Sometimes it is so hard to find a loose comfortable tank top. So often they are tight fitting, so I was happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band. I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but reviews said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sports bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute.  The color was exactly how it looked in the picture. I am glad I opted for the medium cause this does appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it makes it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat. This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That was really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair ties that you can only use once. I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pants and still looks great. You can really even use it as a bathing suit cover if you would like. Please note I received this product at a free or reduced price for my honest review. The above review is my honest opinion and not hindered or influenced in any way. I hope you found my review to be helpful, if you have please check the box yes below.

We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website, but to our surprise when we arrived, our names were nowhere to be found in their system! No room, no accommodations at the restaurant, nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked, and never did they offer us a replacement dining option! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time. We will never be staying here again."

1,"I have a small blender that has a wide range of functions, and this is the first one I've used.  The motor is easy to use, and the motor is very quiet.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the blades with a single hand.  I just have to pull the blades away from the blade, and it will eventually melt.  The blades have a nice twist-able handle.  I love that they are made of glass.  I will be purchasing more of these.  The blades are very sharp, and the blade spring is very firm.  I love that the blades are made of glass.  I like that they have a clear plastic backing.  I have also purchased the metal blades for my next blender.  I love the fact that the blades have a very soft edge.  I use these to slice a lot of vegetables and salads.  I love the fact that they are made of glass.  I love that the blades have a very soft feel to them.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  I also love the fact that they have a nice, smooth feel to them.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend these blades.I bought this to protect my coffee cup from frosting and baking.  The cup is sturdy and a great value.  I have tried several other types of coffee makers but never had any issues with it.  I have used the same cup for almost all the types of coffee I have used and the coffee still tastes great.  I am very happy with this product."
0,"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights. Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this. Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use. Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down. Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.  I want to note that the vendor I bought from (they sell through Amazon, so this is appropriate to mention), The Best Things, is a good company and I would not hesitate to give them my business.  But I cannot recommend the Nobex saw."

0,"I read this book all of the way through. He explains a lot of things about quantum physics and other related subjects thoroughly. In fact, it was the most concise explanation for the new scientific discoveries that I have read in one book. But where the author goes wrong, in my opinion, is when he acts as though the Law of Attraction and its related theories work to make you wealthy. He says that all you have to do is have positive thinking and you will attract wealth and other great things into your life. The reason why I have singled out wealth is because he does. He believes that you can become a millionaire and even a billionaire if you use the Law of Attraction correctly.  After talking and talking about his concepts I jumped ahead to the author's story. I wanted to see what the Law of Attraction had brought into his life. He said he was doing well with his software company but he lost everything. Immediately after losing everything he wrote this book. I had to laugh! What better proof that the author didn't know what he was talking about can be inferred by his situation? Naturally, if his concepts worked he would be a successful billionaire by now! If you want to read about the recent revelations about quantum physics this is an excellent book to read. Other than that, at least it was free."

1,"Something I never expected when I bought it. I was expecting a lot of the same stuff. The top is a nice, solid piece of wood and the cover is very sturdy. It is hard to get the carpet out of the car if you don't have a lot of room. I have a few of them in the house and they are a little rough. I just put them on the floor and it is nice and smooth. I would not have given it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that the cover is not quite as thick as the carpet. I am happy with it and am happy with the price. It is a very good product for the price. The only negative is that I can't find a box of these for the price. I have only used them once so far and they are very good quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Very nice looking. I have not used it yet but I will update when I do. I got this for my daughter's first birthday party. She loves it!  I was very happy with the size and the quality. It is made from sturdy bamboo. I was able to use it on the bed and it is great to hold."
0,"The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. No - not a bit worn - very much so I'm sorry to say. Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave. can't be beat, and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons, there were quite a few bumps in the road. Number one, the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. The desk chair was so badly worn that the 'lift' button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese. The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth, one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink, so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. The towels were very well worn and thin, although bath sized, which was a plus. The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say, it was horrific. We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables, and they (appetizers) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side, served on a large white plate, and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. Even the menu, as limited as it was, looked as though someone's child had written it out. The good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. Unfortunately for us, the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $325/nt for our disappointments. The good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a $4 beer anywhere in a hotel? (even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol!~) The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful, and the bed comfortable. The A/C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever, and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay. Free wi-fi - YES! And it wasn't horribly grindingly slow! No need for the advertised 'upgrade' for faster wi-fi. Talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game. Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased, but we were sadly not."

The other reviewer points out the best or worst case example:  If you plug aquarium equipment into this, and the power goes out, even for a blink, you must press the reset button to restore power to the equipment.  A lamp would be another bad thing to plug into this, since you would have to find and press the reset button to turn the lamp back on.

0,"After viewing these 4 films once again, I realize how important some twentieth century films are to our understanding of ourselves, our religons, the way we love one another, and the way we deal with death. The artistry is within every frame. There is one interview documentry with Bergman in 1998 with one of his assocites, it is clear that as Bergman got older and older, he wanted to dis-associate himself from these early acheivements. Why? He states that although he knew he was master of the medium (and theater as well)that his personal life, was just a series of bitter disappointments ending with the death of his last wife, Ingrid I beleive. So, he assumed himself to be just an anonymous technician, or at least that's what he wished. The only compliant I have is that the subtitles are inside of the visual image instead of being letter boxed and the subtitles are sloppily inserted. Not up to Criterion criteria. One new observation is that the ensamble cast that Bergman uses throughout most of these films are one of the reasons these movies are the classics that they are. Lastly, Bergman films aren't made to be watched once and discarded, they are made to be re-inestigated year-in and year-out."

0,"It's small (under 2"" side to side) including the diffuser and just over 1"" for the light part. Sure it puts out heat but the diffuser reduces it somewhat and after all it is for halogen lamps.  I have only seen hot ones.  For me, it serves a special purpose by lighting that small area I use for tedious work such as watch repair and fine soldering on tiny electrical things (the scientific word defined as stuff).  While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.  The most important element in this lamp is that it is LED and that makes up for a bunch of missing information."

0,"I purchased this product and there was no option in the tools menu to change the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3.  When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it.  When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.  Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.  Between the bad product and bad attitude, this company deserves to go broke."

The HK Porter has a maximum opening of nearly 1/2"" (7/16ths of an inch at the very top of the V opening) which means it opens more than twice as wide as the Tekton.  There is enough strength to cut through framing nails (.131"" or thereabouts) with little difficulty; wood screws cut like butter.  Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.  The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade."

So she gets grant money to go study some bears in the woods of Virginia for a year.  Then we have King and Rogue. 2 very alpha bears who shouldn't exist but obviously they do. Their clan has had all the women and adult men taken, so King and Rogue are the only 2 left to take care of all the cubs. King is stuck in tradition and believes they will help their clan survive while Rogue goes and does normal human activities when ranging and believes traditions should be in the past.  Needless to say Jill is saved by Rogue and she is marked and is now being told she is a mate.

0,"The length of a book is probably irrelevant to its greatness, but in this case, at least, it imposed a great burden.  I'm a pretty quick reader, but after a recent weekend of off-and-on perusing, I found that I had covered only 51 pages of this gargantuan novel, and that it was difficult to go further in view the slow unfolding of this tale.  I seriously wonder about the high praises bestowed by Stephen King and Richard Russo on the back cover--I may come back to this weighty tome at a later date--perhaps when I have much more time to devote to it.  Yet, I must consider that many of the reviewers on this site have given this work mixed reviews.  And unfortunately, several revealed that the ending was a ""Bummer"".  A definite spoiler and disincentive IMHO."

This set contains all the episodes for season one. Not a bad deal and an amazing boxset design to boot. PS: Please don't buy the bootleg DVD's on ebay.

I have read all of the books in this series, so I am glad that I did"
0,"This book really hit home and won me over because you could just HEAR the pain in Streeps voice as you read the passages. I find it difficult to believe that Streep was able to get through this book without some tears. But that's what made it such a real, resonating read. Streep covers her own experiences from young girlhood to adulthood. She backs up her position with plenty of research, and testimonies from other women. Although her writing weaves from one person to another and one time period to another, it flows quite well.  I praise streep for this book. I think anyone who felt unloved as a child ( and still as an adult ) will appreciate this. Because the phenomenom of unloving mothers is so largely hidden,it has taken a while for people to recognise it. Streep is one of the brave pioneers who, in recent years, has tackled this topic. My hope is to use this knowledge and not repeat the cycle with my own daughter. Also recommended: The Art of Quitting. Only halfway through but very good!"

If I did pick something I wasn't overly fond of it would be the size of the bottom and top bowls. I have a 5 pound dog so the bowls were a little to big for him to eat comfortably. I just brought along two small bowls for my dog to use so it really want an issue for me. You do have to take the handle off in order to open the container. I like that because it made me feel like it was added protection from spilling. If you li,e to travel with your pet and are looking for a way to keep everything together I would recommend this product."

1,I enjoyed my stay at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago. The staff was friendly and helpful from the time I checked in all the way through checkout. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. The beds were very comfortable! The hotel restaurant/lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day. The only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel. I reccomend this hotel and I will stay there again on my next trip to Chicago!
1,"I got a color scrub and it was just as described.  I also have a hard time finding a pair of sandals that run a bit small, and these are great.  The color is beautiful and the material is soft.  I wish I had gotten"
1,Amazing!! My 18+ year old African Greyhound loves it. I will keep it for the next couple of months. Great price! I will definitely order again!I bought this for my puppy's tank. It is a good size for her size. I use it for her water bowl and a 2 gallon aquarium. I also use it for the tank with a 3 gallon tank. It has a nice scoop to keep it fresh.
1,"Troy is a Chicago cop who has been with the FBI for a long time. She's just starting to get into the detective business, and she is running out of ideas. She's been with the FBI since she was a teenager, and she's learned how to handle the FBI. She's a woman who's lost the most of her self-confidence and self-esteem. She's a very smart, independent woman, and she's on a mission to find the killer. She's determined to find him, and the only way she knows how is to go undercover.  I enjoyed the book and the characters, and I was a little confused at first. It took awhile for me to get used to the whole mystery. I loved how the author didn't let us read all of the clues and the little details that she made into a book. I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next.  It was a great read, and I really enjoyed the characters. The main character, Colton, was very interesting, and I found myself rooting for him to find the killer. It was a great read, and I would recommend it.  I received an ARC of this book in exchange"
0,"We use on the door that goes to the garage to keep hats and mittens in and on the door of our baby girls' room to keep her little matching outfits in.  I like that the pockets are mesh in case items that are damp are place in there so that they can dry.  I don't see much of a point to the double pocket.  The hangers that came with it are useless as they do not fit over ANY door that is in our house.  I ended up spending about as much money on 3M command hooks to hang it as I did on the organizer itself, but it works."
0,"This is one of Angelina Jolie's best films; everbody in this film plays thier roles exceptionally well. The plot is very well crafted and the action stupendous, although somewhat unbelievable. The portent of the film changes somewhat during its course, making the film even more attractive; this is definately worth viewing twice."
0,"Tested it against a glass floated version and it was very close to temperature. Another bonus is, you can rearrange-move it as needed. I use this on both of my tanks. Even if one degree off in either way, it's more important that you keep the temperature consistent when changing your water. Good-quality product."
1,"This is one of my favorite containers, and it is very sturdy.  It's been used to make two cupcakes and I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have"
0,"I almost passed this book after reading the synopsis with ""orphan"".  The rise of an orphan into the world is a familiar story.  This one does it better than most.  His circumstances aren't milked for pity.  It is a pleasure to try to find words to describe the ways in which this story delivers some twists and uniqueness which makes it fresh.  Looking forward to the author's next book."
1,I ordered these for my son. He loves them. He also loves the way they are made. He is very happy with the product.
0,I LOVE EM!.  I bought a size 8 and they fit fine but with no extra space at the heel and just a 1/4 inch of space between my toe and the edge of the shoe.  8.5 could have fit me too.  It would be a question of how you prefer your shoes to fit.  They are bouncy soft through the whole sole.  I am going to wear them for my entire vacation.  I will definitely buy another pair of artisan Clarks.
1,"I had one from another time. The only reason I didn't buy this one was because the other one had a very dimmable LED bulb. The light output was so great, it was impossible to adjust it. I even had to change it from the"

1,"My dog kills the squeakers, but the squeakers are too loud.My dog loves this stuff.I bought this for a friend's cat and she's a huge fan of it. It's a little hard to get on the floor, but it's very sturdy and holds up very well. I'm not sure if the squeakers are the problem or not, but they're great. I just wish there was a way to remove the metal bars. I think I'll buy another one for when I get my cat back.I bought this for"

0,"The small size (10L) is a perfect fit for my Kelty Cosmic Down 20 degree sleeping bag. This sack is tough and well built, but a little heavy compared to other options. Mine measures 5.44 oz on a kitchen scale. The zipper pocket hasn't been useful, you can't get anything into or out of it when the sack is compressed. Overall it's a nice piece of gear and should last a long time."
1,Love them. Said to order an XL. Not sure if they fit just right or not.
1,"I've never needed an oven thermometer, but I've found it handy for cooking in the oven.  I had a similar model before and used it a couple of times, and now it's a little smaller.  I think it's going to be a great addition to the kitchen.I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent.  I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain.  I like that they are so easy to wash.  I've washed the towels in the dishwasher and they still look great!  I'm super happy with my purchase!These are very soft and absorbent.  I love how they work.I have been using this to keep my clothes dry for a long time and I like it. It has a good grip on the fabric and doesn't move around. I like that it is on the floor so I don't have to worry about it being stuck on the floor. It is very light weight and very comfortable.  I would highly recommend this product.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would not be buying this again.  I have purchased several similar products from this company. They are well made and well made. I bought a small plastic towel in the middle of the bathtub and it was too small to use. I received a plastic towel with a strip of tape that is thicker than a regular towel. The tape is thin and the material is very soft"

0,This is a slim case designed for all models of the iPad mini. The mini snaps into the pressure fit back and has magnetic three-section lid that turns the iPad of and on automatically. Good case with good value.
1,"Well, my two cats wouldn't eat it, but they love it.  I have a large one.I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive ear. She had no issues with it, but she had some ear infections and some irritation in her ear. I put it on her and it stopped her ear infection and it did not come back. I did not want to give it to a dog that was too sensitive and sensitive to ear cleaning"
