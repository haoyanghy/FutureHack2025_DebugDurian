0,"I never read this kind of material, but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down.  Not dry or boring in any way, Levitt has the reader looking at the world in ways never imagined.  This is not about economics at all, more about sociology and how things that we believe are linked are not and how other occurrences do have connection.  Read the first chapter and see if you can put it down!  I recommend it highly because it challenges your thinking."
1,This is an outstanding historical novel. The characters are well developed and the plot is well developed. The story is told from the point of view of the reader. This book is very interesting and it is well worth the time. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in history.This is a fast read with a great twist. I had to wait a few days to finish it. I was quite surprised to see that the author is now a professor of history at UC Berkeley. I am very happy to be a part of her work. I am also very happy to be a part of the team that provided the documentation that allowed us to review the book. We were very excited about this book as it was well worth the time it took to read. It was an easy read and I was very pleased with the outcome. I look forward to reading more of the authors work.Very good story.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable.I love this book.  I have read all the books in the series and would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read
1,"This gritty cop series is a real treat.  The characters are believable, the acting is solid, and the movie is a true story.  The acting is superb.  The movie is worth watching.

0,"I usually wear a size small, but I have bigger thighs and a butt for being 5'7"" and 125lbs.  After reading other reviews I thought it would be best to order a size up and I was right.  The M/L fit perfectly and I usually wear a size 4-5.  Otherwise they are good quality and super soft!"
0,I bought this reel based on Alan Hawks review.  I strung this reel with 300Yds. of 100Lb. Power Pro. After fighting bull reds in the surf with this reel I have to say this reel is a tank. Exceeds my expectations. I would have given this reel five stars for price point but will need to see the reels longevity and durability to rate it that high. I will say everything Alan reviewed to be true. If  you have never fought bull reds in the surf Ill just say it qualifies for hard use. This reel is not refined but is very well made. I would trust it over my much more expensive Shimano reels for big game. The drag is unbelievable and can handle heavy tackle. I wish I would have bought two of these reels because now you cant find one and the prices have already gone up 20%. I REEEEALLY hope the quality does not go down on this reel because I believe Fin-Nor has hit a home run with this one. I fish this reel next to five Shimanos in the Texas gulf.

0,"As a recent new cat person, I purchased this for my cat to have a place to scratch, perch, and play. My cat was immediately interested in this condo, even as I was putting it together. Assembly wasn't too hard, I just followed what another reviewer had suggested and used a picture for reference. It should be noted that this unit is kind of HUGE. It is very tall! While the size works just fine for where I have it located, make sure to check the dimensions of your space before purchasing.  A few months after adopting my first cat, I adopted a second one. Both cats, each around 8 pounds, love to jump from the different perches. Though all the screws are tightened (something I check monthly as they tend to loosen over time), the whole thing does shake when they are running around on it. This does not seem to bother the cats, and therefore does not bother me. This unit has lived on hardwood floors and carpeting, neither flooring seems to aid or reduce in the amount of shaking. My cats do not spend much time in either cubby space, they mostly make use of the perches. While I love the blue color of this unit, it does highlight the amount of cat hair left behind. I vacuum the condo about once every 1-2 weeks.  I have had this unit for about 9 months and it has suffered a bit of damage. The highest perch is the most popular, and thus has suffered some minor shredding/tearing of the blue carpeting. The top hanging mouse has not survived, but the lower one is still hanging on. Finally, the base of the unit suffered some damage from my robot vacuum. I now block off the condo so that he cannot climb up it anymore (obviously not the cat trees fault).  Overall I think this is a great cat condo, and every time I see my cats playing on it, I feel happy."

1,"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever. First, when I went to check in, I was completely ignored by the staff, they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in. When I got to my room, all the way on the 23rd floor, the room was dirty and had not been cleaned. So back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room. I went back to check and the new room was dirty also. There were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom. It appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean. All I can say is YUCK! My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN! Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms. I felt like I was staying at a $30 a night roach motel, not the $250 a night Sheraton. My advise is to stay away."

It is great to say a command once, and get a response, versus yelling across the yard multiple times to get her attention.  It charges quickly.  The only issue I have had is that the collar will go in sleep mode and sometimes not respond to the remote. Not sure how this is happening as she is very active.

0,"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot. With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered. Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband? As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years. Ms. Wainscott's latest is a masterpiece of mystery, chock full of suspense, and brimming with romantic attraction. Readers unfamiliar with this rising star's work will definitely want to check out this latest suspenseful novel."
0,"After reading some of the most recent reviews I'm really perplexed. I didn't know what to expect, but I was most pleasantly surprised. Just as all the past reviews, both negative and positive, have stated, you can't beat the location of this hotel. It's perfect. We had a big spacious room in the old tower. We avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge. The beds were great, the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly. Great martinis in the hotel bar. I really can't understand the negative reviews. I know you can't please everyone, but in some cases I simply don't believe their claims. I've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels. This is a great hotel!"

1,"This real life story has some interesting characters.  The characters are believable and the story is full of surprises.  This is the story of a young woman who goes to a very large college with a beautiful older man in a dress.  He wants to be an excellent teacher and teaches the people in his class how to do it.  He spends the first half of the book in a different college town, but then goes to another college.  He goes to college in a different town and his father is a college professor.  He does a very good job of teaching them how to do it.  They learn that there are some things that are not true and that there is something wrong with them.  They learn to deal with things like this and they are not happy with it.  They also learn that the people in their class are not happy with the teachers.  They don't really know what to do with themselves.  They are unhappy with the people in their class and they are afraid that the people in their class will say something that they don't like.  The real life story is more about the people in their class and how they deal with it.  It's not all about the teachers.  It's about the people in their class.

This book touches many emotions starting from the opening of the story. It catches you by surprise. There was no warning of what was coming. The opening was executed with precision leaving me a bit stunned. And then there is the promise dictated by the Book of Hours- find true love; something most of us want, so it keeps you reading and digging your heels in. This book has some of everything-love, desire, betrayal and even show biz.

It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.  Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!  All in all, not worth the money. It's a good idea, just poorly made."

0,"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher."

0,"For once, I did know the mystery since the beginning (I'm not usually that good), even if I didn't know who was the culprit. But to me, that wasn't a spoiling of the enjoyment of reading the story, cause there were many points I deeply appreciated, two out of them, the love story and the setting.  The setting was faboulos, and considering I love that Gilded Age atmosphere, and I usually try to visit at least one of those villas each time I'm in the US, I was fascinated like Griff by the architecture, and I believe the description of the lives of who was lucky enough to grew up among those walls was spot on. And the there was Pierce, so handsome and aloof, but only at first glance, cause he is the one initiating the spark between Griff and him, and once fire took place, it's hot. The sex scenes, when happening, were at the same time erotic but classy, perfectly in character with the protagonists, and again, the setting.  I often say that, but I have to say it again, once you read a novel by Josh Lanyon you have the best of two worlds, the romance and the mystery/thriller."

I mean, really, what an amazing story!  [. ]  [. ]  I read this book in the middle of the night, and I'm a bit nauseated by the fact that I'd been reading it for about two hours. I wasn't sure what the story was about, but I guess it just made me feel better about myself. It was great. I just didn't want to put it down. The story was all about the very first person, and that is exactly what I wanted. The character development, the characters, the world building. There is a lot of blood, but that doesn't detract from the story. It was a lot more focused on the main character, and the relationship between him and her. It was a good read, and a great story.

I was a little boy, and remember seeing this movie at the movies. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's got a good plot, and it's got a good ending. I will watch it again.

0,"Chameleon is the tale of a planned alien invasion and an army team's effort to halt it. Although ostensibly part of a series, it is fine as a stand-alone story. After an ominous prologue in 1925 we fast-forward to the present and to a military base located on an island from where a helicopter full of people destined for a mainland vacation takes off. Meanwhile, things go very wrong and the chopper returns to the island with all its passengers plus some military brass. From this point on the copter passengers are in a fight for survival against overwhelming odds. They can't possibly win ... or can they? The book is well-written. Although I felt it was a wee bit slow in getting underway, when it did take off it was a whirlwind! The characters: plastic (in more ways than one), credible, with some likable and others less so - as in the real world. I definitely recommend this book!"

However if you have long haired dogs such as German Shepherds, Huskies, etc topical flea treatments may not work well for you. I use this on my Jack Russells and haven't seen a single flea or tick and been using it for years. When I used it on my Huskies though I don't think it was able to get down to the skin well and I still saw fleas/ticks, so I use Trifexis for them, an oral flea preventative. I'll keep buying this from Amazon. It is definitely the real product, no knock off or imitation. Looks exactly the same as when I buy it at the vet's office."

0,"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.  The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.  You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.

0,My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock for safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.

0,"Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion.

0,"One finds out pretty clearly and directly who the murderer is about midway through the book.  At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish.  That requires attention to pacing with matters picking up and slowing down.  That's what made Da Vinci Code such a good read as well Le Carre' novels like Tinker, Tailor.... That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work.  And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr!  Puh-leeze!  Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off.  Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before.  What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end."

Second, I tried the propeller guards on and spun the propellers by hand and one for the propellers would rub against the guard. So I tried charging the battery and was going to fly it without propeller guards, landing skids, and without the camera. Plugged the battery in and the drone never got power, no signal to the transmitter either. Tried calling their customer service (which was found on groupon) and they ask to send an email or leave a message. First I tried wrinting an email and after a week I never received a response, then tried calling and leaving a message and after 2 weeks I never received a response. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Beware of this hoax company. I will now try and google for company webpages before making any further purchases, regarding drone manufacturers. The cherry on top, after handling the body of the drone, the company name smeared from the palm of my hand. Very cheap and not worth the money. This would have been my 5th drone to play with, I have also built my own drones as well. Never had any other issues with other quadcopter companies. Since you can't find a company address or contact a customer service representative, I will probably order a new flight contoller and get it to fly myself, would hate the whole investment to go in the garbage."

0,"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.  Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time."

0,"What can I say? I've heard about this film for years, and I finally got to watch it the other day. It was one of the best cinematic experiences that I have ever had!  There isn't much in the way of a plot - a struggling father and husband buys a new bicycle in order to carry out the duties of his new job, the bike is taken away buy a passing thief, and the father and his son go out into the poverty stricken streets of Italy to find it.  However, it is a journey that they will never forget, as they bond with one another, and the father's weaknesses are ultimately exposed out of an act of desperation. It is an ultimately heartbreaking ending that caps off one of the best films that I have ever seen.  You owe it to yourself to see this one. Thank God that the people at Criterion cleaned it up, and gave it the DVD release that it deserves."

I have already purchased 3 other trays and the PetLoo and this is by far the one that worked best for me and my puppies. My two small dogs play a lot and if they happen to skid on the tray while running, the pad would move and they would grab it and rip it apart! Also, my Pomeranian has a liver condition and as a result he drinks a ton of water and pees a lot! So he always ends up with wet paws, which meant he wet the floor every time he used the pee pad. With this tray, I don't have to worry about pee pads getting ripped and my floor has never been cleaner. If only they would make this tray in a bigger size, like 36x24 (90cmx60cm) size! PLEASE!!"

0,"This movie is a must have for the fans of Sally Field and James Gardner.  It's a fun look at an older man in love with a younger woman.  Sally is excellent in the role of Emma, a recently divorced woman who is also trying to make it alone as a rancher.  Murphy (played by James) is the older gentlemen who is attracted to Emma when she arrives in town with her son.  When Emma's ex shows up the two men vie for Emma which results in some funny situations.  I would rate this movie PG-13 because of the mild sexual content. Great chick flick with a terrific cast."

I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use.

I loved the characters, the story, and the plot. I enjoyed the story immensely. I was especially drawn to the heroine and her family."
0,"What a terrible end to this series.  I loved this character and her gargoyles from the first novella that I read but this book was technical with almost no heart or development for the few characters there were.  I was completely bored with the formation of crystals and what it took to form the crystals.  I felt like I was in a cave forming crystals through out most of the book.  That is what I mean by the book being too technical.  If there was such a thing as gargoyles, this would be the manual on how to make your own gargoyle. The writer spent way too much time on that and not enough time on developing the romance and bringing life to the final story in this series.  I miss the people and the gargoyles from the previous books.  This book felt like a novella that was dragged out."

First, when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked. Room service took forever and the food was subpar. Supposedly they had planners to help explore the area, but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner. The spa staff seemed incompetent. The only positive things I can say about Amalfi Hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised. I give this hotel two stars."
0,"I needed white balloons specifically for a birthday party craft.  When these arrived, I was a little concerned because they looked very yellow.  I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."

0,"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.  Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.  3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling."

1,"Let preface my review by stating that I am very disappointed in this product. I have used this product before and had no issues with it. The plastic part on the back is very thin and it does not hold up well to the biting. This is a very thin plastic with no edge. I have to leave it on the floor and it goes out of the way. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this product. This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they can't chew it up!  This is a great product for dogs that have chewed it up too. We bought this for a puppy that had chewed up a huge chunk of his front teeth. It's a bit flimsy, but it's sturdy enough to keep him from chewing on it. It's a bit on the smaller side for the size of a small dog. It's a little stiff for a small dog, but it's worth it for her to chew on it. The only downside is that it's not very easy to clean, and I find that it doesn't hold up well for her to chew on. I don't use this product on my dogs, but I do recommend it. I got this for my dog and she loves it. I bought it for her to be able to lay on a couch."

The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.  In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!  I think this book has been an excellent investment for me, and I hope it is for many of you too."
1,"Written as an introduction to the characters and the plot. I will admit that I was a bit nervous about reading this story, but I was intrigued by the beginning of the story and it was worth the wait. It was a quick read that had me wanting more. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good romance and it will make you smile and cry with you.I love this series. It has all the elements I love to read about. I loved the main characters. The story line is great. The characters are great. I loved reading this book. I am so looking forward to the next book.I really enjoyed this book. It's a little slow in the beginning but I enjoyed it and was happy to see it finished. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.This is a very good story with good characters.

0,"Installed it on my Mitsubishi Outlander with Pioneer AVIC Z140BH head unit. Image quality is great at night or day. Doesn't cause the image to blow out when a car is driving behind you with their headlights on. Nice feature to allows ""tow view"" when using it with the Pioneer GPS Mode. Allows you to see your trailer etc while you drive.  CONS: - Doesn't offer backup guide overlay like other cameras (dont know how useful it is, but would be nice to have the option) - Doesn't offer multiple view angles like the Alpine units - The curve of the lens seems to let water drops build up more when it gets wet which blocks and blurs the image. My camera is installed in the OEM hole that is drilled under the tailgate bar so its more protected and concealed, but I'm sure not all cars have this so the camera would be more exposed to the elements."

It worked for everything, boating was safe, in the pool he was able to float face up comfortably, but we didn't use it in the beach not for any reason, just we were holding him and it seemed excessive.

This is definitely way smaller than the standard 20g nose ring. It's more like 24g. If you wear the 20g rings currently, this one will probably fall out. I'd suggest tapering down but getting a 22g first for several months so your piercing can shrink a little."
1,"I'm not sure why some people say the design is just too smooth.  I think it's because the two top screws are too small.  The other top screws are too large and the screws aren't in the right places.  The glue on the bottom screws is very thin.  I don't think this is the case with the M-16.  I've had the M-16 for a few months now and it is working fine.  It's very easy to open and close the bolt when I'm doing my pull-up bar.  I haven't had a problem with it closing.

1,"My family's seven day stay at the InterContinental Chicago hotel was more than I could ever imagine. The InterContinental is more fantastic than any previous hotel I have visited, because of its wonderful amenities, such as the excellent 24 hour room service, access to personal trainers,and even a dry cleaning service, just to mention a few. My family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary American cuisine at the hotels Zest Restaurant, which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price. My most favorite point about the InterContinental Chicago is that it provides entry right into the Windy City, where my family and I had immediate access to transportation, shopping, and city attractions. We had a great time traveling through Chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice, clean, elegant, safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day. The InterContinental is a must stay and I will recommend them to anyone who plans on visiting Chicago."

Thank goodness the window opened or we'd have been cooked alive. That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave. This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting. Room was stuffy too. Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions. Wife happy w/ Aveda in bath. Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey.

I also know that in the East there is a history of suicidal protests like 1) Buddhist monk burned himself to death in 1960's Vietnam, 2) girls burning themselves protesting their husbands in Afghanistan, 3) Japanese jumping off cliffs with babies in arms because they feared the Americans at end of WWII, 4) Japanese samurai's hary cary, 5) 17 suicides in Chinese factory in 2 years because of poor working conditions.

It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.  I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!"

He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.  The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal."

0,"We love Playmobil! This set is really cute and lots of fun. The only part we didn't care for is some of the pieces don't stay attached, so we are having to reassemble some of the parts every time we want to use it. We still like it and it won't keep us from purchasing Playmobil in the future."
1,"i have bought this movie, it is an excellent addition to my collection!This movie was one of the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  There was a lot of bad language, and there was a lot of bad acting.  This movie is still one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  I don't think I've seen a bad movie in my life, but I'm sure it is.  I don't think I'll ever watch it again.  It's not worth watching, but I'm not going to put it down.  I've seen a few good movies, but this"

0,"First off you must know that it has a plastic lining in it so it is rain resistant.  Second you must know that it holds a lot of stuff and will get heavy about your second mile.  Third you must know that it is a great pack.  It does have some fraying on the mesh pocket on the outside but other than that it is great.  It is a good deal for the price."
1,"It is super small. I use it as a night light for my work, just in case. Great product. Great price. I am using it for the instruction booklet. Great light, nice color. It is a good value. I use this as a battery replacement. The battery is a bit smaller than I expected and it is very heavy. I think this is the perfect size to carry around with me when I am camping. I like that it is not bulky and it is easy to carry. The included batteries are nice and easy to store. This is a great tool and a great value."

0,"Computer speakers always seem very expensive for as crappy as they are.  You can get great speakers for your car for easily under $100.  While they are adequate, high quality sound should not be expected.  They do work though and are reasonably stylish.  They could have used a little longer cable.  I had to put left on right and right on left to reach my tower which sits to the left of my desk.  The speakers are mounted a little high on the hutch though."

0,Belkin seems to be the one company that comes out with the best tablet covers.  This Samsung cover is not bulky but with giving you a good amount of protection.  It is bendable so that you can stand your tablet while multi tasking leaving you hands free to do whatever it is you need to do.  I got a black one and it is the basic color for everyone to use.  I would have liked to see better grips on the inside to hold my tablet with but this will do for now.

0,"While I am definitely sad to see this series end, this book was everything I have come to love about the series and more.  I was a little worried at the beginning, but in the end, I loved every second of it.  There was the drama we love and humor to break the tenseness.  I don't want to give anything away with specifics, but it was absolutely a perfect ending.  The addition of Fallon to this cast of characters was perfect.  I love her so much!"
0,I love how you can cut them to fit whatever size wire you are bundling.  I have an external USB port on my desk and the bundles of wire are varying in size.  These worked great.  I also was able to cut a nice small length for my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength more than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.
0,"I finally got to apply this to a new pair of shoes.  Unfortunately, the cap/nozzle had come off in shipping.  I figured no big deal and put it back on.  But once I started spraying this, I ended up with a ton of it just running down the sides of the can.  So yes, my shoes are great, but it's frustrating I lost so much of the material running down the sides while I was spraying it.  Apparently the nozzle couldn't just be put right back on, though I've done it without a problem on other aerosol cans.  Wish I hadn't waited to use it on new shoes as now return period is past."
1,"My two daughters received these and they are very well made. I also have a large one. The top is a nice, solid and clear plastic and the inside is very soft. They are great for swim practice and they do not scratch the water. They also have a rubber seal to protect them from the sun. They are made well and I am very happy with them. I would not buy again. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary. I'm glad I found a better one."
0,"I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 in most sandals, but I ordered an 8 due to reading the reviews.  I am so glad that I did.  They fit just fine. After one day, I got an abrasion to the top of my foot from the sandals.  I am not sure if it was because of the amount of walking I did, or were they shoes too closely fitted?  I have only worn them once, and I walked for quite a bit on the first day.  They were very comfortable and the nice lining helps your feet to not sweat.  So far so good, with exception of a small cut on top of each of my feet.  Hopefully it is just having to break the shoes in one day.  August 2014...Months later... these must be the worst Born sandals purchase ever.  Every pair I have purchased have been worn and worn.  However, the top strap of the shoe digs into the top of your foot.  I even had my daughter try them since she has smaller feet than me, and the top rubs slightly against the top of your feet when walking.  If you do not do a lot of walking, these shoes may be for you.  However, the top strap will rub gently, at first, into the top of your foot.  After a few hours, that gently part will start to form redness on your feet.  I never had Born shoes that did that to my feet before.  Maybe I just got a bad pair because it is mostly just the left shoe."
0,"Rodney Yee is one of the best.  I do have 2 of his other dvd's and yet this is truly advanced and not recommended for those with flexibility issues or those who haven't tried yoga before.  This is truly an advanced dvd and whilst it is excellent (because it will give you a great workout and because Rodney is so professional), if you aren't a big yoga person or have trouble getting and staying in some of the usuall yoga positions, then this isn't for you.  I've done some yoga before and thought I could challenge myself with this, but it's still pretty tough.  Not for everyone."

The colors are nice and the horses look great in the barn. The size is perfect and the barn is very small. We have 2 horses with the same color and the horses are very well made.

0,"I listened to this audio book this week & found it to be very enjoyable.  The history of ""The Pythons"" is given in the voices of those who lived it (although at times, the audio quality leaves much to be desired).

0,"The fit is more or less fine, though the lack of choices for inseam sucks. The drawstring legs are useless, and beyond stupid. I just jerked out the drawstrings and cuffed the legs for now until I can have them hemmed properly.  Not a fan of the useless pockets below the knee, either. Anything you put in there is going to flop around and be general pain in the ass, so why even bother putting a huge cargo pocket there? a small tight fitting pocket there would have been a better choice, but... Again, useless and stupid."

Many things happen with dealing with this disease; some very sad, some a bit scared, and some happy.  Very good story and definitely worth reading."

0,"So far so good! I have been using the darker moon light style Exo Terra bulbs for years and years with our 55 gallon tank for a 4-foot California King Snake. Unfortunately there must be a design flaw with them as they seem to blow out every 3-4 months or so and at $9/bulb it gets annoying!  The reviews on this said that they last for a long long time so I am hoping this really keeps going for a while!  I liked the darker blacklight style of the other one as it was dimly lit. This literally lights up the entire 55 gallon tank it is super bright and then lights up the floor around it. Pretty cool looking bulb and supposedly throw heat down towards the snake up to 16 inches. He seems to be more active when this light is on. Hopefully it does not harm him at all."

The chef obviously knew what he was doing, I especially loved the seafood, my personal favorite was the shrimp. Aside from this, I loved how beautiful the hotel was. It is definetly a bargain for the price, for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but, I felt as if i was in a $10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe. great bang for your buck. Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. My friends actually went their a while back because of me. They loved it! I know you will too."

It has great characters and plot.  I felt like I was in the story.  It's very realistic.  I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt, but I'm not sure why.  I'm sure it was because the book is so different from other books in the series.  I think it's because I have read the other books.  It's a different story than I've read all of the other books.

0,"The single DVD version with the concept of the ""probes"" being sent from a future human race was a very upbeat and inovative plot device for this vision of Earth-after-man. That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away! So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied. While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions. The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations. Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting ""FIRE"" long after the smoke has cooled. So be it. This is one of the very few times that the more intellectual cut was all wrong. The US versions were much better films in every way; repeat footage and all. You were viewing events,not ideas. It might have sold better too."

0,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.  I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."
0,"I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site."

0,"The film brings to the screen the story of two cowboys out of New Mexico who come to NY looking for their friend who's gone missing while searching for his daughter.  It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with significant elements of comedy.  To a certain extent it brings to mind Next of Kin starring Patrick Swayze.  Woody Harrelson, Kiefer Sutherland, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music, are all WONDERFUL!  The Cowboy Way is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"
0,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I'm shocked that more people don't know about it, and even more shocked that it never received a proper DVD release.  This movie is hilarious -- definitely a ""Spinal Tap"" for country music....but it's not a rip-off of Spinal Tap.  Even if you aren't a fan of Country music, you should see this movie...it's funny and has a cast of some great actors/actresses.  I hope that this film someday sees the light of day (i.e. major distribution).  It was originally only available as a rental (or as a purchase on VHS) from Blockbuster.  But it's so much better than that.  In Summary:  A great parody that I can watch again and again."

0,"Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, with director Michel Hazanavicius, did something entirely different here, completely unlike their award-winning work in The Artist. It's hard to believe this movie features the same three brilliant people.  Dujardin is brilliant at dumb-cluck-worthy mannerisms and quirks. Chasing bad guys down the back alleys of Cairo? You'd expect our hero, as heroes often do in their more suave and debonair incarnations, to run swiftly and with no uncertainty around corners, never slowing down or stopping. Not Agent 117...he has to stop completely, in a tense, crouching stance, in which he pivots, to look all directions, before he continues...not once, not twice, but at every single corner or intersection in the chase.

0,"I've never read a book that so completely makes a mountain out of a molehill of non-existent ""evidence."" This book requires dozens of traitors to be involved(Marshall, Stark, etc. etc.), unless Stinnet thinks FDR was intercepting and decoding those msgs by his fireside using a English-Japanese dictionary and a copy of the Japanese codes. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming  and incontrovertible , both from participants as well as Japanese witnesses interviewed after the war that the author of this book is out to lunch, and trying to make a quick buck with a lurid tale. Even the logic of allowing the US fleet to be caught unaware makes no sense whatsoever - if the Japanese bomb Pearl arbor, whether it's ready or not, that means war. FDR would have gained absolutely nothing by allowing the attack to succeed. It also could have been far worse had the attack destroyed the fuel farms, which they would have except for Nagumo's trepidation. And that would have put the Pacific Fleet back on the West Coast and immobile for a year. Nor was their any reason to believe that Hitler would declare war on the US as a result, as claimed. The Japanese didn't go to war with Russia (which Hitler strongly wished) just because Japan's partner Germany had. So how is war with Japan going to result in a war with Germany? It depended on Hitler, who had no good reason to declare war on the US. He was stupid to have done so."

I would recommend this saw to anyone looking for a nice, solid saw that can be used for everyday tasks.  The other blades were a little rough, but not bad, so I was able to get it to do what"
0,"I have purchased several pairs of TRUFORM Firm Stay-Up Top Thigh High Compression Hose. My only complaints to date about them are (1) they are generally slightly too long and (2) they have no SIZE TAG sewn into the top band. Usually I buy a 20-30mmhg but on the advice of my cardiologist, I ordered this pair of X-LG.When the product arrived the box, like the picture was marked XL (which I have been buying for 4 years now based on my doctor's prescription). This pair of TRUFORM like the others I have bought in the past did not have a SIZE tag in them. However, I attempted to try them on and they are so SMALL  that I could not get them over my foot!.Obviously TRUFORM incorrectly packaged a SMALL in an XL package. So I will not buy TRUFORM again!"

0,"This really isn't even the same tool as the 2-ton cable puller.  I mean it is, but this thing is MASSIVE.  It weighs about 35 pounds and looks able to pull a house over.  The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.  This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate."

0,"This purchase was a nice replacement for my older Garmin nuvi 350.  I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.  I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new."

The pieces were very small. This is a great toy for the money. I have a 2 year old who can be very rough with this toy. I wish I would have paid more for the items that they are made of."
1,"Other reviews have described the book as ""the best"" of its kind, and I'm not.  I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.  The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.  I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.  I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.  Overall, I liked this book very much, and I'm not sure that I'll be reading any"

0,"I love PattyBoutik but I am on the fence on this one. I usually wear a S or M in most brands of shirts and for this shirt the small for this top fit perfect on me. I am 5'3"" at around 145lbs. I wanted something to cover my tummy area, but I'm torn because on one hand it fits great but on the other I worry it's too puffy looking in the front. My biggest fear though is with this color that sweat will easily show so I haven't worn it to photograph any hot weather weddings, which is why I bought it. The other thing is I feel like I need to tan with this color. It blends in with my skin tone so much that it looks nude on me and I'm so pail that I wish I got a different color. So all in all I may just wear this one around the house. BUT that has nothing to do with the product itself!  This fabric of this shirt feels so soft on the skin and washes nicely. I got it right away, shipping is fast and reliable. Wrapped up nicely makes you feel like it's a present! :) Will be buying more in the future regardless and other styles. Thank you once again for a great style PattyB!"

0,"A very interesting view into the mind and home life of Alfred Hitchcock. Anthony Hopkins once again acts his part so well that you forget it's him and just focus on the character. Helen Mirren is always excellent. Scarlett Johanssen tried to play Janet Leigh as smart and as professional as she was supposed to be - though I'm not sure she pulled it off. The actor portraying Anthony Perkins seemed to be playing Norman Bates rather than Anthony Perkins but perhaps there are more similarities there than I am aware. I was pleased that the Hitchcock's marriage was shown to be a loving, though imperfect, partnership and proved the saying, 'behind every good man is a great (and very tired) woman."

0,"I bought this book on a recommendation and though I gave up a few days of my life over it (and the next 2 in the series), I'm glad I did! The first two chapters were a bit slow-going, and I actually came back to the book about a month after I initially started it. However, once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The author constructs a wonderful world to set her story in and develops strong, interesting characters over the three books. In the first book, A Great and Terrible Beauty, she outlines her initial plot about a girl raised in colonial India but forced to move to a boarding school in late 19th century England after her mother is murdered. The intrigue, romance, fantastical elements, and believable scenery of England during that era make it an engaging tale. It is a great story, but also very well written. By the end of the book, I was carrying my Kindle everywhere and already anticipating buying the next installment in the series!"

I have noticed the reticle can get a little blurry and out of focus depending on the angle I look at it. It's also a little hard to see when it's really bright outside even at the highest brightness level. Still, it's quite a lot of functionality and performance for the price. I would definitely buy it again and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap optic for less precise work."

0,"Home Depot added a store brand line of lower-cost LED bulbs and put their Feit bulbs on the clearance rack. I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.  They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.  And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it. They're supposed to be 60W-equivalent, but the brightness is similar to 75W-equivalent LED bulbs.  Because they're so reasonably priced, I felt that I could use them to replace the CFL bulbs in my basement and the difference is incredible. The four ceiling fixtures in my basement have uncovered bulbs, so I appreciate the sturdiness of the Feit bulbs.  I bought these locally and on sale, but the regular price of under $20 for a package of six bulbs is very reasonable, given the quality of the bulbs.  If you want strong light (especially in a place where the bulb may be bumped into) I think these are an excellent choice."
1,"I love the brand and the colors and the materials. I will definitely buy again!Very nice. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up. The little one will probably love it for a while. I would buy this again, but maybe for a few more years."

I would recommend reading Supercharged before Quarter Mile Hearts.  Supercharged made me love Max even more and it even made me want to reread Quarter Mile Hearts because I missed this world so much. There were times I was extremely frustrated with Max because he kept trying to fit in instead of just marching to the beat of his own drum.  Overall, I really loved this novella and I cannot wait tor Reckless Hearts."
0,"First, several day s prior to my stay, I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday. Saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday. I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night. The food was limp and uninspired. Further, I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. When I called in-room dining to request a spoon, I was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. When I explained I already had food and I didn't need a menu - I needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. Another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. They too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. Another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. Thanks - for charging me $100+ so that I could argue over cold, flavorless food. In addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, I found the room woefully lacking. It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell. Further, I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went."

0,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.  I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!  Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.  Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.  Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.  All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.  I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read."

1,"I was looking for something that would be easy to carry around in your pocket, but I just couldn't find it. The plastic parts are also very stiff and not easily adjustable. This is a very well made flashlight.  I was also very disappointed with the battery. The charger is not a very good quality, the battery compartment is very small and it is a little hard to get it to charge. The battery compartment is not strong enough to hold an 8 cell battery, so if you have a battery that is not strong enough, it will not last long. I am still looking for a replacement battery.  I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands. It is a great flashlight for those who want to carry around a flashlight.It is very good for this price.  It does not have the finish of the original."
0,"I received ""Whither Thou Goest, I will Go"" by Naomi Dathan for free from [...]  I picked this book for one reason:  some of it takes place in Kansas.  Since I am from Kansas, I usually read books with Kansas as the location since most authors do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about.  This is an incredibly good book.  I loved this.  It starts in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl.  Daddy calls all the shots in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son.  He bought their house, gives Jem an allowance, hires their help, everything.  When her father gets caught with his hands in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move.  Seth decides they are going to Kansas.  He actually winds up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line.  They move and start a new life.  One that Seth thinks he will control and start to call the shots.  God has other plans.  Jem is a wonderful fictional character.  She is soooo dramatic and funny.  She cracks me up even when she is being horrible.  Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman.  Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you.  The only thing I did not like was the format.  I hadn't read carefully enough to see that the format was for an i-pad.  I have a kindle.  I do have an android so I could read it that way and also online through [...]  The author sets up an account for you all you need to do is supply a password and read.  Still, would rather a mobi format. Love this!  5 Stars."

0,"I use this as bunny litter. I was using the Carefresh one for the longest time but I find this one to be cheaper so I've since switched to this one. As far as odor control this isn't the greatest, after all it is technically bedding, but I have found ways to help it capture the odor. All I do is simply pour the Arm & Hammer litter deodorizer baking soda onto the bottom of the litter box under this bedding and it works great to capture the odor.  I recommend to use this as bunny litter if your bunny/rabbit is litter box trained because that's what I do and it's been working out fantastically."

0,"An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention. This holster doesn't come close to it in quality or functionality."

0,"I am writing in regards to our stay April 22-24. We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay. There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay. My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival...it wasn't. When he called to place the order again, it never showed up. We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time. Our room was very small, drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for. We had called to request a room with a large tub, similar to the ones in the photos, prior to our arrival, noting that we didn't mind an upgrade cost. Instead, the tub was incredibly small. We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location, especially considering we were celebrating such a happy, once-in-a-lifetime occasion. The service and amenities just didn't match up."

1,"I had and constantly used this tool, and it worked flawlessly. The only downside is that it's very hard to get a good grip on the handle. The handle is straight, and it's not really stiff enough to hold a finger. This is a problem for most people. The only real flaw is that the grip is too loose. I've had this tool for a few years now and it's still strong. However, I would not recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a sturdy, secure, and comfortable hand grip. I'm glad I found this tool, because it was a pleasure to use. The company I work for should have started to make better tools. This is a great tool for getting things done at home. It's sturdy, holds a great angle, and is a good value. I don't recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a good quality tool. I really like the quality of this knife. It's sharp and very well made. I don't like the way the blade is curved, but it's a nice knife for my needs. The blade is made of metal, which means it's not sharpened like a regular blade. The knife is sharp enough to be used in a pinch, but that's okay because it's not meant for everyday use. The blade is sharp enough to be used for several projects, but I would not recommend it for a heavy project like this."

0,"So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.  When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.  At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)  I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.  I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.  Overall, I've been a little frustrated about a couple of things, but generally pleased with this purchase."
0,"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush."" Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons. ""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars. I highly recommend this movie if you are someone genuinely interested in understanding the motivations of a Meyer Lansky. He may not be an American hero, but Lansky cannot be ignored if you truly desire to comprehend the difficulties of many to assimilate into our national culture."

0,"I'm going to review this movie for 1 reason only, and it's for the HDR (4k release) content. My opinion on the movie itself is too subjective, and some people just hate Zach Snyder so they won't watch this movie anyways. Anyhow, let's talk about the HDR, and you're buying this for the upgraded visuals. Let me tell you something, the last half of the movie is SIMPLY STUNNING and if you have a newer 4k television with the ability to handle HDR correctly, you'll be in for a visual treat. This is the movie you show to people that have not seen 4k and HDR before, because the colors and contrast pops so much it's stunning. You're literally going to be amazed how bright some objects in the scenes look. Zach Snyder is known for loving his darker scenes, and this movie is very dark in tone and in plot, but then he amazes us with a visual treat when the action  picks up and that dark mood is met with explosions, bright glowing kryptonite, and heat vision eye blasts. If there was a way to capture the image to prove this to you, I would do so and upload it. For now, you need the right type of UHD HDTV that is calibrated and can handle HDR content, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The movies for 4k with HDR are lacking right now, and you want to show off? Pick up this title, because even if you aren't a fan of the plot, you WILL be a fan of showing this off to others."

0,"They rave about their beds but the beds were average. On surface room seemed clean, however, dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust. It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall. The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole. Impossible to have a decent shower or bath. EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water. I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor. Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death. There was even a $10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room, really! For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity. Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity. I have already been charged for him to deliver the food. The parking fees were outrageous at $51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public. Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing. I reported the theft to the hotel. Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days. It has now been over two weeks. No follow up, no apology even given. We will never stay at this hotel again. We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at."

This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.  In McQuarrie's defence, I did get the feeling that many of the needless plot devices were meant to set up that final line of dialogue.  But even if that's the case, it's still not worth it because it wasn't THAT funny."

This is a great belt for the money.  I have a few other belts I'd recommend to anyone who needs a belt that will last a long time.  I do think that the compression may be a little more comfortable for some people, but I don't think so.

I've had 3 knee surgeries and have fractured my ankle on my dominant (right) side. My dad is a pastor and a physical therapist healing hands I guess is why he toon that route. Anyway so I always got in homehelp but my body has gotten stiff over the years with cartledge and joint discomfort. We are talking complete subluxation (dislocation) of my knee caps from the sockets. So when I say I feel it in my quads, my hams, and my knees you better believe it. I don't know how well it's gonna play out but we will see. I'm 300 pounds 6'3 and I ain't obese theres a tone of muscle  on me due to I got into weight lifting. Yes I know it's not great on my knees to add weight but I'm trying to build my legs as well. So far Tai cheng has proven to be the hardest leg workout I've done thus far. I also enjoy it he talks to you not at you which is hard considering he's on TV not in person. My dad has seen the visa and if you're wondering if Dr. Cheng knows his stuff take in consideration NY dad a physical therapist for 20+ years said it's simple but effective since it's trying to make your body work naturally."

Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.

I would recommend it to anyone who loves mystery.I enjoyed this book.  I have read it twice now, and I have enjoyed it as well.  I was actually not sure if this book was written by a real author or if it was written by a fiction writer.  I was very disappointed.  I was given the opportunity to read this book only because I read it twice and I was really disappointed.  It is very boring, with no real plot.  It is not really a story.  I was just bored.  It was like watching a movie that was not very interesting and there was no real plot.  The main characters are boring, so you would think they would have been more interesting.  The main characters are not very interesting and I was not really interested in the plot.  I was not sure if this was meant to be a story or not.  It was really boring.  I just didn't like it.

0,"Ahh...such a pretty cover that contains a book that is really nothing special.  But, I've read the Vampire Kisses series by Schrieber, so I was kind of expecting it.  I actually liked Celeste and I liked Brandon.  Celeste is different than the typical teenager in her crowd.  It stands out right from the beginning.  She goes with the flow because it's the easy thing to do.  She didn't want to loose her friends by rocking the boat.  I wasn't surprised by it.  I also liked how Brandon is different.  He doesn't fit it with either crowd.  It's especially interesting when we learn about his life at his previous school.  I also like the chemistry between Celeste and Brandon, that is until it got a little over the top.  It's like an inevitable part of teen fiction sometimes.  I wasn't particularly found of Celeste's friends.  They seemed so shallow.  And Nash was just not likable at all.  I was expecting a love triangle type of things.  But, Nash was hard for me to swallow.  I also didn't really like the town divided thing.  It just didn't work with the story in my eyes.  The actual legend of the werewolf was different.  It was really tame compared to other stories.  But, then again it fits into the author's idea of vampires in her other series.  So, will I read the next one?  I'm not sure.  This was ok, but it didn't really stand out in any way.  But, the author's other series did get progressively better with each book, so I might give the next installment a go."
1,This is a short novella that takes you on a journey of discovery and discovery. I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review. The author is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading more of her work. I enjoyed this story. I liked the characters and the storyline. I found myself with a feeling of danger in the end. It was a fun read. I liked the ending. I liked the fact that the two main characters were a good couple. I liked the fact that the author gave the reader a good story line. This was a great book. It was fast paced and well written. The characters were well developed. It was a fun read. I have read this author before and she is not my favorite. I found it a bit hard to believe that she would write this book for me. I will be reading the next one. I have not read the previous book and it is not my favorite. I am not sure if this author has had a chance to do a better job of writing this book. I will have to wait for the next one. I was very disappointed in this book. It was not a great book but it was a great book. I would recommend this book to everyone. I have enjoyed reading the series and this one had me wanting more.

Because I didn't follow the Bee Gees as closely as I did the Beatles, I didn't really know that much about their history or much of their music.

1,"Cowell delivers a narrative of what happens when the U.S. becomes involved in the war and the role that the West played in it.  The reader is introduced to a strong and determined young man who is not in the military, but is an American soldier who has served in the field and a woman who is a native of Afghanistan.  The story is told from the point of view of a young soldier who has spent his entire life on the battlefield and has seen much of the horror and devastation of war.  The book is well written and provides insight into the role of the West in the war.  Powell's book is a good read and I recommend it.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not a riveting story.  I will be re-reading the book several times.This is a book about a teen in the 60's.  When he was 16 he went to a local library to read books by other people.  He went and bought this book.

This is where the adventure begins. Too many spoilers would be revealed if I expounded further. Let me just say that you will be surprised with each turn of the page! Book 1 could and can stand on its own, but again,. I want to read more about the characters I met in this book! Book 2 in the series, kept me on my toes and up at night as I tried to figure out who done/or was doing it! The mystery was profound up until the last chapter! Hickory Dickory Dock is the third in the series! I really enjoyed the story. It can stand alone but reading the first two will add to the enjoyment and mystery! Marlow and Sage have a connection; and not in the way that you would think! The mystery is woven through out the whole book! Who done it or who is doing it! Marlow and Sage must solve the mystery to survive! I think this book will appeal to all audiences, young and old(well, anyone that enjoys a little sci-fi and mystery). Great job Ms."

Even if you are a super sized person, like me with a height of 6'4', there are special 'Tall Rooms' just for you. My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. Before I go to a meeting, I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service.

I set this unit up right under the a/c coil drain pan, 3/4"" PVC pipe into pump container and routed the 3/8"" tube into mop sink. Plugged it in, poured water in from a cup to test. It fired right up and continued to work perfect. It's very quite and it comes with the check valve so water in the tube vertical doesn't drain back into the resivoir. Very happy with it!"
0,"Another great book of Katie and Tyler's love story. They are finally back together again and living together in California. Trouble finished their European tour and Katie and Tyler talked all the time and skyped every night. Now that they are back together again and more in love, things are going to take work and nothing worth anything will be easy. More secrets are revealed and they both have to live with mistakes they made and things that happened.  Katie hasn't always been Ms. Responsible or Ms. Perfect. She's lived her life and made some mistakes but she's never done anything intentionally to hurt anyone. She has a good heart and she cares about the people in her life. Her love for Tyler is all encompassing and she just wants to make him happy.  Tyler has a really screwed up past and he's had problems for years of trying to get past it all. He's done so many drugs and almost died on many occasions. But his love for Katie makes him want to be clean and have a life with her. He's trying to find a way to work where his problems with his hands don't interfere.  Definitely worth reading and looking forward to more of their story that comes out in January."

1,So nice to have an easy set up.  I've also used this for a few hours.
0,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protector. Guess I use the sheets to substitute for that.
0,"Nice shoulders, but the pants bars do not have any grippy coating as advertised.  The pants fall off pretty easily.  I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.

I will watch it again and again!I love this movie! I will watch it again and again!I really enjoyed this movie. I like that the main character is not the bad guy, but the good guy.

0,"To begin with, my grandsons, ages 4 and 6, had already been watching the show and really liked it, so they were more than delighted to get their own Chuggington to play with. The thing I like about this toy is its sturdiness.  If it's one thing I've learned about little boys it's that they are rough on toys, yet they get upset if something breaks.  I sympathize with the person who said the cars fall off the tracks, but my experience has been that unless you pay a lot of money and buy replicas of real trains and anchor the tracks down permanently somewhere, you will have that problem with any toy that runs on tracks.  Also, the set is chunky enough and easy enough to set up to not frustrate small children whose fine motor skills are not that well developed.  Therefore, the toy helps give children confidence that they can do something themselves.  And I think that any toy that lets children use their own imagination when they play is very good.  There are far too many toys out there that don't do that.  Everything is already imagined for the child.  Not only are these toys not helping children, they are downright boring to play with.  I don't believe that most people realize how important it is for children to develop their imaginations.  This is not something frivilous.  It is those who can imaginine new technology, new inventions, and new and better ways of living that bring progress to the world."

0,"My doc has been after me to use Hibiclens for a chronic skin problem I've been suffering with.. Problem was I couldn't afford it.  So being a rather resourceful person, I figured it out.  If a Vet. grade product that is used on animals is safe, and it is the same basic chemical as Hibiclens (without all the dyes and perfumes) then what the heck do I have to worry about?  So I tried it, and it worked. But the real test came when I went back to my doc and told her that although I could not afford Hibiclens, I got a Vet. Grade product of chlorhexidine and used it.  Her response? She smiled and gave me a thumbs up!  In other words folks, if this stuff is safe for Fluffy it's safe for you too.  That is, as safe as any chemical might be.  Use your head, read, dilute the stuff (one ounce per gallon). Don't get it in your ears and eyes and please first mention it to your doc that you intend on doing this. They are the professionals, and if it's not good for you they will say so.  Always check with your doc. And I don't mean Dr. Google."

0,"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed. The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. Finally, my 72 year old mother, 8 year old son, and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. As far as I could tell, he was just standing there doing nothing. I couldn't let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt. The attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. They should have been ashamed. Less significant, but irritating issues. The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club. Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. Basically, two adults can take up 2/3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1/3rd. This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. In addition, the pool closes at 9 p.m. What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights. Not one single additional bar of soap, bottle of shampoo, or coffee stirrers."

Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype. 'Recently renovated' apparently means it was redone in the last decade, not the last year. It was just very tired-looking. Also very disappointing was the food, and the service was hit or miss. I expected better from a hotel of this caliber. Bottom line, there are better places with better value. Stay elsewhere."

1,I can't say I've ever had an electrician who didn't need a charge for the first couple of months. I had a friend who was a lifetime electrician who had a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers. I was very excited about the idea of using the lithium ion battery and a 2 AAA battery to charge the batteries. I have a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers and had to install a lot of batteries on my electrician's old electrician's motor. I wanted to be able to charge the batteries in the same way that I was able to use a battery powered electrician. So I used the Lutron Lithium Ion Battery. I was very impressed with this battery. I also had no issues with the batteries. I like the fact that I can charge the batteries in the same way as the battery powered electrician. I also like the fact that the battery is not a single AA battery. It is a single
0,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

0,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum. Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too. Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.  I hope you find this review helpful and think if you just give Cat's Pride Fresh and Light a try you will never buy any other brand again!"

My wife and I have used them many times and we always use them. We have tried them on our mamma bike, and we always love them. They seem to be very durable and last much longer than any other brand we have tried. The material is very durable and the colors are very vibrant. It is really easy to adjust and change colors. I also think that the padding is a little snug for my wife and her wrist, but that is because she is in the wheelchair.

There is little to no fear that it will fray into your hands, the way some cheap manila ropes will. The 1.5"" diameter is perfect for my children to grip, and is also good for adults. The rubberized coating on the end should last a while if we keep it from dragging all over the ground.  Compared to synthetic/poly climbing ropes bought by some friends (on Amazon), it is much easier to hold and grip. It's not slippery like they are. I think this one is much safer for the little hands.  At the end of the day, it's a rope you toss over a tree limb to climb and swing. But it's more quality than I expected for the price."

If I can install it successfully, ANYONE can.  I had more trouble getting my crusty 15-year old lock off than I did installing this one.  There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds."

They think it will just complicate a already complicated situation with Natasha & Felix, but their chemistry is too strong and situations too intense to break the bond they have. Instead it turns it from friends to lovers. The desire for each other becomes too much and they change their relationship! I absolutely love these two as a couple.

1,"Eyes On You by Kate Rosalsky  When I saw her book, I was just blown away by how beautiful and loving Kate is. The way she presents the story, and the characters, is so touching.  I loved the way she brought me to tears in the first book. I loved how she held me in place and how she touched my heart so deeply. I loved how she had me thinking about the situations that she created. I loved how she had me thinking about her past, about how she was trying to figure out who she was, and how she felt about being with her family. I loved how she showed me how she could not wait to see how things would turn out and to see what would happen next. I loved how she made me feel as though I was being held in the right place at the right time. I loved how she had me on the edge of my seat and the way she had me looking at her. I loved how she made me feel like I was in love with her. I loved how she had me thinking about what I should do next.  I loved the way she was able to turn the pages so fast.

1,Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar. The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room. I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. I didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. If my stay wasn't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated. The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online. I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.

I didn't buy these to run any races with, I got them to do hooligan stuff on my 29er MTB that I have essentially converted to a street ride. Pump these up to 60PSI, enjoy a huge reduction of rolling resistance, plenty of traction on hard surfaces, plenty of pressure to land however you want and not worry about a flat, but just enough tread pattern to get you by on dirt and grass for areas you are transitioning to and from."

He really likes the bell on the end and he's drawn to the colorful spheres. The reason I took a star off is that the area where the hook connects to the top sphere is very loose. The whole toy pops off of the hook frequently with very little pulling, sometimes they fall off just trying to hang it in the cage. In the end the bird still plays with it and he enjoys it, so it's not a super big deal. Overall, a fun toy for my cockatiel, even if it doesn't stay connected to the hook."
1,"This has all the Alien features of the first movie. I saw it on a VHS and was a little disappointed. The movie itself is good but the acting is not great. The movie takes place in the future where the Alien is sent to Earth. This is a far cry from the first movie. The movie is the most realistic movie I have seen on the Alien franchise. I will say that the acting is not bad. The movie is very realistic and a good way to show that the Alien is real. The alien is a very scary creature that is not scary at all. There is a scene where the Alien is said to be a ""little kid"". The movie is filled with references to other movies and to a horror movie. It is a scary movie to see how it is made. I wish there were more movies like this on the DVD. I will say that the movies are not bad. I recommend that you buy the movie. I recommend that you watch this movie. This is a great movie and worth watching."

0,"I purchased 2 bras....this one and the Bali Women's Smooth U Front Close Bra.  I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.  I don't know if a 38C or a 36D would have been the right choice with this bra, it definitely felt too small, but the 36C with the Bali was perfect."

It's not a large beam, but it is very bright.  The light is enough to cover the entire length of my face.  I have had several people complain about the size of the light, but I have never seen anything that big.  It's very bright.  I have had no problems with the light.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  You can't beat the price for this product.  I've used it for over a year, and I still have no problems with it.  It's bright and bright."

0,"So-so.  That's how'd I'd describe this romance collection.  As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.  The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.  If you are interested in historical accuracy and developed characters, skip this one.  If you want a story to entertain you on a rainy afternoon, it will do the trick just fine."

I used them to hold metric and SAE open end, open end ring (combination) and ring spanners and found they tidied up my tool box leaving much more room and making the tools identifiable at a glance. You can cut them to fit and I found a small band saw did the best job but a sharp blade would work as well. I highly recommend these."

I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. The decor is a lot of fun. We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. The front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier. For people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away.

0,"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot. I'm sorry but if a waring blender can't make a semi-frozen smoothie, what can it do? Puree soups?"

Seen it before? Yep! Clooney (Danny Ocean), yet in another ex-convict role (remember ""O, Brother...""?), leads a gang of eleven experts to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Sounds like a familiar plot? Perhaps, but Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull off a movie that's very entertaining. Not that it's in any way related to the plot of the 1992 movie, but it reminded me of the movie ""Sneakers"" where Robert Redford gathered a group of experts as well... That's where the similarities stop. Then it is very much like Traffic, in its overall feel, music, and even part of the concept. 'Nuf said! Check it out! It's one of the most entertaining movies of the Christmas season."

0,"It took me 2 attempts (months apart) to make it through this book.  I don't enjoy adventure stories all that much. I need my brain to be stimulated by conniving plot twists or revealing secrets or a romance. Adventure stories don't provide that for me. They move at a slower pace that just builds and builds but never seems to go anywhere. And that is the problem here.  This story is pretty much documenting Leah's journey West once she discovers the truth about her uncle. I wanted gun fights and showdowns, not the dark reality of a pilgrimage West.  That being said, the realism is one of the highlights of the novel for me. What I really enjoyed about this book was that it was very realistic. The pilgrimage to the West was a gruesome and often deadly journey for those who decided to try it. Whether it was for gold or a new life of freedom, some people and families found it to be worth the risk and I think that is all beautifully represented here. Carson has done her research about what was in store for these people and it shows throughout her writing. For world-builder fans, you will be more than satisfied with this."
0,"We had this gun for more than a month now. We purchased NERF guns in the past and the automatic feature sounds very appealing and fun. Right out of the box (after inserting new C-batteries which were purchased separately), the first time the new darts were placed in the transparent clip, one of the darts clogged the gun. There are times when my son can shoot the entire contents of the clip (18 elite darts - we ended up buying additional elite darts from Amazon - I believe this is a good deal:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Dart-Refill-Pack-30-Darts/dp/B0083TXZVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nerf N-Strike Elite Dart Refill Pack (30 Darts)</a>), and other times when the gun gets clogged. It became a habit to watch my son excited to use this gun, only to have it get clogged, and get him upset. I would say the major fault with this gun is clogging: about 30-40% of the time. That's way too much, and I believe the reason for it is the design of the flexible darts. In addition, I would say the use of C batteries may not be the most inspired option. You have to unscrew the battery holder, and I believe that the batteries can drain unnecessary fast, since there is no shut-off button. Otherwise I do not know how to explain why we had to replace batteries 2 weeks after relatively limited playtime.  I was undecided to give this product 3 or 4 stars. I settled on 4 since the gun itself is great fun when it works. I find the issue to be with the flexibility of the darts. Once they get bent, the chances for clogging increases, and even new darts can get stuck and stop the fun."
1,"decent basic walleye rig.  Not an easy task to put together, but for the price, it's a great buy.  I am a 32 oz female and wear a 34 in this bag.  I am not in the water, so I have not had to worry about getting wet.  I am not a fan of the orange color, but the orange is a nice color.  I am quite pleased with the quality of this bag.  I have a size 32 and am very happy with the size.  I would definitely recommend this bag to any woman who needs a nice big bag to keep her hands warm or dry.  UPDATE:  I received a second pair of these bags on December 8, 2017.  I received these bags within a week of receiving them and they are now my favorite.  I highly recommend this bag for anyone who is in need of a small bag to keep their hands warm or dry."

0,"The first delivery arrived with spider web cracks running through it.  The screen protector is glass, and while it is adequately packaged for normal shipping, I suspect that the corner of a box on the delivery truck caught it.  The return process was very quick and easy.  Once I received the replacement, installation was simpler than many plastic protectors I've worked with on other devices.

After that I tried to make them in a pan with vinegar, used microwave poachers, etc.. and finally just gave up. I was shopping for something else on Amazon and just happened to run into this pan advertised.  It seemed like a lot of $$ to poach eggs.  I read the reviews and ordered it. Life is good!!  Haha. I now have my perfect 4 min. poached eggs again. Put a little water or butter in the cups and the eggs slide right out.  The pan is very useful for me.  I reheat food in it, make sauces, cook small quantities of anything.  Washes up easily! Cups wash right up. I would definitely buy this again and what a fool for waiting sooooooo long to enjoy eggs the way I want them again!"

0,"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash."

1,I've had this for a few weeks and the dogs love it. I have a large dog and she loves it. I am using it for the first time since it was used for a couple weeks and she still plays with it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a large dog. My dog is a 9 pound Maltese mix and it is a little rough on his back legs but he has not had any problems with it. He is a good chewer and he gets his treats from my other dogs so I will buy this again. I will definitely be ordering this again. Highly recommend this product. UPDATE:  I received a second one from Amazon and it arrived at the correct price. It is a bit big for my dog's size and the 3 inch inside diameter is pretty much what I was looking for. I ordered the smaller one because it is a little small but I will order the larger one for my other dogs as they are small and there is no way they can fit inside. My dogs are so small that I have to have them on both sides of the house and the size fits perfectly and I can't be sure it will fit. I was worried it might hurt my dogs because they are so small but it is a great size for them. It is well made and it is very comfortable for them. They are very happy with it and I will be ordering more!Great Product. My dog loves this toy.

I even played it a lot with one daughter when she had to be under a mist tent in the hospital.  It's the only thing that wouldn't fall apart!  Those memories flooded back when one of these big versions was in the waiting room at Texas Children's Hospital.  My grandson had a ball with it while waiting to have his tonsils out.  HE wasn't interested in playing by the rules (he's 3), but he liked putting the discs in and then getting them to drop out.  When he got tired of doing that, he turned the discs into pretend food to use with the kitchen set.  The downside to this is I have had to pick up all of the discs many times as the 3 year olds (he has a twin brother) scatter them every where.  Oh well, that's what kids do.  We are working on getting them to help pick them up.  At least there is a convenient way to store them."

0,"I stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference. My fiance' accompanied me. When we checked in, we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed. So instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined, we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house! We discovered that the coffee maker wasn't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it, and waited two and half hours. We had issues with the plumbing, including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill. The toilet stopped working twice. We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room, sitting on the bed, watching the tv and talking on her cell phone. They bellman were rude, and wouldn't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment. There were errors on our bill. Last but not least, we saw a ROACH in the drawers. Alive.

We had booked an Executive Guest room, upon arrival we were informed that they would be upgrading us to a beautiful Junior Suite. This was just a wonderful unexpected plus to our beautifully planned weekend. The front desk manager was professional and made us feel warmly welcomed. The Chicago Affinia was just a gorgeous hotel, friendly staff, lovely food and great atmosphere. Not the mention the feather pillows and bedding that was just fantastic. Also we were allowed to bring out beloved Shi-Tzu and he experienced the Jet Set Pets stay. The grooming was perfect, the daycare service we felt completely comfortable with.

I like that the spring is spring loaded and that the sink is made of silicone.  I love that it has a built in vent valve and that it can be removed with a push of a button.  I also like that the spring is spring loaded and that the sink is made of silicone.  I also like that the spring is flush with the sink so that the sink can be used with either a spring loaded or a spring loaded sink.  I have not tried the spring loaded sink yet but I would recommend this sink.  I'll update this review if I have any problems.works great and it's so easy to use. I have used it on a number of different projects and it does a great job.This is a very nice tool.  I was looking for a tool that could fit my old saw and it's a great tool.

0,"Very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. I've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. Also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout!"

BUT...what's cool about this cube also happens to make it a nightmare to solve. In direct light, colors are difficult to spot. Very difficult. And as for mechanics, it's terrible compared to so many other brands. This is niche market--if you're like me, and became obsessed with cubes, and want to own one that's truly aesthetically pleasing, yeah, but it. But that's the only reason to."

I'm a big fan of them both. Well worth watching."

0,"In this movie George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, who has just been released from jail.  He has two goals--to rob three Las Vegas casinos and to win back his ex-wife (played by Julia Roberts) who is dating the owner of the casinos.  He assembles 11 men to help him and they are played by such crowd-pleasers as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, and Elliott Gould.  The movie is fun, slick and full of high-tech and low-tech gimmicks which help Ocean's 11 gain access to the casinos.  My biggest complaint is that Julia Roberts is miscast and underutilized as the trophy wife/girlfriend of the two adversaries.  However, if you can put that aside, Ocean's 11 offers an enjoyable evening of entertainment."
0,I love these dot markers! My 3 year old daughter likes to dot and drag rather than simply dot. Other brands of dot markers were easily ruined and now leak heavily when used. I'm not worried about these because the tip appears to be cloth rather than foam. The colors are also very vibrant and you get 8 markers rather than the usual 6 pack offered by other brands. Very happy with this purchase!

1,A refreshing read.  At first I thought the writing was good but as the story progressed I realized the author had not had a grasp of how to develop the characters.  The writing was very difficult to follow and the dialogue was quite a bit choppy.  The story was short and the story was fast paced but I found it difficult to keep reading the story.

0,"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!  I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue."

In frustration, I came back to the cassette adapter concept. Thanks to a previous reviewer who mentioned that this adapter works with GM factory cassette decks and others won't. I purchased this adapter and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-9749-PJBLK-PowerJolt-Auto-Charger-for-iPod-Black/dp/B000FIQC5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger for iPod (Black)</a>&nbsp;and it's a near-perfect solution for me. There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.  Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...  Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.  Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter. I purchased an inexpensive FM transmitter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPod-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit/dp/B002US9SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPod FM Transmitter Car Kit</a>) and it works great so far, with a lot less frustration."

We like State Street better than Michigan Avenue and the Palmer House is right there. We stayed in the Towers, in a room with two double beds and 2 baths. The room was not huge, but very comfortable. The towers area was recently refurbished and it shows, the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen TVs on the walls, comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food/drinks. There is a continental breakfast in the morning, appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes. There is a fridge stocked with soft drinks, water and juice that are yours for the taking. We were very pleased with the upgraded Towers, everyone should check it out!"

If you watch behind the scenes video, you'll see how the movie company's research found that Maui's hair was very important to the Demi God, so why make the hair fake?  Anyway, my kid loves this set and it is very cute.  Any little Moana Princess or lover will really enjoy this set."

0,"There are some things I like about this product and some I do not.  As with most tools models, brands, quality, what the tool is being used, cost and other things make a buying decision.  This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.  Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.  But then I prefer top of the line tools, they usually pay you back in useability, durability and quality of work.  But then this drill may be ok for you.  I really cannot say I had problems with the battery kicking out, but then that is me.  I put this tool somewhere in the middle for quality and cost.  Time will tell on the durability.  So I give it 3 stars."

I actually read the French translation First I haven't read many Swedish authors so it was very entertaining to have that perspective instead something centered in the US Second, the title in French is more descriptive ""men who hate women"". Very strong; a male friend of mine asked ""is that possible?"" and after reading the book you see why they chose such a strong title. I felt that that the author really thought about the stereotypes that people have against women and he came across was very sensitive. Third, well the book was just well researched and interesting."

Overall, I could not be happier.  It all works so well and so far without a glitch.  I don't know what else to add.  It works and its easy to set up.  I just ordered six more switches.  Its kinda fun to spook people at my home when I am travelling!"

0,"At its best, this book is an amusing memoir about working as a presidential speechwriter, and a patriotic assessment of what government can do to help people. It doesn't always maintain that level though. List tells his story in roughly chronological order, but there isn't anything like a traditional dramatic arc here -- we get discussion of a good political thing, then a speech about infrastructure, a speech about correctional policy, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a bad political thing, a speech about health care, another White House Correspondents' Dinner, etc. Books by political insiders can be fascinating but Litt was not really an insider. Stories are fueled by proximity to power and to important decisions, but Litt never really got that. He shares with us some funny jokes, and these are the best part of the book. A collection of his favorite Obama humor might have worked better than the book we actually got.  Yes, we get the story of how Litt got his job in the White House, buffered by his assurance to the reader that he didn't really deserve the job and repeated apologies for being white (starting on page 40 when he gets an internship with West Wing Writers). Litt does have some nice turns of phrase in the book; I particularly liked his judgment that the president doesn't play chess, he plays whack-a-mole. Many famous people appear in cameos, including an unpleasant run-in with Harvey Weinstein that's a lot more interesting to read now than it would have been a month ago. The Republican party's weird love affair with Vladimir Putin starting in 2014 gets called out as well; I suspect we'll hear more about that over time.  The book is at its darkest when discussing early problems with the Affordable Care Act website. Was that really so terrible? I remember that it didn't work well, but I would have thought that the Democrats' midterm losses would have been worse, from the point of view of the White House."
0,You won't be disappointed in this figurine.  It's an exceptionally good quality and the features are really done well.  It's a great gift to a young teen.  My grandson age 13 really couldn't wait to get this.  He was on top of the world when it arrived.  He couldn't thank me enough.  Shows it off on his shelve proudly.  It's always good when the kids are not disappointed when they open a gift.  A little pricey but honestly for the quality it was worth it.

0,"I Will Breathe Forbidden Series, Book 1  Regina Puckett  Reviewed by Roy Murry, Author  This Young Adult read is for the young at heart like them and me. It is fun, bizarre, and delightful. Some of the reasons I keep coming back to Regina's short novels  In this adventure, Liberty, a young lady pilot of an airship, goes about her business of bartering items needed in her post end of times world.  On one of her stops to deliver goods, she takes on the task of caring for a robot who has feelings. On a stop to get water fuel for her ship, she encounters other humans.  The adventure begins, and Liberty breaks all of her dead father's rules by engaging the robot and the humans. She finds love, a trait she has been avoiding all her life.  How this all comes about and how Liberty changes are the lessons learned in this novel; some that YA's should learn.  An enjoyable quick read. The way I like it."
1,"This laundry center has streamlined and has kept the tools comfortable for a long time. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The basic design is nice and it is easy to set up and use. The carpet is very soft and the materials are excellent. The colors are great. The colors are also great. I love the fact that it is a solid color. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it. I like that the colors are longer than the standard ones. I'm going to order another set of these for my bathroom. I'm very pleased with this purchase.A must have for every day use.  I have to get on the couch and sit on the couch, but my son can sit on the couch too.  I have a dog and my husband can sit on the couch too.  These are great for sitting on and on the couch.  I have a dog who doesn't like to stand on the couch but he loves them and they are good for him too.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good quality vacuum, and these are a great value for the money.I bought this for my daughter to use with her headboard.  It was easy to install and did not require the use of a plastic cap.  The blade is a little long but it works great.  The brush works well and is a bit easier to use.

1,"Well designed blade paired with a 9mm Remington. I will keep this blade in my collection. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his gun very well. The straps are very tight and it will hang out over the gun with no issues. I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight. I will order a pair again, and they will fit him well. I love this mat. I have been using it for several months now and it is very comfortable."

I loved it. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. I'm on my way to reading the next book. I read this book in one sitting, and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to read this story.

1,"The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property, given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast. Unfortunately, I saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. While the lobby was gorgeous (and appears to match the photos on the website) the room I was assigned was run down, and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. It looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls, but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. The room also smelled of must or mildew. While the room did have air-conditioning as advertised, it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. I was only here for a single night, but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund. Please, if you're staying in this part of town, do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. The Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby, clean, and often have special-offers -- these aren't the only properties in the area, but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay."
1,"so i buy a lot of these and i feel like i will be happy with the result.Great product. Great price. I am using it in the shop to cover a lot of metal. It is great for cutting up your projects.I have had these for a few months now and they have been great so far.  I have had them for a few months now and they are very comfortable and will hold up to the elements for a long time.  They are not very strong and have a tendency to flex the little bit too much, which is why I put them in a shop.  I am happy with them so far.They work great. We bought a couple of of these for our garage to replace the old one. They are great. Very bright. I have been using them all day and the only drawback is the metal screws are a little too long for my small hand.Works as advertised.This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material. The other pair of these are a little smaller, but it is still very well made.  The ""One-Tenth of the Price"" rating is very nice for having a limited amount of light, but if you are looking for a quality item, I would recommend these.  You will need to purchase the light from the seller, and then you will be ready to install it.  I do not recommend buying the light from the seller, but I do recommend this light for the price.  I recommend this light for my EDC"

0,"I never read a comic book and when I saw the first X-Men film, I was intrigued, but confused. Throughout the trilogy, I always thought I was missing a lot of the story and this is it. First Class is the missing link that will answer questions for the fans of the movie, who don't follow the comics, and it is one blockbuster film that more than lives up to its hype. From the special effects to the make-up and finally to the actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, & Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was terrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly out of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more. I can't wait to see what connections the next forty years bring between first class and the trilogy. When it's all said and done, I hope I can watch all these films and truly understand the whole story."

0,"I download a lot of books but rarely read them all the way through.  This was different -- I enjoyed learning more about the gaming world, there was romance and a good plot, and enough sex for those who want it.  It was very much Fifty Shades of Grey in the gaming world, and parts were a little like Pretty Woman, but both with a more independent and intelligent heroine.  The only distractions were that the entire book needs an editor to proofread it, and maybe a little too much detail about what the main characters were wearing.  Oh, and the techie terms and name pronunciations should have been up front or referenced at the beginning.  Looking forward to reading more from this author!"

It's very delicate, and it's very light weight. The color is very vibrant, and it looks quite nice on.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and it's a great product. It's a very good quality product, and I'm happy to say that I'll be ordering more of these again in the future.I love these shoes.

0,"A truely enjoyable read. A fine young hero with a strange, but strong moral code, amusingly turned from a remorseless cold blooded killer to a hero with a few misheard garbled dying words. I love his emotionly stunted emergance into the real world and the wide eyed innocence of his first encounter with ""friends"". I intend to follow the series and sincerely hope the author continues in the same playful, yet deadly, vein."

0,"I would be tempted to give this a 3 1/2 if Amazon allowed that option. The short version is that I can see this for the lower age child if she has an interest in robots or computers. But kids want more from their electronic toys.  Middle aged adults who don't care about electronic toys shouldn't receive this as a gift.  (Not referring to myself by the way, I love electronic toys)  I've bought severeal WowWee products over the years including the Robosapien and the Roboraptor.  This is the first one that I had to download an app to fully appreciate-- It says in the product information that it works without the app but given the limitations I'm not sure that I would buy this without access to either an ipad or a smart phone.  My ipad is a bit outdated and the app would not download to it, so I downloaded it to my Samsung III phone which worked ok. I think this is the oldest Samsung that it would work with by the way.  Like all of the WowWee products I have bought it does not come with a battery so I had to supply them.  It also has a compartment for the batteries that requires a tiny screw driver. I don't know if they plan to upgrade the app but it doesn't do a lot of different things-- makes noises, the face on the screen changes, and it can run through a simple routine of turns and straight movements.  A ten year old lost interest in it pretty quick but a 7 year old was more intrigued.  The most damning statement came from a 53 year old who said it was like a Furbee but more annoying."
0,"Got a great deal through Hotwire for $70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again, even at full price. We really liked the rooms muted modern decor, we had John Lennon and Bono for company. Comfortable bed, mini coffe maker, plenty storage space and a lovely, clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products (so I was sold straight away...it doesn't take much, I know!). If you're a product junkie, tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies :) We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave, found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed (reception, gift shop and bar). The bar area is very trendy, I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking...the lack of memorabilia didn't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway. The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh, and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a 'friendly lady looking for business' when he was at the bar. I think it's a place you will either love or hate, if you like laid back, contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you!"

0,"This is a great! little stove. It is very small, but it does what it is supposed to do. Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.  I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.  If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.  Usually bring water to a boil in about 7 minutes."

0,"I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro. However, our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another. The bathroom was small but well appointed. Overall, it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe. The area is also very close to public transportation (we used the trains exclusively) and got around quite well without a car. We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others."

I can't believe it but, 6 months later, she still loves it and plays with it as much as when it was new. Everyone gets a daily cone. Visitors must order what they want. And she still plays with it on her own.  Plus, we all pay with the cash. She tells us how much we owe - $1 for each scoop plus $1 for a topping. She figures the cost on her own and knows when she's been given the correct amount.  This gift turned out to be a way better purchase than I ever expected it to be."

0,"The Iliad is perhaps the first of the action books. I read this translation because I found it to be very enjoyable and flows well.  This of course is the story of Achilles, Helen, Agamemmnon, Odysseus, Hector and Paris. We have love, war, adultery, courage, family relationships, loyalty and morality all brought to the battlefield.  Most everyone has read the story (or at least seen the horrible movie staring Brad Pitt). This epic is truly epic and will not easily be forgotten. I found myself siding with both camps and my morality questioned by the story's nagging questions of what is worth fighting and dying for.  A book that is both timeless and a classic. You have not lived until you have read the Iliad."
1,For me book 3 was more of a cliffhanger. The story was a bit different. There was a lot of angst. There was a lot of sex. There was a lot of hurt and pain. I liked it. I liked how it was written. I liked how it was a quick read. I liked the fact that it was a short story. I liked how it had a lot of depth and the fact that it was a well written story. I liked the fact that the author included a lot of action and action scenes. I liked how it was told and the fact that it was a short story.

The staff was great and always greeted us as we walked in and out of the hotel. They even remembered our names! The location of the hotel was amazing, right on the Magnificent Mile. We really enjoyed our stay and the kids loved the indoor pool. I would definitely stay there again if I have the chance and would recommend it to anyone I know going to the Chicago area."
0,"This was a really enjoyable book. It sucked me in from the very beginning. I cared about the characters right away and wanted to know what was happening to them. The heartache and sorrow the characters felt. I know there are men out there who are very controlling of their girlfriend and spouse and this book shows a little bit of how one can be manipulated and cut off from their family. It is a pretty quick read because you will not want to put it down. I recommend this book and really enjoyed reading it. When it was done I wanted to know more about the characters. All the women in the book are strong women but they don't see it, the reader does."

0,"I bought the 20-piece set as a trial, along with some Wallace flatware that cost a bit more. I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more. The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.  I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own. But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware."
0,"Fast Diet is the best weight loss book I have read in a very long time. It has a practical approach and it is not full of unrealistic goals that are impossible to keep, like most of the diet books out there. I have been searching for the diet to work for me and after a lot of books with unrealistic methods and goals, I have finally found one that I believe will work for me. I showed my mom this book and this is the same weight loss approach that she has been using and she has been losing weight very steadily. I'm so excited to start. With no major holidays coming up, I'm going to start immediately. Another thing I really liked about the book is how the author tells more about herself and her life than just the diet period. It makes it so much easier to relate to. The cute pictures were just an added bonus. I loved it and will share it with my friends and family. If you haven't gotten it yet..... What are you waiting for. Get on the road of being the you that want to be."

0,Why did Mattie want to be Englisch???  This wonderful story answers the question.  Mattie's need to get away was so painful for her.  She seemed to be rebellious because how her father treated her.  Why did he treat her that way?  I believe he was authoritarian with out the hand of love.  How hurtful the story is and Mattie's leaving causes much pain.  Does Mattie get her happy ever after???  Does she find herself???  Will she succeed in the Englischer world???  You need to read this story to find out.  I loved it and found it an eye opening read regarding rebellion.  Highly recommend this story.

0,"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.  Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.  I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.  This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.  Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting."

I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.  Notice: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion.

0,"Monopoly Electronic Banking certainly reflects the world we live in. I don't know the last time my kids actually saw me pay for anything with cash. In this version of Monopoly each player (up to 6 players) is provided an electronic debit card. With this debit card they purchase properties, pay rent, buy houses, etc.  At first I didn't know how I felt about this money-less version. It sure was easy to set up. No more sorting and counting fake $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills. However, I wasn't sure if my kids would understand that they didn't have an endless supply of money and that how they spent their money had an impact on the games outcome, since they didn't have the money visibly in front of them.  It didn't take them too long to catch on though. By the fourth time around the board they were asking about their balances and not just buying things without some thought.  Also, they easily caught on to how to raise their balance by adding properties, houses, and collecting rent.  The banker controls the electronic device that controls all the money. They have to insert a person's card, input the correct amount of $$$s and push the right button.  It isn't too complicated. If your child is comfortable using a simple calculator they should be able to manage this just fine.  Like the original Monopoly, this isn't a quick game. You can easily spend a couple hours playing. One nice thing that we found about the Electronic version, was the ability to easily take a break from the game. Everyone's balances remained stored on the banking device until we came back to the game and we didn't have to worry about all the loose bills getting scattered. If we want to start a new game, we just hit a single button on the banker's until it resets. Very easy.  I still like the original Monopoly, but this up-dated version is both fun and realistic."

I recently changed from a cover which had a keyboard built into it. That unit worked fine, but I found myself more often than not, using the onscreen keyboard. This is a much simpler cover that looks and performs nicely. I like the ability that this cover gives you to adjust the angle of the screen."

0,"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

They no longer have in-room coffee appliances. You either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room, or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonald's. Internet access is not free ($12.95/24 hours), the 'Gift Shop' is a joke (tucked away in the corner of the coat check room, Concierge services have limited hours, and the business center is open only during 'business hours' which made it difficult to get work done after 'business hours.'

0,"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star."

It was good, but it had some issues with the story.  The first one was a little repetitive, the second one was a little more on the predictable side.  I liked the ending, but I didn't like the way it ended.  I would have liked to see a bit more development on the relationship between the two main characters.  I think it was a good read, but it ended too soon"

These bags must be comfortable for 10 pound dogs, because my dogs were very quiet and calm while riding in them for six hours. No whining, crying, or Benedryl....  These bags are very easy to carry, very easy to load the dog into, and appear to be well made. The purple color is crazy cute, too."

Dragon love prevails and with it comes dragon wars, not to mention doom and gloom for the continuation of the human race. The family connections were easily traceable in this book, and it was nice to reconnect with Lara and her husbands (Nero & Dane), her son and grand-kids. King Darius is one cool King, wish our leaders today could be more like him.  Good read."

So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake. It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back. Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel. When I looked a week later, they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate, so two of my friends didn't come to the trip away. Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound. After about 8 phone calls over 5 months (each saying they would) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150. Overall, the hotel was nice and in a nice location, but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems."

1,"My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Hotel was a short one; although, it was intended to be for five days, it only last two. When me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our Mercedez. The clerk/concierge was on his phone for nearly 5 FULL minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him. When we checked in, we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. We then returned to Lobby, and to our dismay, the hotel had Double Booked the room! After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a 'better' room. The bed was unbearable, the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes (although it was supposedly a non-smoking room). Too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. However, it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room. I needed an Ambien to go to sleep. I woke up with backaches, the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day, and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room. Me and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the Hyatt."

0,"This is a very powerful movie. I have never been a big fan of Jim Carrey, but in this movie he is great and plays the character with much sensitivity apart from humor. Apparently the movie was never a big success in the US, which could be because the subject is too close for comfort.  It brings to mind the story by Gurdjieff of the evil magician, as the movie shows how Truman is really not in control of anything, as it is all orchestrated from above. Just like we like to think we are at the top of the food chain and in control of our lives, so too does Truman believe that he makes real choices and that he is free. Little does he know that he is lives in a ""cage"". To keep Truman from discovering the Truth, the ""media"" is employed to constantly shape his opinions and to suppress any questioning of the reality in which he lives. This has scary parallels to todays world, where the mainstream media and manufactured opinion polls acts like the ancient Greek chorus in shaping public opinion the way the controllers wish it to be.  So definitely a top movie, that won't disappoint. It is a wake-up call to question one's own reality and to whether one is just a machine playing out a script written by someone else."

He still sheds after about 5 weeks.  He's a German Shepherd and I had to take him to a vet for his dry skin.  This product has helped him shed and shed less.  It's very easy to put on and take off and works well.  I use it on my dog who is just 6 months old and it's a little more snug than some other products I've used.  I think it's worth it.  I'm using it for my daughter's puppy.  I've had no problems with her shedding.  It's very absorbent.  My daughter will wear it for a few days before wearing it again.This is my second litter box.  My other one is a bit of a mess and the other one is just too big for my cat's litter box.  I have to replace the old one each time.  The new one is a bit more sturdy and less expensive.  The litter box was a breeze to install, but it took a bit of work for the cats to figure it out.  It is well made and it works well.  The cats are very happy and there is a good litter box.

0,"This is a review for the Disney Princess's: Sparkling Princess Series Collection by Mattel and Disney. Overral this doll is very amazing!  The doll has a golden sparkly crown, (Instead of a bow, we are treated to a nice crown) overall the crown is very satisfying, I really like the extra sparkle in the crown. Snow White's dress is gorgeous as well, the top part is blue with blue sparkles along with a red bow on the end of the top, on the top sleeves we have a puffy part of the sleeve that is baby blue with red color as well added along with it, kinda like a pattern. Next on the bottom part of the dress we are treated with a yellow sparkly color, this part of the dress is probably the most sparkled part of the dress. What I really enjoyed was the cool pictures of apples made out of the yellow sparkles, In Snow White she ate a poisonous apple, which was why this was included in the outfit. But I eventually found out in the Sparkling Princess Mattel Barbie Collection is that they also included different pictures symbolizing parts in the treasured Disney classics in the other dolls as well. The last part of the outfit is the red sparkly shoes, which stay on pretty nicely. Overall I rate the outfit a 5.0. Other than the outfit we have Snow White herself, who in my opinion is one of the prettiest Snow White dolls in the Disney Mattel Doll Collection. She has brown eyes, (Doesn't have much makeup which actually makes her look even more pretty) plain black hair, and pink lips. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the regular looking skin, which in the story she is described to have ""skin as white as snow"", which her skin isn't pale. Actually I bought the Cinderella Sparkling Princess doll as well and found out her skin was more pale. But overall it doesn't bother me. I rate the whole thing full five."

The card is little bit shorter (about 0.5mm) than the depth of the SD card slot (see attached photo) because it is not made for the XPS15, 9560, but it is not a problem.  There is no problem removing it from the laptop with you finger nail.  The manufacturer is not planning to make a custom fitting card adapter for the new Dell XPS15, 956-0, so you have to settle for this adapter if you are looking for flush fitting Micro SD Adapter.  When buying this adapter, make sure to get the right model (103A).  The other models made by BaseQi are either too short or too long or do not fit at all. Prior to buying this, I bought a very inexpensive plastic adapter, and it destroyed the SD card slot's internal card contacts on the first try.  I had to replace the laptop motherboard to correct the damaged card slot.  Yes, the card reader slot is embedded on the motherboard, so there was no other solution but replacing the entire motherboard.  Yes, it was an over $1,000.00 mistake.

While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.  Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.  Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people."

1,"My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation. We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area. This hotel is simply beautiful. From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left, we were treated as if we were royalty. I have never been treated so well. We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite. The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room didn't seem like we were in a hotel, it had the feeling of home. There was a separate living room area which was wonderful, my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. It was mesmerizing. We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping, which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. Most everything is in walking distance. The food was to die for; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. The lounge had a classy feel to it, very relaxing yet sophisticated. We even received a massage, in our room. While we did have all the conveniences of home, such as internet and TV, we did not even think about using them, being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken. I cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here. The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience, which the experience itself is priceless. I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel."

It spent its short life in my laptop satchel and was never dropped or otherwise damaged.  During a photo shoot, I tried to copy data from my full laptop hard drive to the Passport. The drive simply would not work. It was powered on and spinning but the computer could not see it or use it. After trying to get it working, it began making clicking noises and I determined it to be dead.  I'd hate to think that being jostled in my bag was enough to cause this drive to fail. If that's the case, then it has serious durability issues."

1,I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton. My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested. I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up. I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there.

0,"A mysterious letter, a family secret and a sense of wanderlust leads Keelin to leave her life in Boston to travel to a small coastal town in Ireland. It's there where she finds the truth behind her gift and a sense of belonging she's never known before.  This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.  I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.  Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked. I probably would continue this series because I found myself liking some of the secondary characters (who's book is next in the series) slightly more than I liked Keelin and her beau."

Given the size of the bathroom, it should have at least a 70 CFM fan, if not a 100 CFM fan, to achieve the recommended 8 volume changes per hour. Although the sound of the air is lower, the motor now seems to hum louder in relation.

This is one of the better ones and it's around my usual mid-range price point.  The Havana (tobacco) scent is fabulous and unisex; my fiance says it's not an offensive scent, which is a compliment coming from him.  It burns cleanly and evenly from one side of the container to the other.  It doesn't have the best reach like a $60+ candle, but it's better than cheaper candles, and worth it for the pleasant scent.  If you're in the same room you can definitely smell it.

0,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.  Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!"

Rooms have always had two chairs, desk, and usually 22 by 25 feet. Not this room on the 11th floor. It was only 15 X 17 approx.

0,"I have 2 daughters and found this book while searching for a new story about sisters.  The reviews were so good, and the pictures I could see so sweet that I ordered it.  When it arrived I read it to myself and indeed my eyes did smart towards the end.  But instead of thinking about my daughters I found myself thinking of myself and my 2 older sisters.  I related perfectly to the conflicting feelings of the little sister, and to the conclusion in which love for her big sister won out, but she still kept her afternoon alone to herself, something that's hers alone.  I adore the illustrations and feel the story is perfectly told for about 3-7 year olds - just enough repetition for new readers, too.  I'm impressed with the way it addresses the topic of conflict between sisters, without making anyone the bad guy, or without being obnoxious or shallow.  My daughters are still a little too young for this book but I expect it will become a classic in our family.  My highest compliments to this author."

His background makes him a expert in observing society and understanding its trends and dirctions. In a world of cultural confusion and everything goes, he makes you sit back and realize that if the modern pagans succeed in erasing Christian influence from society, all that will follow will be the muck and mire our ancestors fought so hard to escape from. Society today in its ""Post Christian"" age is already showing signs of marked decline. how sad they have not realized that the good old days were not prechristian."

Actually, don't buy those because this will probably go right into the garbage.  The noise is audible to people. Barely, but you can hear it. The noise is really high-pitched and irritating so instead of making my dog shut up, it just made him bark louder. You know how most dogs are with vacuum cleaners? That's how my dog is with the Bark-Off. He'll chase after it and bark bark bark until I turn it off. I tried leaving him alone with it on and it only agitated him further and made his anxiety worse. Save your couple bucks for something else."

0,"Wow Allie Juliette Mousseau has done an amazing job again. This book can be read as a stand-alone! At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.  Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all? I would have to say if you have any problems with violence both physical and sexual this book could trigger your own dreams, but that being said I would recommend this book to others and I for one can not wait to read more about these brothers!!"

0,"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel."

0,"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)  One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.  There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.  Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.  The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful."
0,"I love these towels ....use for pool, beach, and this past Aug. we used for our trip to Disney...it actually helped in 98 degrees to have the towel on your neck (like a scarf)...I totally recommend for outdoors.  As a swimmer, I recommend for the pool, as these things slough off most of the water from your body after being in pool, so you don't have to soak your towel before showering.......Note to self: they are awesome."
1,I am very disappointed in this product and the quality. I will not recommend it to anyone. Great product. Great price. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it works just fine. It is a good value. I use this as a battery charger. The battery works well. I have the phone charged in the car and it is a solid charger. I just wish it came with a charger that could charge my phone with a charge. I have it paired with my Kindle Fire HDX. I am very pleased with this charger. I have been using it for a couple weeks and it has been working flawlessly. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I am using this to hook up my HDX to a computer. It works fine for the price and I would recommend it to anyone.

0,"My son is all about racecars, and loves this toybox. It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the decorating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."
0,"Good story, pretty good movie, loosely based on The Long Walk, a book by Sawomir Rawicz, about his alleged escape from a the Soviet Siberian Gulag and subsequent 4,000-mile walk to freedom in India. Because it's shot on location in various rugged and beautiful locations in in Bulgaria, Morocco and India, the film is visually effective. In short, better than 99% of what passes for movie entertainment, and worth watching."

Views were good, its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. I'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE. I love all the space they have. Flat tv, traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards. Those are very nice! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient. I'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. In any event, I'd recommend staying at the Monaco again!"

0,"I felt the military was covered well. Occasionally the group fleeing the monster encounter military personal fighting the beast and in their utterances we get an update on what's really going on, the big picture. It was probably unrealistic though, or at least some parts of it were unrealistic. 6 hours after Godzilla drops, M1 tanks (our main battle tank) and even heavier artillery pieces are fighting in Manhattan? Didn't earlier in the movie it show one of the bridges into Manhattan being destroyed? Perhaps it was possible. . .  It was only after the movie was over, thinking about it, that I realized what the movie was about (odd that I give a movie I don't understand 10 stars, but I do - I think my date liked it as much or more than I did). I think Cloverfield is about the bravery of the characters. Each character in the movie is braver than I would have been but it is believable."

She followed up and went into more detail about her life as a child/teenager in the foster system and how she was able to pull herself up and be the sucessful intelligent woman she is.

0,"Beautiful earrings! These were delivered to me by my mailman during the middle of my annual memorial day party. Everyone kept asking what did you get??? What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday. These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol. I and the rest of my family would recommend them. They are small, but impressive. It is true what they say that good things come in small packages. I did receive these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."

The constant struggle that Santiago endures through the desert, with love, and with others trying to hold him back can resonate with anyone who wants to achieve their personal best in life.

0,"I purchased a different kit than the one listed.  Mine had the Quick-Change adapter with 7 hex shank high-speed drill bits.  The drill bits are of excellent quality as is the click adapter.  All you have to do to insert a bit is push it in.  To remove it simply pull back on the padded collar of the adapter and the bit pops out.  Unlike Sears, Dewalt, Snapy and other quick adapters that I have used you do not have to pull back on the adapter and pull the bit out at the same time. The Bosch just pops it out.  What impressed me the most however was the lack of run out that the Bosh has.  The wobble that is present at the driver bit or drill bit tip that anyone who has ever used any sort of quick change hex shank adapter is much less noticeable with the Bosch than any I have ever used.  I am a solid surface/laminate fabricator and much of my time is spent installing counter tops and kitchen cabinets where a drill is indispensable for drilling as well as driving.  I have 3 of the Bosch Quick-Change adapters one in a Makita, one in a Dewalt, and one in a Metabo cordless drill.  I would not be without one of these Bosch adapters on the work site.  By the way I also use a Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver which is a pleasure to use and comes with a hex shank quick adapter mounted to the drill shaft instead of a chuck and it has more run-out than these Bosch adapters."

0,"Opened box and cubes are not individually wrapped. When I took cellophane off box white powder residue was on my hands. Not terribly concerned, it had a slight, pleasant odor, and I washed my hands. Several cubes were broken into smaller pieces. All pieces are definitely usable for effective fire starting. Have not tried out as yet, reviewed videos about them before purchasing and don't expect to be disappointed. Will try wet cubes next, before deciding for myself which works best. As I said, after reviewing videos of other peoples experience using these, over other products, decided to order, Only gave 4 stars because of residue and broken pieces. Would prefer to open one cube at a time and use as needed -  I will individually wrap these myself, but that's just a small issue, does not reflect on the quality or effectiveness of the product."

0,We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay. The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. The tub is large and the shower a pleasure. The location was quiet as requested. The staff was always cheerful and very helpful. Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services! The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day. We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay.

There is about 75% less litter on the floor around the box but still some getting on the floor around the mat.  Maybe my cats practicing their long jumps. Maybe they are doing it on purpose because they love to watch me sweep.  The mat is easy to clean and durable.

The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike."

0,"Overall - 2.5 stars You can have the werewolf and eat the cheesecake too. This is a BBW paranormal romance with all the usual elements.  Fantasy World - 2 stars The world is a bit ragged around the edges, and you'll definitely need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the story.  Tingle - 3 stars A hot, naked man shows up on the doorstep, and wants to get busy. What's not to like? The sheik scene is more odd than hot though.  Characters - 3 stars Full of hot, Alpha werewolf stereotypes. Carole's self-esteem issues become tiresome, and I desperately wanted her to get a clue.  Story - 2 stars The plot is a well worn path. Nothing new, but it's still fun to take a stroll down it.  Summary When Carol Anne goes to claim a surprise inheritance from her dead Uncle, she doesn't know it includes a sexy man showing up on her doorstep to provide erotic delights. She's trying to recover from her divorce, and plans to live alone in the country. Unfortunately, Carol Anne doesn't know she's actually close to a hidden werewolf town, and is smack in the middle of a fight between werewolves and panthers.  My Wolf King by Rose Wynters is a fairly standard paranormal romance with familiar elements. It's not going to rock your world, but is more like snuggling into your favorite sweats with a side of cocoa and cookies. You get to visit with hot men who know their mates at once, and a real sized woman who is valued for being more than a twig."

The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai. Then I decided to buy a set that was new, thinking that the reason why the previous one, wouldn't play was because it was used and therefore somehow damaged. Well to my surprise the brand new one had exactly the same problem. therefore I don't recommend this set to any one. By the way all of the players have the latest 4.0 firmware update, so the players should not be the issue."
0,"I hoped that the problem of undersized recoil pads was solved since most of the reviews are a few years old. Turns out, it is sized perfectly for how it is designed. This Pachmayr recoil pad is only 4.600 inches tall, and the original pad on my new 1895 is about 4.730 inches tall. The Pachmayr pad is sized so that you can cut about 1/2 inch off the stock and install the new butt pad with no change to the length of pull. I'm not willing to cut up my stock just yet, so I'll be exchanging this for a grind-to-fit Limbsaver."

The hotel is located in downtown Chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city, we were close to everything. The Hard Rock Hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking. The room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings. The bed was heavenly. The hotel staff was friendly, upbeat and extremely helpful, we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat."

0,"We loved this hotel and would definitely come back. Initially we weren't given a goldfish, which was disappointing, but then we left a tip for the housekeeper, and she rewarded us with one. We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. The staff were quite friendly and helpful, even printing our boarding passes for us. Our room was very comfortable, with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. At first we were worried about noise, since our room was next to the elevator, but we hardly heard it, and didn't notice any street noise either. The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated, well-lit, and ideally located."

0,Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didn't have my size. I am glad I got the blue instead. As it was a nice purchase. It doesn't look like the picture provided by the seller. Nor does it look like something I included in my picture in this review. However its just a nice sky blue colored sweater. Its 100% cotton and didn't irritate my skin. Plus the price point of the sweater was nice as many sweater similar can cost much more. I did receive this product at a discounted price for my review. However this is one of those products that even if I didn't get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase. Just a heads up for style purpose. If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal. I got my size and it fit just right. Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though. If you like your sweaters to fit a little loser than get a size up. That's my suggestion and input.

We live in Louisiana so thunder storms are common. The July 4th fireworks celebrations also causes him a lot of anxiety.  The Thunderchews have worked great on him.  Within minutes it calms him down.  I didn't think it would work that well but am so happy that it does.  Our dog was pitiful during thunder episodes.  I am not sure if it works the same on all dogs but I can testify that for my dog it is a miracle and has a great calming effect.  I will purchase this again when my supply runs out and would recommend it for anyone with a dog who has anxiety with loud noises."

My main annoyance is that the outside is showing wear after only a month.  It has scratches form spots I can not explain.

She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allowing her to see herself. It is shock proof and so far it stands up to that fact as she has dropped it several times, knowing at times she can be clumsy this camera has given me the tranquility to know that this camera will outstand some of the abuse.  The down side that I have found with this camera is that it uses batteries and no charger. We fixed the problem by buying recharger batteries, which is great because she uses the camera quite a lot. Using a 2gb seems to go pretty fast, so I definitely recommending to get a bigger mini memory card. This will help from needing to remove or transfer pictures to another device. The batteries seems to hold for the usage, so don't be scared that it won't last long. Definitely recommend the product!"

The blades are very sturdy, and the pieces are very thin. I would not recommend this product. I have a 2 year old, and I have had to buy blades for her. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing blades for a child. This product is very well made, and the blades are very well made. My son loves it!  He is 6 years old and loves this dollhouse!  We have not had any problems with the kids breaking the locks and the furniture, but my son is not into the dolls at all. He likes the dolls and the little pieces that are made of plastic. The plastic parts are small and don't really work together. It would be nice if this dollhouse had some plastic parts that could be removed. The other items I have purchased are for the wooden pieces. The pieces are very easy to break, and the furniture is very easy to set up and put on. It's not a toy that is easy for a 4 year old to play with. The pieces are very small and don't hold up very well. I would not recommend this dollhouse. I received this item as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it."

0,"Most readers of John Le Carre know him for his more publicized stories; not as many have read back to the beginning.  I started as many readers with the more modern day stories and then I went back and read the famous, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  Comparing the earlier Le Carre to the later day author is night and day.  So I decided to start at the beginning - Call for the Dead.  George Smiley is introduced to us in this book.  He is not the supreme spymaster at this point that he becomes later.  Some may argue this point, as his storied heroics from WWII are on display.  But he is not so confident of his skills or his governmental position.  His personal strife with the divorce of his wife Ann is described and this adds to his personality.  Smiley is not the king of the Secret World at this point and his inexperience is fun to see.  The story is very short on pages, but not on important developments.  At this stage of Le Carre's career, he could say much with few words.  The characters are surprisingly well developed in 128 pages.  The intricacies of the storyline are well thought out and the ending, if not totally surprising, is explained in detail - something that doesn't happen so often in Le Carre's later writings.  I found myself wired in to this story for no other reason that I felt I was watching the manifestations of some of the most famous spy characters in history - Mundt and Smiley.  I can't say that the story is so twisted that the reader can't figure it out, but I will say that the writing is so well done, that you can't help but read every word.  The reader can begin to see the mind of Le Carre as he takes a simple plotline and attempts to weave it a myriad of ways.  If you've liked the later books, treat yourself to this one - the creation."

0,"Stayed in old tower. Room was nice and room service was very good. Room Wi-Fi was expensive as was the bottled water. For the price of the room, at least there should at least have been water. I would rate the value as sub-par. The restaurant menu was not great, food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant.. In summary, I will go to the M... or H... next time. Some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of North Carolina and earlier this year in Northern California. P.S. If you are a fitness room user, the $16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel."

They are very comfortable, and I love the fact that they are made of a hard plastic. The material is very soft, and I have no complaints about them.

0,"First and foremost they claim this is an BBW romance. The author never mentuons that in the book but they do talk about all the time in the gym she spends and how proud she is of her body and her beauty. How he touches her taut abs and toned legs and so on. Yes you can be curvy and fit but I didn't get that from this book. I feel like she is a skinny gym rat. The book itself starts out so boring I  had to force myself to keep reading. It picked up a little at the end but the ""twists"" in the story didn't  intrest me and where kind of sick. Only a handful if males can mate and she was kidnapped after concieving from one night. Then she gets passed around to the brother. They expect her to have sex with him, which she does, and have 20 babies. Then with the upheavals all she is is a vessel. When I read a romance I  do not expect the heroine to have to have sex with different people and be treated like a baby making whore. I am begging anyone reading this review to pass on this book. I don't  know  where all these 5 start reviews came from but they had to have been paid.  Just not a good read to me. I am glad it was on KU or I would  be asking for a refund since it is definitely  not a rereadable book."

The soundtrack is great, and it's great to see a movie that is so different and different from the rest of the movie. The acting is also great.

0,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.  I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.  Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

I think its a great toy with a great opportunity to learn what is essentially a basic programming lesson. You are programming this little guy by configuring his parts. It is a really cool idea, and the fact that you can get additional parts is even cooler. He makes great sounds and is lively. I recommend for a fun, programming oriented toy for a kid 3+."
1,"Overall, I like this vacuum.  I have an old one that I used for a couple of years.  I have had it for a couple of months now and it works great.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would have made cleaning easier.  I also love the 2 filters that come with it.  I have a hard time getting the filter into the container when I have to use it to filter water.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after using it.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after it has been stored in a refrigerator or freezer.  I have a hard time getting it in the dishwasher.  I do like the color and the fact that it has a rubberized seal.  It is also a little heavier.  I don't have to worry about the metal being broken.  I like the fact that it has a plastic cover that makes cleaning easier.  I like the fact that it is a little bigger than my old vacuum.  I have been using it for several months now and it is doing a good job.  I am very happy with the purchase.Very nice and sturdy!

0,"The location of the hotel is great, right on the river and Michigan Ave. Almost everything is within walking distance. At the price, though, and given the 4 star hotel, we expected better walls. Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors. The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear. We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone (he clearly wasn't speaking loudly), and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk. We asked them to be quiet (I shouldn't have expected that to work with some young drunks) then called security, but they did nothing. I was completely annoyed with the noise, especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one. Unless you are in Chicago to party, get drunk, and not get any sleep, I wouldn't stay here."

0,"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.  Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.  Would recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!"

0,"Update: What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.  Original review: This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.  Pros: Price  Cons: The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small) The blade doesn't come off for cleaning Not durable"
0,"Eerie, twisty suspense with two lovers at the heart of it. I love the flashbacks that describe George's history with Liana and explain how blind he is to her dangerous potential. She is one very sexy lady. This feels like a cool indie thriller movie--quirky, very personal and idiosyncratic, but wholly believable. The scene on the boat near the end just had me jumping out of my chair. Not expecting THAT one, I can tell you! Very happy I found this one."

They are a little on the slim side.. could have been a little deeper, but I only say that because I am into the complicated 1,000 piece puzzles. But it all fits between these. YOU CAN STACK THEM!! They can be stacked criss crossed or one on top of another. They even fit back in the box all together! I love how this keeps my puzzle area so organized! I am beyond happy with my purchase!

0,"Well, what a shocker, I really did like this movie a ton! I had my doubts and was fighting myself forever on whether I would see it or not and I am very glad that I did. I sometimes think that Melissa McCarthy is the same in every movie but sometimes she gets it right and here she did. She plays the quiet shy girl who assists an agent in the field, Jude Law and he gets killed and well she takes up the reigns. she infiltrates the bad guys led by Rose Byrne, so funny, and has to stave off the attempts by a rogue agent, Jason Statham, hysterical. I got a good many laughs from this movie and I do recommend it most highly. Melissa herself had me cracking up."

0,"This is a great documentary that really brings you as close to the action as you can get on film. Andy Rooney started out as a reporter on a B-17 aircraft and takes you through a mission that he experienced. It shows you the tragedy of planes not returning and young men coming back from the battle dead or wounded. It also includes interviews of several veterans of the air war. When I watch this film, I try to visualize what it was like to be shot down in a B-17, then captured and put into a NAZI's prison camp as my uncle was! Would I have found the strength to endure?"
0,"Had read that this was a good story, so when I was looking for a tale set in Ireland this fit the bill. It could be viewed as a typical police procedural, but it's much more thanks to the great characterizations throughout the book.  It's a unique (to me, at least) story of a detective investigating a crime that may or may not be connected to a mystery in his own past. Along the way he and his fellow police are drawn in such believable ways that they begin to jump off the page. I kept visualizing the scenes as though it was a movie or mini-series (as the complexity of the characters and the interior visualizations drawn could not be contained in a two hour film).  It's most intriguing that this is the first in a series, but to say more would be unfair. Looking forward to reading more of them."

They could have lived in the desert and not with humans and they didn't have a life in the desert. They were in the desert because the humans had developed a habit of eating people, not just animals.  I found the movie to be very entertaining and it was not as long as I thought it would be.

It was good, but it had some issues with the setting. The first one was a little repetitive, the second one was a little more on the simplistic side. I liked the ending, but I didn't like the way it ended. I would have liked to see a bit more development of the relationship between the two main characters. I think it was a good read, but it ended too quickly. I read this book in order. I had some problems with the writing, but I didn't get into the issue at all.

When it was hinted at in one of the previous books that Parker wanted privacy because of his BDSM inclinations, I thought a little more of it would be written in here. Instead there was almost none.

0,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.  I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.  This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."

1,"After a few months of use, the quality has improved.  The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because I am a 32 year old man, so it is not that big of a deal.  If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely go with a smaller one. I did have a problem with the opening on the back of the bag, but I had to use a little lubricant on it.

I was skeptical but he was fine.  The vet said if it's too small, the vet will tell me to try something else.  I got this for my other cat and it seems to work well.  I have a 60 lb. cat and it is a little too big for him.  I will definitely continue to try it out.  He has had it for a couple weeks and it seems to be doing great.  I am hoping that I can see how well it does.I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for him to stretch out.

0,"A romantic mystery with a touch of suspense.  An Opportunity Seized caught my attention with its name. I immediately thought that this was a workplace/office mystery. After reading the book I am still not sure what the title has to do with the story.  Toni is an heiress, the daughter of a mining magnate, who just wants to be normal whereas Jason is ex-military and co-owner of Haven Security. Jason is the bodyguard hired by Tonis father.  While guarding her he develops feelings for her. She falls for him, too. A relationship that was almost impossible to begin with is tested when a mining accident threatens the whole family.  One thing I liked about the relationship was that though both of them were immensely attracted to each other, they also get to know each other on a deeper level than just chemistry. This part of their relationship is shown clearly after the mining accident.  Readers who enjoy frequent sex will be pleased with this short story. It wasn't the hard core erotic variety but there is enough to make a reader who isn't used to reading it to possibly become either uncomfortable or start blushing like crazy.  That being said this is still a mystery. I think the beginning was a little slower than the ending. The ending seemed a little fast paced, which I loved.  This is a romantic mystery, heavy on the sexual elements. It worked for me because there was enough of the mystery plot to offset some of the romance.  The ending was a full of surprises. The twists and turns and the new information that were revealed kept me reading to the very end.  originally posted at long and short reviews"
0,"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is."

This book takes a look at the importance of self-esteem and self-help to help you become more self-confident and more successful. The story is told from Jane's point of view. I was quite surprised to see that the author is working on her self-help book.

0,"Television reporter Jessica Rowan is covering the San Antonio Generals bachelor auction and is livid after her friend, Charlene Simmons, bids for her to win a date with NHL winger, Ryder Carrigan. The last thing alternate captain, Ryder Carrigan, wants to do is participate in a bachelor auction.  However, when the two meet they might have more in common than they would have expected.  This contemporary sports romance is suitable for new adult and adult audiences.  I like Ryder.  He is serious about hockey to a fault.  I appreciate after Ryder was called out by one of his teammates, he realizes that he needs to achieve more balance in his life.  This is a valuable life lesson that can benefit everyone.  I felt bad that Jessica was blindsided at the auction, but I love that her friend bid on Ryder for her.  They have some obstacles to overcome that make the story interesting. The two have great chemistry and make an excellent couple.  At ninety-seven pages, this story is a fast and captivating read that I finished in one sitting.  I enjoyed the charity scene in the beginning and thought that was a clever way for the characters to get together.  Chasing the Prize is a fun story and entertaining read.  Im looking forward to Casey and Charlenes story next in Book six, Making an Impact."

0,"I am a fan of Doreen Owens Malek, her dialogue is witty and she steadily builds the romantic tension between her leads. Her novel, A Marriage of Convenience, is an enjoyable read albeit this is an older novel and there is a sense of the characters being behind the times in many ways.  Sharon Phillips returns to her father's ranch in California after his death, she is not happy to be in the Golden state though because she must face her first love, Taylor Braddock. Sharon fell in love with Taylor when she was only eighteen when she visited her father for his wedding to Taylor's mother. Taylor broke her heart and she has not been in contact with him since.  Taylor is a Vietnam vet (yes, this is dated) and he has had major difficulties adjusting back into civilian life. He was a POW and he deals with his memories with alcohol and a bad temper. He is about ten years older than Sharon and he finds her sweet and innocent, way too innocent for the likes of him so he sends her on her way making her believe that she is way too young for his jaded tastes.  Ten years later the two are forced to confront their feelings because Sharon's dad has bequeathed the ranch to the both of them but they must marry to inherit. They decide to go through with a marriage with plans to annul it fairly quickly but Sharon realizes her feelings for Taylor have not gone away.  This novel deals with some big issues like post traumatic stress, loneliness and fear. Taylor is very complex and he is hurting. His transformation from an angry young man to a mature businessman is believable. Sharon is not as interesting as Taylor (how could she be, she's a run-of-the-mill lawyer in Philadelphia) but she is generous and it is her giving heart that makes such a difference in Taylor's life."

( LMI)  It works exactly as advertised for filling grain, especially in fine hardwoods like those used in guitar building or refinishing. Dries fast and clear. Sands easily. Very little odor. Non toxic. Water based. Builds fast but is not a heavy tone-killing finish so it is great for acoustic or semi acoustic instruments. Remember to do small sections, because it dries fast. Other than that small caution, I can wholehearted recommend this water based finish. You can see a good demonstration video here: [."

0,"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you. Overall, a great buy at a great value."
0,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here."

(The third cat does not like treats in general.)  When my finicky-but treat-loving cat won't eat his food, we crumble one or two of these on top like it was salt or pepper and it gets him to eat."

I received a set of new torches shortly and only two worked after a few months.  I thought maybe I needed new rechargeable batteries for the two that didn't work so I took the batteries out of the good ones and put them in the ones that didn't work-it still didn't work.  7/3/14 The reason I bought these tiki lights were because they looked really nice but my purchase experience was not too pleasant.  When the lights failed shortly after my purchase I thought that was that and therefore the one star review, however, the seller reached out to me to replace them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this company stood behind their product.  I just received a new set today that they sent me just in time to enjoy the ambience in my backyard for the Fourth of July.  Although I gave the product a one star rating I give this company a 5 star rating for their excellent customer service."

It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the ground. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the back of a truck. It is very sturdy. It has a nice handle that makes it very comfortable. It is also a very light weight. We used it in our hammock, but it was a little difficult to get it to hang down. So, if you are looking for a hammock that is very light and heavy, this hammock is perfect! We used it in our hammock and it was a little difficult to get it to hang down."

It works great with my ipad 3 it charges really fast and the adapter has a built in feature that doesn't let the battery get too hot or overcharge it. The only thing that it's not so great is that the ipad faces up and I would have liked it to be a little more bendable. Other than than its a great product and I would definitely recommend it. It's a dock/charger/stand/case. Ohh and another thing I would have changed its that you have to slide it out a little to adjust volumes because the case covers it.

0,"I love these books by Cynthia Wright! When I first looked at this series I thought that Natayla was Alec's sister (From Caroline) it was such a wonderful surprise to find that it was his daughter. I thought that it was a great way to carry one the family line.  I was sad to know that this was the last book in this series. I love the way that Natalya knows her own mind and has no problem stating that. The interaction between the different characters is smooth and flowing. It was great to revisit characters from other stories and see how that progress. As a history teacher I find historical detail accurate and impressive. I feel that she manages to capture how people actually acted in that time accurately. The author does not shy away from writing about the hardships that people dealt with during that time, which is refreshing to see. I do hope that she continues to write about these families!"

0,"I have two bomb-dropping male cats. These boys seem to enjoy stinking up my office, which is the only place their litter box fits in my home. I prefer natural-everything but couldn't stand the terrible smell emitted from the litter box that stayed long after scooping. I've been using Tidy Cats clay litter which not only creates a lot of dust but tracks all over my damn house. On a whim, I decided to try this brand of pellets. What I've found is that the optimum freshness occurs when I pour about 2/3 of this product and then 1/3 of the tidy cats on top. The cats mix it together when they bury their treasure, and I haven't had ANY odor issues. I also don't have the excessive tracking anymore. I do agree with another reviewer that stated it would be difficult to see any blood in the cat stool, but that's a chance I'll have to take. Just ordered 3 more bags because at this price, it's a steal. Thanks Blue Buffalo."

It's small enough to fit my old bread mixer and it works great.  The mixer seems to be a little bigger than I expected.  However, the size is perfect for my kitchen.  It's perfect for my dining room table.  The mixer is very quiet and easy to use.  I like that it is made of aluminum so that it doesn't have a handle.  The mixer works well and is a bit easier to use.  I haven't tried the mixer on the kitchen counter yet, but I'll see how that turns out.I really like the color of this pillow case"

They will pack well and should work fine for the type of snorkeling we will be doing. The raspberry color is bright and may not disappear again like my old blue pair.

0,"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!  I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion."

0,"Well, that's that... I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening.  I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback. I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix. The end of this book was fairly decent.  I can't say this book was better than the last two, however."

My dog loves it more than expensive Canidae. Soon she was eating more Newmans than the expensive brand. She is fit and trim, her coat is healthy and pretty. She has no tell-tale itching associated with inferior dog food. The ingredient list of Newmans own is IMPRESSIVE! I have continued receiving this dog food on the subscribe and save program. It arrives to my front porch every month. Im totally happy with the product and the service from Amazon. Ive never seen Newmans own dog food at any retail store. My dog has eaten this food for 2 years."

0,"I really looked forward to getting these having read the reviews but so far have found them awkward in the following ways: 1. The fenders tend to warp easily meaning that if they follow the cross-section curvature at the brake end, they will be way off center at the mud flap end.  You can do a limited amount of adjusting but so far I haven't managed to get it quite right 2. Creep - be careful and don't try to get them too close to the tire - no closer than 3/8ths of an inch, otherwise with vibration the forward end of the blade will creep down towards the tire and several times I have caught it between the tire and the brakes.  I would recommend keeping the blade about 3/4 of an inch from the rear brake. 3. I use these only occasionally - in Colorado we don't have much rain, so they are on and off, mainly during the winter - they are easy to install, but I do seem to have to spend a lot of time aligning them properly.  Might be easier for someone who leaves them on for longer periods - I don't know.  I've had them for a couple of months - will stick with them but my enthusiasm has been dented a bit."

1,"I was skeptical about purchasing this set, as it is a little pricey for a small set, but I think it is a nice set.  The basic game is pretty simple, and the concept is fun.  The cards are a bit messy for the most part, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun.  There is a lot of replayability in this set, and there is a lot of depth to it.  The cards are very easy to play, and the art is pretty good.  You can play with any of the eight different sets, and it's really easy to play.  The cards are also very well made, and the art is pretty good.  There are also a lot of different ways to play, and the rules are pretty clear.  You can also play with the different sets of cards, but I think this is really fun.  Overall, a great set for any kid.Great game for the kids.  My boys love it.Fun game, but not very popular with kids.  The game is fun to play, but not very ""serious"".  I would not recommend this game."
0,"Item was delivered promptly and placed where I requested it to be left. I am disabled and home alone so there is no one to pick up mail and packages for me. Our front door/porch is facing the street and is wide open. Our street has been known for many packages stolen through many years. Also, The front door leads to a hallway (2 family).  Neither of us have ever used the front door. I have always used the door upstairs in back of the house and our neighbor uses their side door.  Anyway, along with other reasons, I prefer that my packages be delivered either ON the back steps (first platform) OR the top of the stairs on my porch, especially if pkgs are big/heavy. I have medical supplies delivered and do not want them stolen. So THANK YOU!!! for making sure the mail-person followed directions."

0,"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing."

0,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).  Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.  So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!"

0,"MagWorld tiles are fun for kids, and they inspire imaginative play.  My 4-year-old daughter loves to play with these.  There is a good variety of shapes and sizes, and this 60-piece set is a nice size.  I think if you had a smaller set, it would be difficult to build much, but 60 is enough.  The reason I am giving these four stars instead of five is that these tiles are clearly not as ""sticky"" as MagnaTiles, which are also significantly pricier.  These tiles do not stick together as well because the tiles are thicker, which has the effect of making the magnets seem weaker.  There may be an added safety benefit in that these tiles are more difficult to break, but the extra ""stickiness"" of MagnaTiles is appreciated by my daughter."

1,"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July. For a 'luxury' hotel this place did not meet my expectations. For starters, we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for at least another hour! I'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee. Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel's restaurants, Kitty O'Sheas. Well, we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks. Once we finally got to our room it was OK, although not great for the price. We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view, and there were not extra towels as I had requested. We had to call room service twice to receive them, then another two times because our air conditioner wasn't working. Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone. Next time I'm in the Chicago area I won't be staying at the Hilton. I'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money."

0,"I like and admire cats, but I'm a dog person. And I've never been fond of cleaning up after indoor cats. We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.  We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.  I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.  This thing is well-engineered:  Most of the litter stays in the box. It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean. Very easy to clean. Anti-microbial without any chemical odors. Holds a boatload of litter. Tucks into a corner.  Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!"
0,"The original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' published in 1855 contained twelve poems only. The subsequent editions beginning in 1856 were to greatly expand the work. Thus I would recommed that anyone who wishes to know the true range of Whitman's work find another selection of his work of which there is a larger share of his great work. Whitman is the poet who Emerson prophesied, the American visionary poet who sang of the complex greatness of the society, and connected his own soul with its expansive facts of life."

The first person point of view felt odd as she seemed to talk to the reader and expressed her thoughts.

0,"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.  ""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.  I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.  Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.  Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.  If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.  Recommended (the price is certainly right - I paid only $10.86 with tax for both movies!), but not for the squeamish."

I wish I had had gotten it a little wider to hold the top of the box, but I don't. I would have given the smaller box a 4, but I don't think I would have gotten it a 5. I would have given it a 4 because of the plastic cover. I would have given it 4 stars if I could. I just wish I had gotten a different cover.

0,"I thought this looked cute but couldn't quite tell what was in it based on the picture.  Well, there are 3 lip glosses that are the goopy kind of lip gloss, not the solid kind.  So those were confiscated immediately as well as another 3 lip gloss set (that I actually thought was eyeshadow at first but was disappointed when I opened it and found more goopy lip gloss.  The nail colors are hideous but that didn't matter to me.  LOL!  My daughter would love them no matter.  She hasn't put the polish on yet but after I see how it coats, I'll come back and update.  The bag to carry it all in is cute and the lipsticks are colored but don't actually produce much of anything but a clear coating which is great b/c I really don't want that everywhere."

1,My kitty loves this and it has kept her occupied for a long time.  She does not chase it and it seems to be a great value for the price
0,Purchased this for my grandson.  He loves it.  Great variety of pieces and the buildings and vehicles that come with the table provide opportunity for imagination.  The one problem that we encountered is that the engine of the train provided is too tall to go under the bridge of the set.  This proves to be very frustrating to my grandson who really has problems with things of this nature.  He likes to be in control of the environment and wants things to work as they are designed to work.  I also paid extra to Amazon to have it gift wrapped and the paper was torn and box dinged up upon delivery.  I had to re-wrap the gift to make it presentable.  It could have been packaged better by Amazon.  Bubble wrap around gift wrap to keep packaging secure.  Other than that it seems to be a great purchase that will provide my grandson with hours of fun and entertainment.

0,"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).  I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.  Let me get what I don't like out of the way:  --wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution) --wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)  And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:  --the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac. --backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area) --fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management --first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm  What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time."

I am very pleased with the quality of the product.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too big for me.  I am 5'5"" and the size was a little too small for my shoulders.  The straps on the belt were too big.

1,"While the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience, they fail to deliver. Unless of course, a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door. If you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed. The 'A' list celebrities will not be there. In fact, it would be rare to find anyone on the 'B' list either. The party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert. The party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar. The walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played. As for the promise of Art Deco, it must have changed in definition. Your room will truly look like a concert has just been held. The carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer. The bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description. Quality service and amenities were severely lacking. Guests are not greeted with warmth but with disdain. Do not bother complaining about the noise next door either. It is part of you unique experience. The only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago. It was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip."

She loves these T.V. shows & she learns a lot from them (she can count up to 10, knows all of her shapes & colors,  knows the letters of the alphabet, can understand & speak some -a fairly good amount of- Spanish, her vocabulary is way above the level of a 3 year old, and she can read some words in books).  She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving). This DVD will be especially good for the long trips we take (over 2 hours). Anyone with little ones will know how much education kids can absorb while watching something they enjoy! I highly recommend this DVD."

0,"One word sums up the follow up to The School for Mysteries: A Cozy Paranormal Adventure (Nurse Phoebe Book 2) and that is ""disappointment"". The predecessor was such a fun and exciting read in which the middle aged protagonist goes on a very wild adventure full of page turning thrills such as a heart stopping pursuit by unknown enemies, a murder attempt, etc. Even though that book's ending felt a little abrupt, I was still eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. If the last book fell short in the ending, this follow up more than compensates by having too much filler on the history and descriptions of French castles and its prior inhabitants. It felt as though Ms. Jourdan was promoting French tourism instead of focusing on her characters. The book did not actually pick up pace until the half way mark and even then her nemesis was hardly developed as a character. I absolutely love Phoebe's character and hope that if Ms. Jourdan continues the series that she brings back the exciting energy of the previous book because this one fell flat."
0,"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.  I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.  I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.  I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another."

0,"Nine Lorien teenagers were sent to earth to await their legacies, special powers that each possess, in order to return to their planet to save it. Number Four, Daniel Jones, is moving from Florida to Paradise, Ohio, with his new name, John Smith, and his Cepan, or guardian, Henri.  In Paradise, John tries to start a life as he acquaints himself with Sarah Hart, a friendly, smart ex-cheerleader. Of course, with an ex-cheerleader there's an ex-boyfriend, Mark James, who isn't so happy about the chemistry between John and Sarah. As John begins to fall for Sara, she becomes another person who would be in danger from the Mogadorians, another alien race that are hunting the Lorien teens.  Each Lorien teen is at a different place on Earth. Three have already been caught and killed, which is made clear through the scars on each of the remaining teens' ankles. As another one dies, another scar will appear in order to determine who will be hunted next. Because of a charm, the nine teens must be killed in their chronological order. As number four, John knows he's next.  Despite its controversial co-author, one can't argue that I AM NUMBER FOUR reads just like a script, so it's no surprise that it has been turned into a movie. The novel itself has scenes that are so action-packed, with a little romance thrown in, that it will captivate readers of all ages.  With the sequel, THE POWER OF SIX, releasing in August 2011, only read I AM NUMBER FOUR if you are willing to become addicted to another series.  Reviewed by: Randstostipher ""tallnlankyrn"" Nguyen"

Unfortunately, the research and writing (and copy editing) have gotten so sloppy as to be disracting. Several times in the first few pages ""criteria"" is used as a singular noun (ie, the criteria is...). Biceps is parsed to bicep, as if that makes it singular, and, most amusingly, during a scene at a Lakers' game, Kobe Bryant banks in a foul shot to win the game. I'm pretty sure Kobe has never banked in a foul shot intentionally. All in all, a lazy effort."

Accompanied by her partner, Agent John Tomasetti they discovered the bishops wife cradling a newborn baby in her arms. The bishop had heard knocking at around 4am and when he opened the front door and found the basket on his front step, he was shocked. But the baby girl seemed healthy and was obviously only a few hours old  she was wrapped in a quilt with a wooden rattle beside her  both of which Kate was sure were Amish  With few clues to help them out, Kate began the search for the mother of the infant. But would she find her? And what would be the story behind the abandonment of a healthy baby girl  why would anyone do such a terrible thing?  Absolutely loved this short story by Linda Castillo!

0,"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.  It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.  The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.  So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.  I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.  UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry."

0,"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.  Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.  Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set."

0,"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more. I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase."

Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2.

1,One of John Wayne's best films. The story is a good one. There is a lot of action. There is a lot of gunfights and then the fight between the two leads is very cool. A little bit of a gory scene.

0,"Magic might not be enough to get Harry Dresden out of trouble in Jim Butcher's Storm Front. Take one private detective, a heavy dose of magic, intriguing murders, and a splash of humor and you have the recipe for this delightful novel. Harry Dresden uses his wizarding skills to solve cases, and his self-deprecating humor, intelligence, and good nature make him a character a reader can relate to. The action moves the book at a good pace, and I found myself smiling and even laughing out loud. I feel like we've scratch the surface of this fantastic world Butcher has created. I'm thrilled to discover we have a lot more books to read in The Dresden Files. Storm Front by Jim Butcher is a must read for those people who enjoy urban fantasy and detective mysteries."

I had a friend who had knee problems for a while and was very skeptical that it was possible to use a knee brace.

0,"** spoiler alert ** I liked the first Jack Reacher book but Die Trying was a mess. ***Warning Spoilers***. Very little worked for me in this book. A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting caught and the bad guys still don't kill him. Ok, that's a thriller trope, I can live with that, but it's pretty extreme in here.. None of the FBI agents behave like you would expect an FBI agent to. We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch. Militia members would know that so Child comes off sounding like a neophyte."

0,"This is a nice food for older dogs.  The kibble is a good size.  My older labrador took to it immediately, wolfing it down right away.  I was very impressed that the food caused no stomach upset, even though we switched to it without blending his old food.  In fact, his regular ""old dog"" gas was actually greatly reduced using this food, which is a major plus.  I also really like the fact that it has anti-oxidants.  The only downside is that the first ingredient is corn meal, which is a little disappointing.  However, my dog loves this food and it seems to be easy on his digestive tract, so overall I think this is a good food for older dogs."

The author has written a lot of fiction, but this one is the most realistic. I liked the story well enough. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, but like a good historical fiction story, it is hard to find a good historical novel."
1,5 stars as always with this book. It is a great book for a beginner to the craft. Great job!I liked this book but the writing was a bit slow. The story was a little rushed. I would have liked to see more of the characters in the book. I could have read the book in one sitting.
0,"Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY, I had very high expectations. When I saw the Trip Advisor rating, I immediately booked. What a huge disappointment: -- The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap, foam pillows -- the kind they sell in the store for $4. You cannot sleep on these -- The windows are so thin, you can hear the buzzing from walk/don't walk sign on Superior below. -- The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked, I was awaken around midnight, my room engulfed in smoke odor. A call downstairs yielded no results -- There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood; the desk chair was full of loose threads -- The water flow is very weak, but the towels are nice -- There are unpainted floorboards, the kind you find in Day's Inn -- They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like. The sign outside is also a banner. Having stayed all over the U.S., you are better off at Red Roof -- this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain. Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008. I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand. Good heart, but the problems are not fixable."

I'm not chubs, slimmer side BUT with a tummy apparently..I wish it was gone but oh well. Now I got a medium..the torso part goes all the way to my under boobs. I haven't tried making it go higher. But I can say my thighs and stomach feel tighter. It also lifts your butt, which is a plus! Give it a try. You can't tell you're wearing it and it doesn't cause pain when breathing.  Cons: it's tight, not as tight from the stomach as I would like. I did read some reviewers left this comment as well. It doesn't hurt from the torso as others do. The glue type of plastic in the back line helps it adhere to your skin so it doesn't roll.  Pros: I thought the material would be thicker. But nope, they feel like nylons! A bit tighter than nylons. Be careful when pulling it, you can rip it. I haven't ripped mine so we're good.  BIGGEST Q&A: What the heck is the bottom opening for? It is too overlapping and small to be used for the restroom..unless you're a male, don't even think about it because I'm sure you're bound to get your hands dirty..so -1 for that!"

Romantic, passionate and thrilling read. Loved this Elizabeth and Darcy. The plot was plausible and so were their reactions.  Loved how Elizabeth coaxed Darcy by humour and other means of persuasion rather than being insulted or timid.  The story begins as they leave their wedding breakfast and the night does not end well. The next morning comes with reconciliation and their bond grows stronger until a message is sent to Darcy from his former mistress brother. Instead of confiding in Elizabeth, he tries to manage the escalating problems on his own but Elizabeth is on to him...  Really loved this book and would love a sequal to see how Georgiana and Kitty got along. Their stories are left hanging. And of course, I can never get enough of ODC...  Heartily recommend this book!"

0,"I liked this book. Some of the reviews sound like they were written by over-inflated self-important critics ... particularly when they delve into deep spiels about character development and narrative values. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE ! As to my feelings, like most serial books that offer the first volume free, this one stops short of finality. But, if it was finished the author would not realize any financial gain, and would not continue.  I felt the narrative to be snappy, action-filled and the plot line surprisingly well thought-out. This is zombies in an urban environment, so the killing is massive, graphic and almost never-ending. This volume at least ends on a positive note and entices the reader to go on, with out leaving that ""what happened?"" feeling you get from the cranked out pulp. Read it ... you will most likely like it."

I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she loves it! She is a little rough with it but she has had no problems with it. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too hard for her to put together. She is 5 1/2 and still loves it. The pieces are sturdy and are easy to put together. They do not come apart easily, but I did have to break a few pieces. It is a great learning tool for girls.If you are looking for a little more fun for your kid, this is a good buy.  My daughter was very excited to get this for her birthday and she plays with it all the time.  We have played with it at least once a week for about a week.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to be a very durable toy.  But I can't say that it isn't.  I was worried that it might break, but it did not.  I think it will last for a long time.  I think it will last for years.  We will probably be purchasing a bigger version of this one.  It is great for coloring, but I would not recommend it for children under 4 years old.We love this toy!

0,"I just got a Schwallbe Marathon Plus bike tire  size 700X35C for the back of my recumbent.  it feels and performs great.  I think it's going to be a great tire for touring this summer.  It's really built to take a beating.  I'm running XLC Thorn resistant tubes, which are also very think and tough.  The only downside I see is that this setup is very heavy, which might turn some people off.  However, I'd rather go a little slower and not have to stop and fix flats.  I think this tire/tube combo will become my new favorite, especially when touring and carrying weight on the back of the bike.  I've had a Schwallbe Marathon on the front for four tears and never had a flat.  Bottom line:  It's a great tire that is built for punishment and extreme conditions."

0,"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.  For me, a thread of unbelievability runs throughout the movie, which could easily have been fixed had the producers hired a genuine SST astronaut as an advisor to the script."

I'm not sure this really even matters, but it bothers me. On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever seen long nose locking pliers, old or new, that didn't have a little wobble in the open jaw. All of the curved jaw pliers are fine, so I'm giving them  a four over the two loose jaws."
1,"We live near a small hospital and I thought we'd take a chance on a small size dog bed. We had a bed for our dog and the bed was so big it was barely big enough for her. She's a very small dog and I thought it would be a bit too small. Unfortunately, the bed is too big for her and I think she has already been able to get used to it. But, she's a very small dog and I'm glad we did this. I'd recommend this bed for anyone with small dogs or puppies. Pros: - It's easy to put together, it's not heavy, it's not heavy, and it's lightweight."
0,"Everything about this movie captivated me right from the start.  It's sort of slapstick, but i just loved the portrayal of the characters.  The casting was perfect. The story was interesting, the visuals of the little town were enchanting, filmed in Malta, it carried me away to a fairy tale land and a real mental vacation.  I'm an old lady but I found it irresistible."
1,I purchased this for my daughter's iPad mini and she loves it.  It's been a great buy and I'm sure I will use it in the future.This is a great product. It is well made and the cover is very thick. I like the way it looks. I love it. I have a portable player and I can use it on my laptop. I also use it on my ipad and it is great for gaming. I like that the screen is very small and that the back is a little smaller. I use it on my ipad and it is very easy to use and use

It is a must see for any movie lover.I didn't think this was going to be a great movie but I really enjoyed it. The acting was excellent and the acting was great. The story line was very interesting and interesting. I liked the fact that it was not just a movie but a movie that people thought would be funny. I don't think it was a movie that was made for kids and adults. I don't think it was made for them to watch. I think it was made for adults and the kids are really into it.

I can't wait to see what happens in the next book. This was a very good story. The characters were well developed. I liked the way the story line was told and the book was well written. I liked the ending. I liked the fact that the two main characters were a good couple. I liked the fact that the author gave the reader a good story line. This was a great book. It was fast paced and well written. The characters were well developed. It was a fun read.

I love the off white color and the subtle design. It elevates the plain white sugar and creamer bowl to something beautiful. Now, I have to talk myself into wrapping it instead of keeping it for myself. Seller provided very quick shipping. It arrived 6 days ahead of schedule. It was packaged well and protected with extra packing. I'm very happy with this purchase."

0,"I was bitten by the Spyder years ago, and have learned one valuable thing. If I see a Spyderco I like, I jump on it immediately, as the company discontinues models all of the time. Often, a model will return briefly in a limited edition ""sprint run"", and those generally sell out quickly because of a wide collector base.  This model is small, tough, and insanely sharp. At this price, if you've considered collecting, this one is a good start. Legendary quality on a knife that may or may not be around for long."

0,"I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3. Since the Surface is pretty limited on USB slots, I thought it would be best to have a Bluetooth mouse so that I wouldn't have a dongle filling up my singular USB slot. I also wanted to have a small mouse that I could easily carry in my laptop bag. This mouse is great in terms of those two things. I was actually very happy with this mouse upon arrival. Connectivity was easy, the size was great, and the look of the mouse is nice too.  Now after 4 months of use I find that my left click is starting to stick. It's only happening about once or twice per day but I feel like it's a problem that's only going to get worse over time. I'm hoping I'm wrong but we shall see. If this started happening after even 1 year of daily use, I would feel like I had gotten my money's worth but to be happening after only 4 months is very disappointing."
0,"As usual, Harry Bosch is a fascinating enigma; Michael Connelly is a master at the police procedural. It is New Years Day and a dog finds a bone in the Hollywood Hills. The dogs owner, a physician, knows the bone is human  a 10 to 12 year-old boy.  Thus begins an intriguing case that makes lots of hard turns. The murder occurred 20 to 25 years before and the victim was brutalized on a regular basis.  The case is fascinating, Harrys love interest and their relationship is not. Julia, a boot, is a mature woman who went through the police academy months earlier.  As sharp as Harry is, he begins a relationship with her rather quickly  even though it is against LAPDs policy for a supervisor and new recruit to be romantically involved. I just didn't feel that the relationship was real; the interactions seemed wooden.  One of the things that I like about Michael Connelly is that he isn't afraid to take chances with his main character, Harry. The case provides one surprise after another but the ending was a shocker.  Harry Bosch by Michael Connelly 1. The Black Echo (1992) 2. The Black Ice (1993) 3. The Concrete Blonde (1994) 4.

0,"It grinds. That is about the best I can say about it. I bought this in April 2017.  To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one. But this was a waste of money.  I think I'll go back to the Breville we had for a few years (which ironically had worse reviews than this one!)."

0,I don't usually get jazzed about flashlights but this model has a lot going for it and I have bought three of them.  It uses standard AA batteries instead of the more exotic ones.  It is really bright.  If comparing the beam to a mini mag light you will be amazed at the difference.  The light is well built and solid.  The modes don't matter to me so that is not a subtraction.  You can get a better flashlight and you can spend ten times as much if you really want to.  At this price point this is a great choice.

I wish I would have known about it before it went on sale. Great product, very durable. My son loves this toy. The kids were excited about it, but it was a bit small. We had to take it apart. So we had to buy it from Amazon. We bought it for a Christmas gift for my son. I am going to order another for him. Very cute!This is a great starter kit for little ones.

1,This product is great and works well. It is thick enough to make it hard to throw. If you want to throw a tennis ball then the plastic part should be strong enough to go through it. It is a perfect size for my dogs and is perfect for them. I have 2 dogs with medium to large chests and they have never had problems with this ball. I just put it on them and they go to their feet. It is very easy to put on and take off. The only thing I wish I could do is let them just sit on it and it would be a good thing for them to not have to do that. I would definitely recommend this product. This is the best dog bed I have found. It's lightweight and is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for the last 10 years. It's well made and the only thing that bothers me is the fact that it is a little hard to put on but that's not a problem with the other dog beds I have used. My dogs go to the bed when they're hungry and this one is a little bit tougher on them. This is the only catnip my cat doesn't like.

[again just do a google, you'll find them and they work hand in hand with the dvds].  Regarding the dvds: Leah will slay you dead - and the beautiful part is that just when you think your thighs can't take anymore, guess what: glute time! and then rinse and repeat. The sequencing is magical, and just enough work and holds for you it to make a difference. Leah Sarago knows what she's doing and the results are nothing you've never seen - because you actually DO see them  [please note: Leah does work the thighs a LOT - so if you are prone to ""bulking"" I strongly suggest you do a good 15 minute stretch everytime you use this dvd. It helps your muscles develop properly, especially your glutes, which you work a lot anyway].  Your heart rate will go up, your legs will look fantastic. There is are rotations available to get maximum results. Again, regardless of your age or size or time, this will do the trick.

1,"I was very disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins. to get off the phone. When I arrived in the room the bed wasn't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty. I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment(on the twelveth floor). Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong. When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean... There was hair all over the floor, toilet and shower. The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror. My allergies started to bother me, immediately upon entering the room, so I checked the filter in the air conditioner. Which looked like it had never been cleaned.The comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum. While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner. Which proved to be as bad as the rooms. The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy. The steak was rare and I asked for medium. Not to mention, it tasted like rotten meat.The veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry. To top the whole experience off... When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay."

The supporting cast is solid, and it's worth the watch.  Highly recommended.I was excited to see this movie.  The reviews said it was a great movie, and it was.  However, it is a little like the first one.  This movie has a lot of sex scenes, but it is not very realistic.  The sex scenes are very graphic, and the action scenes are very stupid.  I just didn't get it.  It is definitely a bad movie, but it's not that bad.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not a good movie.  I guess it's a good movie, but the acting is not good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.I really enjoyed the movie.  It's a funny movie.  I can't wait for the next one.  The acting is good.

My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!  So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.  PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS.

0,"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived."

I didn't want to pay Target's price, so I went to Amazon.com and found it cheaper here - so I ordered it.  This is the one and only awesome travel mug of all kinds!  The coffee stays hot for hours, it is truely ""leak proof"" - and I just can't say enough good things about this mug.  I purchased other kinds that say they are leak proof, and they were - but my coffee was luke warm within 20 minutes in my car.

From the moment I called to make my reservation, I knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. From the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the James, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. The rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. The walking distance to Michigan Av is a huge plus. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! And David Burke's Primehouse is not to be missed!"
0,"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash."
0,"I am a professional filmmaker and videographer. I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price. Worth every penny. Only buy NEW (used tape is not reliable) and be sure to buy the FIVE PACKS which offer the best deal for your money."

0,"I have to say, I got this book out of chance and have to put out there that I feel bad I hadn't known about this title before.  This story is basically a modern day Romeo and Juliet but that hype of Shakespeares' master work never wore the story down for me. Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person her and her family have known to despise, however, as the reader starts to grasp the power of love in this novel...it gives judgment a whole new meaning.  Mary E. Pearson knows what she's doing. I love the surprise, twist'n turns and the balance of drama, romance, and mystery in this novel. I'd recommend this to any young adult who are looking for that classic love story that we all love with a guarantee of a soft, exciting, original teen love romance. This book will have you appreciate and be more hopeful for that special person that you may or may not have come across in life.  Scribbler of Dreams is what every young adult needs."

0,"This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.  If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.  The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.  The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser."

0,"Even after thinking on it a while after I finished reading, I still have mixed feelings about this book.  The characters were likable, especially Cade, but there were parts of the story that just didn't work for me.  The main thing was some of the dialogue between Cade and Brook.  I hate to say it, but it was juvenile at times, and very repetitive.  As I said, I liked Cade.  I really felt bad for him, and the way he seemed to be led on my Brook, and just waiting around for her to make a decision that would effect their possible future together.  I did start liking the book more at the end, and was rooting for Cade and Brook to finally get their HEA.  The book was long, and not being completely invested in the story until close to the end, it took me longer than usual to read, so to get to the end and see that there would be another book?  I was pretty disappointed.  I still can't decide if I liked the story enough to want to see what happens next."

0,"I was intrigued by the story and it kept me going, but there were a couple problems with the writing. First off, I know a lot of people (ok not in the secret service), but I've never heard anyone talk like the female characters in this book. It feels like they had a photographic memory of a thesaurus when they speak and bring up ten cent words ever so often to let the reader know they're smart. And all the killing. I do believe there's some shady things that go on in this country, but I find it hard to believe all of those killings would happen under the radar. We have such a sensational media, they would be all over stuff like this! If you can get past those things, you have yourself a good read!"

1,"""Anatomy Of An Affair"" is a sweet, sweet, romantic story about love, loss, and the past.  The story is told from both Finn and Carrie's point of view, and is written in a way that leaves the reader feeling as though the characters are fully developed.  The characters are strong, likable, and likable.  There is a lot of angst and angst.  There are moments of anger, betrayal, and even forgiveness.  It's very refreshing to have a story that is about a man who has been hurt, and he has a chance to redeem himself.  The romance is sweet, and the story is not over.  The characters are likable, and the story is well written.  I loved the story and look forward to reading more from this author.I received an ARC"

However, when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only $10 more. That was great until I checked in. The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley. During the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley. It would seem that this is a place for them to congregate. On top of this, the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning. The noise was crazy loud. I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful."

0,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

0,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution. It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time. The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak. One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting. They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion. The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"

I ordered the XS size, it is a little bigger than I expected but not too tight. It's a good product and I'm very happy with it.I've had this bag for a few years now and it seems to be holding up well. It's very comfortable, looks great, is light weight, and holds up very well.  I haven't had it in a while but it's a good buy.I was a little worried about the quality, but it was just right for my son. I ordered the same size and I got the same size for my nephew. He has a small head, but I thought the length would be a little longer. I'm 5'2"" and the pants are a little snug. I ordered the Large because I normally wear a small and it fits great.  I'm 5'2"", so it's a little long on my son, but I'm sure he will be fine. He's usually a size 14, so I ordered a size up. He looks great with it, and I am pleased with the quality.I ordered the size 7 and it fit perfectly.  I think I will order a size down, but I will buy more.  The quality is nice.I love the way it looks and the price.  I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly"

The color is beautiful and the quality is amazing.  I wish it was a bit thicker, but it is a nice bed with a nice plush feel.  I wish it had a little more of a plush feel, but it is not as plush as I thought it would be.  I'm not sure if this is a good design, but I really like it.  I put it in a corner of the room where it is mostly used for decorative purposes, and it is very comfortable.

It's too thick to hold like a pen, so I hold it like a paring knife.  The LEDs shine in my eyes so I had to block them with masking tape (there's no on/off).  The locking button (for changing bits) sometimes gets pushed when I'm holding it, and it's inconvenient to increase the speed while I'm using it since the speed buttons are on the other end.  Otherwise it's very useful..."

0,"Some films that you used to love, just don't hold up. And this epic soap is one of them. In the acting department, Mercedes Mc. Cambrige walks away with the film, and Carol Baker is extremely effective. I so wanted to love this film all over again, but it's lost a lot of its magic. The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however. For me - I think I've watched it for the last time."
0,"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:  As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.  I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.  Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.  Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.  Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for. Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller."

1,"It's a shame that with this book, the movie version of it was also a disappointment.  The story is not very good.  There are some things you can't help but care about.  A little romance in the end, but no real depth or depth to the story.  I felt like the book was going to be a bit over the top with a lot of sex.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sex.I enjoyed this book, very much.  I have read all of the books by Will Eisner, and I was quite impressed with them all.  The book is short, and doesn't have a lot of action, but it is a good read for those who love a good mystery.  It's not a story of how it all started, but it's a great read.This is a book about a teen in the 60's.  It is a perfect addition to any library of books that you read.  I bought it for my grandson and he liked it.  I'm always looking for more of this type of books.  I would recommend this book to anyone.

The instructions are pretty clear and I just can't get over how awesome and easy it is to simply place the device in a cup of water. Growing up, we always had the huge R2D2-style contraptions posted up in our hallway during the winter months - given that it was in a house made sense but it was always a pain to refill. This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too. Once it's plugged in and you hit the power button, a nice, steady mist comes out.  I am just in love with Deneve products...they always seem to have fun stuff!"

0,"This is a reasonably entertaining book, though one needs to gloss over the often transparent plot and pretty one-dimensional characters.  The story line (prison world, alien technology with untapped potential, corrupt political system, rogue army general, a hero not fully aware of what he is, etc.) is not particularly original, but it hangs together and has no glaring holes even if how some of those holes are filled is at times not particularly credible or even meaningful."

0,"I bought this DVD for 5 bucks, and I still overpaid.  I wanted to like this movie!  It's a great premise.  It has Sam Jackson in it!  How bad can it be?  Well, the antidote to any potentially great movie is Bruce Willis.  He's no Kevin Costner now, I'll grant you that.  But he's very near the bottom in terms of acting ability.  In this flick, we're not really sure if he's mentally challenged or an adult or what. It's hard to tell since Willis seems that way in real life.  Not the sharpest tool, if you will.  His lack of acting chops ruins an otherwise great movie.  Hopefully, someone will do it again with a real lead actor who knows how to ... act."

0,"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun. After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still) The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there. Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.  *Disclaimer* I received this product at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

0,"This is an ambitious, grand sexual adventure set in Arthurian times. Ambitious because Arden takes on myth and has managed humbly to make them human. She doesn't sell out her characters in favor of spending valuable time describing or focusing on the universe, nor does she in ore it completely. I was astounded by Arden's fluency in historical detail, not to mention the authenticity of the gay male sex acts. She proves that any sex scene can be arousing to anyone regardless of orientation: the passion, hunger, and starved desire of any person makes something sexy and arousing."

0,"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...  Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!  -ONE LAST THING... Be sure to clean your gun before you fire it! -Mine had white styrofoam particles all over it and indside the barrel from the packaging. Just a friendly ""FYI""."
1,"Word A Round consists of a set of pieces, which are either left or right handed.  The pieces are not very detailed, but they are designed to be easy to take apart and assemble.  A little smaller than the size of a regular round, but still a fun toy for the little ones.  They love the fact that they can be attached to the pieces so they can take turns.  This is not a big deal for us, because it is a very simple toy that we have to play with.  The pieces are made of solid wood, so the kids can play with it, but we like that it doesn't fall apart when put together.  We love the fact that it is made of a soft material, and not of plastic.  I would recommend it for a 3 year old, but it is not for a 4 year old.  We just enjoy the fun of this toy.  It is very durable.  It does not break easily, but it is very easy to clean.  The price is right, and I would buy this again.  My son was very excited to get this for Christmas.  He is 5 and loves playing with it.

Granted, I've stayed at hotels of similar quality, but never have I paid so much for one of them! I could not believe what I saw when I walked into the room...it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall (that had been painted over).

0,"I mildly enjoyed Last Licks, but none of the subsequent books in this series have come up to the very first one -- The Big Kitty.  The charm of this book, and both of the other books in the series, are the sections where Shadow, the cat, is narrating.  Ms. Donally does know cats -- I will concede that.  She has not made Shadow a super, magical cat with human intelligence.  He's just a cat, with cat-like concerns about food, hunting, and female cats!  The mystery in Last Licks is so-so, and I wasn't sure about the culprit until the end.  But, character development is sadly lacking.  There isn't that spark between Sunny and her cop boyfriend that is so well done by Sofie Kelly in her Magical Cats mysteries.  Unless Ms. Donally picks up the pace, I don't think I will pay to read any more in this series."

0,"Great story about changing your life for the better!  This is a total different character set from Hustle Me, so reading order doesn't matter.  Many tears, lots of laughs, and the desire to kill the soon to be ex husband!  And now a bit about the story....  Ramsey has lost his family to a horrible accident and wishes he would have died with them.  Vessa has just found out her husband not only cheated again, but has been doing it since they got married and now he has some young woman pregnant.  After losing her temper for the last time, she withdrawals their money from the bank and moves it to another bank before heading to her aunt's house.  On the way she encounters a tractor trailer on its side and a collision follows.  When Ramsey gets called to the accident that mirrors the one that took his family he isn't sure he can handle it!  Enjoy as fate steps in to help these two move on.  Favorite passages:  - She told me that this life on earth was just a test for us to go to heaven. She said that the true at heart die young because they don't need to live the trial like others.  - This trip was about being able to forgive myself.  - With you by my side, each day hurts less than the one before it."

The clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me. Thinking room service would be better, I relaxed in my room while I waited for my food. By the time it reached my room, it was cold AND the wrong order. Disgusted, I went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance. All the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star, and none of my regular channels were on the tv. All in all, it was a bad stay at the James hotel in Chicago."

Bought the HDMI cable to view on my 50"" HDTV, very nice, I think the picture is as good as some of the HD shows on TV or even better. For the price, I feel the HDMI cable should come with it, but oh well what ya gonna do?  Camera is so light weight that it's hard for me to keep steady while walking, but then I'm a bit heavy and not so light on my feet. The access wheel on the LCD is a bit awkward but not bad once you get use to it. I always tend to spin it past where I want to be. Bought a Tiffen enhancing filter kit and man did it bring out the colors. Built in mic is so sensitive I can here myself breath and can hear the hard disk motor when very quiet, definitely need to get the Canon DM-50 mic.  Not sure which software suite to buy even though the software that comes with it is good enough to transfer video files and still images. Don't like the idea of having to plug in the charger each time I want to transfer files.  All in all I feel it is a great hard drive camera with nice features, however I should of waited another couple months for the new HF-10. Now that camera seems awesome, with basicly no moving parts and removable flash memory to transfer files, 12X optical and 30P - WOW !!  Next time !!"
0,"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.  A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.  Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.  All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost."

0,"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movies about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right?  There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. ""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. ""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play. Two other interesting tidbits about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman was Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter was Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein."

The sound is excellent, and I love that it can be turned on and off without having to turn it off manually.  I also like that the blades are reversible and that it is adjustable for the amount of air you want to use.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use, but I didn't want to pay more for this one.  I really like the fact that the blades come with a separate battery compartment for the fan, and the included battery compartment is great.

0,"Boggle is a great word game that is fun for the whole family in which players have three minutes to find as many connected words as they can in a 4x4 grid.  It doesn't take long to play (only three minutes to be exact) and you don't need a lot of space to play it.  It uses a lot of the same skills as scrabble, but unlike in scrabble you won't keep getting beaten every time by that brainy uncle who must have memorized the dictionary, because most of the words that can be found are only 3 or 4 letters long, and even younger kids have a fair chance to win(occasionally a very long word can be found however - my personal triumph was the 8-letter ""nicotine"").  Also, you WILL learn new words you never knew existed from this game when people guess them and make you look them up - crazy words like ""hie"" and ""tat"" and ""coe"".  Overall a very fun game well worth buying, although I wish they still made the bigger version, because that one's a lot of fun too."

0,"The Mega Fun 93628 Marble Fun Run has been a delight for my children to play with. This set has allowed them open ended play to build and discover for hours at a time. It's been fun watching them work and seeing them try to speed up or slow down their marbles to get to the bottom first. It's a good set to enhance problem solving skills, spatial reasoning, and so much more!  The set comes with 105 pieces and this includes 30 marbles. There are instructions to build the run on box, if so desired. The variety of pieces vary from curvy, straight, a loop de loop, starter areas with little levers, pieces that have detachable and re-attachable wheels, and more! Some of the pieces are translucent with sparkle and the rest are solid colors. The variety of colors this set is made up of makes it gender neutral. My son and daughter ages 7 and 4 years old have played with this set on their own as well as together.  This set is well made and the pieces stay together once hooked up together. I would suggest parents to put the little levers and tabs in the pieces they are meant for. My son tried to do this on his own and ended up breaking one of the pieces. With that being said, he tends to be a little rough on things. Other than that small mishap we've had no issues of the set showing wear or breaking easily.  I would certainly recommend this set. It's great for down-time during the afternoons or on days when the weather just too hot or rainy to enjoy outside. One thing I like is that more sets can be purchased to make an even bigger marble run!

It wasn't horrible, it just didn't suit me and the mood I was in, I guess. I enjoyed the female MC but the male MC didn't seem very original and there were a lot of the same sexual descriptions used in all of his chapters--especially about her butt. However, I would say the title suits the story--fast, crass, and angry."

0,"My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad, unfortunately, we would never stay in this hotel again. The rooms looked nice, but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink. The room service cost was super high - costing us over $100 for 1 burger, 1 order of french toast, 2 pops and 2 desserts. In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room (we were on the 5th floor, same as the reception desk). They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. The staff was friendly enough, but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. There was not even a coffee pot in the room. Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price. NOT worth it!"

0,"I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar..."

1,"My last Rottweiler, Jet, was a little too big for him.  We tried a variety of pet bedding and we had to get a larger one for him.  After a lot of research we decided to try this one.  We were skeptical about the size of the bedding but we were a bit surprised at how well it worked.  It's a bit big for him but it's just right.  It's a nice size for a large dog.  We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.  It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.  The material is very soft and it's easy to tear off.  I've used it on my dogs all over the house and it looks nice and it's a little big for them.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this bedding and I think it will last a long time."

0,"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips. I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips. Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily. but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them. the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone. Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves.

I like the fact that the compartment is made of an adjustable strap.  It's very easy to open and close the compartment.  The included pockets are nice and easy to store.  There's a small pouch that is a good size for water, but it's not big enough to hold a full bladder.  There's a small small pouch for air, but it's not huge enough to hold a full bladder.  It's very small for a small tent.  The tent is very spacious.  It has a wide opening for water.  There are two other compartments that can hold water.  The other compartment is just a smaller one that has a narrower opening that can be used for cooking.  The zipper is a nice feature that keeps the water out of the zipper."

The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.  Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.  They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.  One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.  This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.  Maybe that's a good thing...."

0,"I was looking for a nice casual dress that I could wear for the spring and summer and luckily the opportunity came along to try this one. I likes it so much that I immediately ordered another in red and I might even get another color. The dress fits me perfectly. I ordered mine in 3X. When I buy dresses similar to this style from Lane Bryant. I normally get the 18/20 size. The size chart of this dress list the 3X as suitable for 22W/24W. I guessed that the dress might run small... and in my case. I guessed right. I wanted some brighter colors and the teal is really pretty and the red is a very bright and vibrant. I like how light weight it is. It's very thin and that will keep me nice and cool especially in the summer heat. It's machine washable so I don't have to worry about a dry cleaning bill. You can add a scarf or nice jacket to jazz it up for the fall you could even add leggings and/or a long sleeved shirt underneath for wearing it in cooler weather. The only drawback is that the V-Neck plunges a bit too much, so I'll have to always wear a tank top underneath to keep my bra from showing. It's not too long either. It falls right above the top of my feet, so I can wear it with sandals or heels. I'm extremely happy with this garment and highly recommend it.  THE TEAL COLOR: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

0,"These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism."

Now I get perfect reception with absolutely zero interruptions!  Would recommend to anyone that has a place for mounting."

0,"This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.  There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.  The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.  The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!  FEATURES:   High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.  High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.  Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.  Auto switching on when detecting people coming  Operating temp :-20C-45C.  Sample provided for review."

There are 2 balls encased in the heavy nylon fabric, one is hollow and produces a squeaker noise that is loud and sounds like 3 different tones at once.

It's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them. I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. On a good note, the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. That's about the only good thing I can say about this place. I would not go back."
0,"If you're getting this thing to act as your primary screwdriver, you're going to be disappointed. It's not supposed to be an everyday replacement for your screwdriver. instead, this is the tool you chuck in your bag or car console so that, in a pinch, you have a screwdriver slightly better than on a multi-tool. The option of precision/normal in phillips/flathead is nice, too. Again, though, keep in mind that this is a pocket screwdriver, so if you subject it to frequent use and abuse, it's going to act like what it is: a relatively inexpensive pocket tool."

0,"Amos Gitai presents a brutally honest portrait of the human condition, no matter where it is lived, or when. ""Devarim"" is not about Israel, or Jews, or Martians. It's about the challenge of leading a decent life. That so many Israelis descend from Jews who were persecuted by Christians and Moslems for over a thousand years is part of the ""flavor"" of being Israeli. That, and the fact that Jews are one of the few remnants of the ancient world who retain their religious-mythological world and refer to it, consciously and instinctively, in every thought and action. ""Devarim"" is neither hopeful nor hopeless. It's just how things are. But in Israel, as opposed to France, German, Italy, etc. , what we see is not ""fancy."

This one slips regularly for me, but I do want to share that my Cannondale's handle bars are tapered, and it's challenging to keep any mount in place. It's still far better than mounting your Garmin Edge product on the handle bar stem. The Front Mounts provide much safer visibility during rides, where you need to keep your eyes on the road. For on our rough wine=country roads between Napa, Sonoma and Marin County roads, this mount slips dropping my Edge 1000 point straight down at my front tire. I've been using a third party solution that is much more reliable for me."

They don't have an in house gym, but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel, as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods. There are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott (they are building condos right behind it), but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago."

0,"The Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock D1000 is sleek, compact, and works very well.  Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on your desk.  The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.  The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.  The great thing about these USB docks versus the old school docks are that you can really place them anywhere and just hook it up to your computer with a USB cable.  This version is a winner.

At that point I had been too young to know the movie, aged by the time I was born, but when I saw it thought, wow, that's it.  With R Burton and E Taylor playing opposite, and caught on film, there was simply no reason to try it again.  I still wonder when anyone does.  These little devices are the same for line voltage connectors as Nichols and team were to Albee's play.  The technology has gone as far as it can.

He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not. That was the final straw for me."

Even the proper use of the English language was not a barrier for my daughters, to understand this play of the master, Shakespeare. The music was otherworldly, transporting the spirit, as the story came alive, weaving its magic before our eyes.   For me, this will be the role of a lifetime for Helen Mirren. She brought to life the gifted sorceress. Her acting was bold and powerful, and at the right moments, soft & tender. Her magical spirit Uriel was played to perfection by Ben Whishaw.   See this movie! You won't be disappointed, but be struck by its beauty and power, to lift your spirit also to soar."

Unfortunately I do not know which of the three cases I ordered on the same day is the right case but I've included photos of the lot number, expiration date & UPC code. The piece of rubber is stretchable, about 2"" long & about 1""-1 1/2"" wide, black, see pics. I just want others to be aware of this. There's nothing in the ingredients that should be the color black so I'd not use it if you see this also."

Spend a little more and get something better."
0,"Installed easily. Just plugged it into a USB port and Windows 7 recognized it. I should have stopped there. Instead, I installed the driver on the included mini-disk. The driver installed easily, but once it was installed, Skype no longer recognized it. I uninstalled the driver - no joy. I restored my computer to pre-driver installation, no joy. I tried installing the most recent driver from their web site. The installation never finished. I kept getting messages that Windows didn't recognized the publisher, and as soon as the progress bar was full, it started all over again. I tried uninstalling the updated driver and I got messages that something was already running, and it wouldn't uninstall. I have sent Ausdom an email asking for help, but I am returning it if I don't get an immediate, helpful response. My OS is Windows 7, and it is completely up to date.  Right now, it seems the only way to get this software off my system is to completely rebuild it, and I'm not looking forward to doing that."
0,"Mr. Barzun, has on page 739 attempted to define novels as opposed to tales. He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about ""detective tales"" seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a ""tale"", i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader."

0,"INVENTING GEORGE WASHINGTON:  AMERICA'S FOUNDER IN MYTH AND MEMORY is an interesting look into some of the many stories we've all heard about George Washington.  Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myths themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reasons behind their origination.  While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real sources of George Washington quotes and lore that Lengel exposes.  While some were innocent enough embellishments upon actual events or wholly made-up fiction, the reasons behind others are far from innocent.  Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the ends of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delves into the prevelance of the mythology in todays world.  Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writings directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myths retain their seeming veracity.  Whether taken from forged writings of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirers or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these stories in todays modern era--usually to serve modern political ends.  While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion as to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind:  Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify its sourcing.  As to the legends?  Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the hearts of his countrymen.""  I give this book FOUR STARS.  Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington.  Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for stories and qoutes being bandied about today!"

0,"The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best, and mediocre at worst. The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff. The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you. The room was lackluster, however. The bathroom was in especially bad shape. It was dirty when we arrived, with hair in the sink and shower. The shower was in really bad shape. The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low. The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit. The decor throughout the hotel (lobby, hallways and rooms) was very out-of-date and old-fashioned. I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well. The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use. The hotel's location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations. I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions, but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms, I might be inclined to stay there again. ...read more"

Christian Bale as an under the radar conman content with the small con being hustled by an overambitious FBI agent (Bradley Cooper), and Bale's partner in crime Amy Adams blurring their relationship with her own agenda. Mix with the political machinations of Jeremy Renner and Jennifer Lawrence as Bales mercurial wife, and it's a roller coaster ride full of punches and counterpunches with many laughs along the way. A fun ride and deserving of Oscar nominations."

0,"Seven-year-old Eric has always had an active imagination and a fascination with snow and cold weather. Initially, his father Ben doesn't think that his son's talk of a magical kingdom known as Lukana is anything more than a little boy's typical childhood imagination. Ben, himself, prefers the summer, while his late wife Jamie - Eric's mother - loved the winter. Jamie died giving birth to Eric, but her final act in life was to apologize to Ben.  Ben never knew exactly why Jamie apologized to him, although he vowed to himself that as his son grew, Eric would always be loved. Then, one winter day, Eric sculpts a snow owl in the backyard. With such a simple and childish act, Eric unwittingly sets in motion a series of events that cannot possibly be anything but magical. Now Ben faces the terrifying prospect of losing his only child to a wintry spirit...a spirit that just might be the boy's true father.  I must say that I chose this book because I liked the cover. I also enjoy reading fantasy, and was curious to see how the story would eventually pan out.

I'm almost 48 years old and I've been reading this series since high school. I have most of the books in paperback and as of the last couple years, on my kindle. I'm thinking about starting over reading them again. I can't even put into words how much I've enjoyed, over the last 3 decades, the Kinsey Millhone series. I would recommend this to everyone who likes a good detective or private eye series. I've laughed, cried, got mad, and felt a sense of happiness when the bad turned back to good.

It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.  Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.  I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.  The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.  As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts."

0,"I won't mince words: this book is a complete downer. The first half consists of Eileens diatribe, a scathing attack on her father, herself, her life. But the writing marks Ottessa Moshfegh as an author to watch.  Moshfegh gives us a thoroughly dislikeable narrator in the scrawny, shambolic shape of Eileen who has an unspeakable attitude, appalling habits and an entirely dysfunctional relationship with her alcoholic ex-cop father. They live in utter squalor in a town Eileen refers to only as X-ville. She works in the office of a local correctional facility for young male offenders and doesnt have a friend in the worlduntil one day Rebecca walks into the workplace. Beautiful, glamorous, confident  Rebecca is everything Eileen is not. But is Rebecca for real?  The ominous tone hanging over this story is compounded by the frequent phrases of foreboding generously scattered throughout. I have to say I'm not a fan of this device - it's rather too manipulative of the reader - and as is so often the case, the outcome doesn't quite live up to the suspense nor is the character of Rebecca satisfactorily explained. The book is by no means an easy read in terms of its seedy subject matter but it is, nevertheless, an interesting, fearless and thoughtful piece of work."

She had no issues with it.I was skeptical about the price but it was cheaper than the Petco stores. I was going to buy a medium but the dog is a rescue and the size is just right. I have a dog that is on a diet and a small dog so I have to be careful of my dog as they are too small for me.  I put this in a bag and it's a real good price.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have a large dog and a small dog.I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. My dog is a little hard on toys but she loves this toy. It's well made and the squeakers are loud. She's a very picky eater.My cats love this food. My dog is about 20 lbs. and he was very picky about it.  I would recommend this food to anyone with a picky dog. I give it to my cat twice a day"
0,I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups. The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.

I like that the toy is made from recycled materials.  It's made of sturdy plastic.  We also got a ""stiff"" plushie, but it's not that bad.  We've put it together to get it into a plushie and it's a good size for her.  She loves to dress up her little ones.  We'll see how she grows with the help of this.My son loves this toy.

0,"The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel. The carpet was exceptionally worn, wallpaper peeling, bathroom grout dingy. The place felt like it hadn't been redecorated in 30 years. On top of that, the windows would not open (not unusual for a hig-rise hotel), and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work, I have no idea (they said 'radient cooling' whatever that is), but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation. We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated. So much for privacy. I can't comment on the food, because we ate out at every chance. Chicago has some fantastic food! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location, near the waterfront and millenium park, shopping and dining. The conference facilities were average, but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent. I will never stay in this hotel again, especially for the price, because of the poor room quality."

0,"I bought one of these in large to try it out. The label was ""Urban Crews"". After washing it shrunk a little but was not a bad t-shirt for exercise (I like the extra length for stretching (no stomach shows)). I ordered another 2 shirts in XL Only ONE of the two were delivered. The label now said ""FWRD Denim Company"". It is a totally different type of material. Much cheaper and the make is also very cheap (not inexpensive...CHEAP). So it appears the quality of the shirt you get is VERY haphazard. Is it Urban Crews or some place they farmed it out to. The FWRD Denim Company shirt is made in Pakistan. It says it is 100% cotton just like the Urban Crew shirt but it does not absorb sweat like cotton. It just drips off like synthetic. I would NOT recommend these. You have no idea what you will get. I'm going to try a Duluth Trading Company long tail tee. They are $19.50, made in USA and much better quality."

1,"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is a Star Trek fan, and I'm not one of those people. But I am a Star Trek fan. The basic premise of the movie is that the crew of a space ship in the 21st century is infected by a virus that gives them the ability to control their own behavior. As they become infected, the crew become increasingly violent and insane. As the infected crew becomes more violent and insane, they become more violent and insane. The movie begins to get a little slow, but as it goes on, it becomes more realistic. The aliens seem to be having a blast, and it's kind of scary that they get on the ship and are able to control their behavior. It's a nice twist to the story. It's also a little hard to figure out who the good guys are. In the first movie, the bad guys were pretty bad. I guess this movie was trying to be a bit of a sci-fi horror movie, but it was a little too dark for me. I was hoping for a more more ""serious"" twist, but it just doesn't work. I don't think this movie is worth watching if you're a Trek fan. I would recommend it if you're a Trek fan. Also, if you're a Trek fan, you'll probably like the movie. This movie is a must see."
1,"If you want a 5-star hotel with 1-star service, make sure you book your next Chicago stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. When I checked in to the hotel, I had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line. I was greeted with no 'thank you for your patience,' or anything similar. The room was fine, but nothing too glamorous or outstanding. The internet cost $14.95/day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself. The thing that pushed me over the edge, however, was the valet parking. When I wanted my car in the morning, I had to wait 15 minutes to be acknowledged (the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether). And for this 'service' I was charged $51.00/night!!!! When I went to complain at the front desk, they just said that sometimes the valets get overwhelmed, and you have to exercise patience! I will exercise patience as I check out of this hotel!!!"

1,Paint leaks all over and looks like it's going to be a lot more difficult to get the shower head to work.

I have a shower head that I can't get on with a single hand. I have to get a new shower head to replace the old one because it's so much harder to get it to work.

0,"Let me start off by telling you that this story is not your typical romance story. Is it even possible to be able to find romance between an addict and a former addict ? In this story there are quite a few dark moments that have you holding your breath and praying and hoping for the best. What I loved about this story is that it provides you with the past and present time so you can fully understand what happened in Teagans life that got her to that moment. You start to understand Teagan more, or at least I did.  I thought this story was very well done. I could clearly picture everything in the story happening to someone and them going through all these motions and reading this story made it seem so real for me that for quite a few moments I would forget that it was just a story and it didn't happen in real life. This author has a way with words that get you to feel what the characters feel and are going through. It makes it seem so real that you just get lost in the book and suffer and rejoice with the characters in the book. That to me makes for a very good book and that is exactly what this book was. It was a very good book, even through its dark moments and because of its dark and raw moments in time"

0,"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work. The soles, glue, and stitching are all in fine shape even after all that abuse."

First off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour! Then when the bus finally came, the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel. Finally when we got to the hotel they didn;t seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room. (my wife and I stay in one room, our teenage girls usually stay in their own room.) So after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room. we would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left. They hotel did have a large occupancy rate, but that only slowed up everything else. our room service was late almost everytime we ordered, and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins. The quality of the room was fair enough, but it was almost impossible to get room service, we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days! We were suppose to stay for a week, we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at. I would not recommend this place to anyone! stay away!"

0,"I fell in love with King of Tokyo from the firs time I played. When I saw there was an expansion I ordered it immediately. The expansion offers a new monster and, at least to me, is awesome looking and fits in perfectly with the original monsters. Where the expansion really takes off though, is the evolution cards. It's not a huge addition in terms of changing the rules or how the game is played, but it does add a neat extra thing to try for every time your turn comes around. If you are a fan of King of Tokyo, King of Tokyo: Power Up! is for you!"

It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.

Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped. now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.  When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.  Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.  Do not hesitate - grab one of these units now before they realize it should be priced higher!!"
1,For years Natural Balance Dog Food has been the best in the business.  They have been one of the best in the world for our dog and she is a great eater.  Her favorite food is Natural Balance.  She eats a lot of them.  She has two very small dogs and a large dog.  I keep them in the refrigerator and on the counter so she doesn't get any upset.  I give them a fresh supply every day and they are very healthy.  They have been on my order for about a year now and they are still going strong.  I highly recommend it and will continue to buy them.  I would not buy this again.  I only give them one and they are not my dog's favorite food.  If I could give a 5 star rating it would be the best.This is a good product. My dogs love it and they can't get enough.Our dog loves them and is a good chewer.

This tool was recommended to me by a groomer and it works better for me then the Furminator and it is 1/3 of the price.  You do not have to press hard or tug, this glides smoothly and you will be amazed at the amount of hair that comes out.  My dog does not normally care for brushing but I have been able to get him to sit still longer and be *brushed* with this.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a longer hair dog that sheds alot. (plus my dog is mostly black so you see hair everywhere!)  Grooming him with this for just a few minutes a day has really cut down in the amount of hair I have to clean up all over the house from shedding."

0,"I haven't read the well regarded comic book (er, sorry, graphic novel), but this movie is terribly dull. The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be. Even the retro Victorian look seems uninspired. Overall, a huge disappointment."

Although not entirely spill proof which is why I only gave it 4 stars, the kids are neat enough to not create spills. I could see that being a problem for other kids however. Even with that, I would buy again and recommend as a good purchase for anyone looking for drinking covers for mason jars, which for us is our favorite cup for the kids.

Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore are superb in this intimate drama of two elderly people in a nursing home who become acquainted with one another through playing gin together. It was originally a play and it is a play on film. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys a good play on film.

0,"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only ""Jane Eyre."" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.  This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic ""A Room of One's Own."" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.  This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after ""Jane Eyre"", ""Shirley,"" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic ""Madame Bovary"" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.  One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.  The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.  This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.  This is simply a great read."

0,I love this blue version of the Petit BearGguy! I loved the mini one like this that came with the white BearGguy kit and when I saw them being sold separately in different colors I had to get them all. They are the same mold but each one comes with a jigsaw puzzle shaped base that connects with the others so you can form a combined base in a variety of configurations. Each one also comes with the attachment piece so any of the bigger BearGguy models can alternately hold hands (paws) with it if you want. Since they're all the same mold you can also swap pieces and make custom multicolor as well. Whether you use them as add-ons for other models or just want to display them alone they are really cute and very simple to build. You do not need to know Japanese to understand the instructions and these mini models would also make great starter kits for newbies just getting interested in gunpla.
1,"We stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful. First off, the staff is excellent. All of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile. The hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that Chicago has to offer. All of the shopping of Michigan Avenue was just steps from our room. We decided to go for the Shedd Aquarium package. We started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our 'all access pass' to the aquarium (very cool!). After our long days of sightseeing (and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar), it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant, but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city. To top it all off, they have the most incredible shower that I've ever used (and, even better, it's all 'green'). What more can I say? The Millennium Knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable. I highly recommend it!"

Years ago I was a regular reader of Dave Barry's syndicated column and gradually wearied of its seeming predictability. The novel format seems to have liberated his inner zaniness to good effect. The featured character, a dog, never fails to draw the kind of out-loud guffaws that make people look at you strangely if you're reading in a public place. The characters are dead-on caricatures of their South Florida counterparts, and Barry even manages, at the end of an entirely wacky plot, to create a page-turner tension as the ... oops, not going to drop a spoiler here.

Since I am an English teacher and have read nothing else by the author, I wasn't expecting ""great literature,"" but a satisfying, easy read along the lines of The Hunger Games (which I loved, but it's not literary genius or anything).  I say without hesitation that this book is a masterpiece that ranks right up there with Catcher in the Rye.  I was stunned at every turn in this book. There were so many opportunities for this author to take clich&eacute;d, easy roads, but he just never did.  The voices of the characters and the supporting characters were just brilliant. This book contains some of the best lines about life and death I've ever read while still maintaining the believable voice of a teenager.  I cannot say enough about how stunned I am about the brilliance of this author. I don't even want to read another book for a while! I know it would be disappointing!"

Since it is in downtown Chicago, that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night. My view also suffered. They had nicer rooms available with better views, but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! The room itself was decent, with clean linens and nice air conditioning, but I can get that in just about any hotel these days. There wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me, but for the price I paid for the room, I certainly had that expectation. It was a let down."

1,"So I gave this book a 4. 5 out of 5 stars. The premise of the story is that the two main characters are going to have a ""turning point"", that is, a chance to be together in a future. This is an excellent introduction to the world of a woman who is trying to save her mother and her baby from an abusive relationship."

0,"I received an ARC for an honest review.  Man, I gotta tell you, this is one of the best books I've read in a while. My heart ached for both Mackenzie and Theo and what they lost during those three years they were apart. You can feel the love between them, but circumstances kept them apart. I never saw the ending coming, there had to be a climax, but never expected anything like it. This is an amazing book that I'm recommending to everyone. Thanks for an amazing read."
0,This is a really cute movie. It can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Well worth the time and money to buy!
0,"I owned this movie as a child (purchased at Musicland in the basement of Westroads Mall Omaha, NE) and was excited to see it again but I must admit that I enjoyed the Japanese version better.  Despite the fact that the main character was dubbed by an Asian Actor (Keye Luke who portrayed Master Po on Kung Fu and was also the voice of the main characterin RODAN) it just seems to flow better and make more sense.  I also appreciate the original soundtrack for the film as it seems to fit the mood or tone of the film.  With special faetures and two different versions of the film I would say this is a bargain at twice the price.  So do yourself a favor and pick it up before it goes out of print."

0,"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...  Features 1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc. 3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc. Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan. Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.  I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!  I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. It in no way influenced my review of this product. If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button. It's nice to have the feedback  :)"
0,"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.  Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review. I was NOT required in any way to leave a positive review - I have rated and reviewed this product based purely on my experience with it; if in the future my opinion of it changes significantly, I will update the review to reflect that."
1,"They fit like a glove, and the quality is good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very large.  The only reason I give 4 stars is that the mesh flap is a bit short for the straps.  I ended up going with a longer one, and it is a little longer than I expected.  This is not a big deal for me, because I have a very small body,"

0,"I bought this chain because I was having some minor but persistent shifting problems with the other new chain that I had just installed. I noted that other reviewers had said that it improved their shifting, so I thought that it might help, and it seems to have done the trick. No mis-shifts or stuttering since I put this on after about 30 miles of test driving where I did up and down shifting frequently.  A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes. As others have noted it is 7.3 mm vs 7.1 , a tiny difference but trust me, you can't get a 7.1 missing link to work (I tried by accident)."

1,Elegant and modernized hotel with great staff. Location is wonderful. The health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout. I will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices.
0,"This hotel does not live up to the reviews. The room was larger than I expected. However, the decor was a bit dated. The bedding was ripped, carpet was stained, and the shower door was broken. There was a long wait to the elevators, and if you're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym. The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff. There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk. There are no ice machines in this building, so you have to request it from the front desk. One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person. 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice. I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait. I finally got the ice 10 minutes later. Two days later I requested ice again. Waited 30 minutes and just gave up. While I was leaving, I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said 'I didn't get a call for ice.' Well I obviously wasn't making it up, lady! I called and spoke with someone. She didn't even apologize or offer me anything. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. There are so many hotels in the Chicago area. Choose a different one."

0,"Growing up, there are certain stories that you are told are classics.  Your parents have read them, your teachers suggest them and all the critics continually laud them.  `The Swiss Family Robinson' is one of those books.  Just the very title causes one to take notice, and if you have ever read the book or happened to see the Disney film, you are taken to a lovely place of nostalgia whenever someone mentions it.  The great thing about books like this one is that these stories and the way they are shaped, molded and ultimately told are timeless.  Any age, sex or domination can and will enjoy this.  There are so many themes broached, but in a beautiful package that never feels overwhelming or too stuffed.  Everything feels relaxed and natural.  It is also a testament to real storytelling that the novel remains exciting and intriguing no matter how familiar you are with the story.  Settling in this past month to read this to my kids was a great way to relive the beauty and grace of this novel, watching it captivate them as well as me (new ears and old).  The language is fluid (which is not always so in these older classics) and the action is always present, even during seeming mundane situations.  My children were always intrigued, and I loved plowing through the chapters with them.  The lush imagery presented by Wyss is unforgettable and really a notch above most of what we have to read today.  There is truth in the idea that one cannot beat a classic, and `The Swiss Family Robinson' is a classic for a reason."

It is annoying when pointing at things, but not there when sliding for writing and sketching. I bought spare points in case they are not available in the future. So far so good and I am loving it.

0,"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function. But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails. btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.   I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical""."

We finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room. There is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by. My bathroom was disgusting and not to mention, very small. I did not have a very pleasant experience at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers."

1,"This movie is basically two people who are trying to make a living. One is a person who is self-conscious about the fact that his life is around him, and the other is a person who is afraid of him. Both of them have some kind of problem with the fact that they are a woman and have to do it because they can't work. I think that if you are a woman who has to deal with the fact that you have to work, then you will have to do something about it. You have to work, and you have to work, and you have to work. In the beginning, you are a woman and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work. You have to work, and you have to work.

1,"This Nerf gun is different than the original. It is a little bigger than the original and has a longer barrel. The gun is designed to fire the darts, so it is pretty straight forward. It is also a little more compact than the original. But it is not the Nerf gun that I was expecting. It is a Nerf gun that is really great. My kid will probably be able to shoot the darts from the front (as long as he can find his target). The Nerf gun is really nice and colorful. It is a very sturdy Nerf gun. I have used it a lot in my daycare. It is very soft and soft and well made. I can't wait to see how it goes. I am sure my kid will enjoy it. This is a good toy.

0,"Leigh develops the world surrounding music well, allowing those without the background to understand whats going on, while also not bogging down those who are already in the know.  The entire world is built in such a manner that you can easily follow the multiple different aspects of this well written novel.  Unfortunately I had a hard time fully getting into the story.  I enjoyed the characters in this novel.  Leigh has developed them in a multifaceted manner, allowing readers to get to know them on many levels.  There were times when I had a bit of difficulty merging them with their counterparts in the first novel of the series.  The major transformations and character shifts were a little drastic, but were also very well & easily explained by the current events surrounding the characters.  Although well written & enjoyable, I simply found this story difficult to fully get into.  I fully understand why others can & will thoroughly enjoy it, it wasn't my cup of tea.  Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."
0,"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.  There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.  I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders."

I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in both the social commentary and the political commentary.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little slow for me.  I found it hard to get into and a bit difficult to read the book.  I would have liked to see how the story developed and just how the author tried to keep it fresh.  I don't think I will be reading it again.  I hope the author continues to write more books.  I think I will buy this book again and maybe read more.

However, he didn't have to show every step, every time, too much repetition, wasted video time.  The production values are in the toilet, my  15 year old has produced better for youtube.

It is hard to get the pieces in the box. My daughter is still waiting for her first birthday party. She's a huge fan of the show and the kids love to play with it. I just wish there was more to it. Great. I like that the pieces are very small and have a nice twist. The smaller pieces are nice and easy to store. My 5 year old has found the smaller pieces are difficult to put together and not as sturdy. I would definitely buy this again. Very nice item. I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he was obsessed with it. It's very cool and sturdy and he loves it. We had to go back to the original and put the pieces back together. It was a little pricey for a 5 year old and the price was a lot lower than we paid for it. I don't know if it's a quality issue, but it's a nice little toy. This is a great card for all my kids to have in their deck. The colors are vibrant and my kids love them. I like that there is a lot of cards that can be played with. My daughter loves this little train set!  It's a good size for a little child to play with. My 2 year old daughter loves this train set. It's very easy to assemble. It's fun for little hands.

They have a bit of a ""sweet spot"" on the speaker base which is a nice touch.  The wire seems pretty weak.

After a few weeks of taking these pills she was not only up and about, but she was playing, jumping up into her cat tree, and cuddling with me on the couch. It was like night and day. I've had no problem with her or my other cat eating the food that the supplement is on. What I do is I put their food on a small dish, not bowl, squirt fish oil onto the food and then sprinkle the supplement as evenly as possible over their food. At first I was giving them the food in a bowl but would find a lot of the supplement laying on the bottom of the dish not eaten.

The body is too thin to accept anything else, e.g. a candelabra base flame bulb.  Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.  It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy."

The carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit, the room smelled of smoke (even though it's advertised as smoke-free) and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed! I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it.

I am looking forward to the next one. I loved this book!  I was so excited to see the movie, but I couldn't put it down. I was so sad to see the movie ending, but it was a nice ending for the book. I look forward to the next one. I really enjoyed this book and it was good, but I really didn't like the whole main character. She was just too mean for me. I don't know why I didn't like her. I mean I like her, but she was just too mean for me. I really really don't care for her, but I really did not like her. I really don't know why I didn't like her. I really didn't like her, but I really didn't like her."
0,"A LED light in the $5 to $7 range that works as well as this one has to be worth some kind of gold star. I replaced an 6 volt Xenon Lantern with one of these only it works better - much. I 100% totally don't understand the people spending huge amounts of time finding fault with a device like this and my reaction is - get a life. These things are flashlights or devices that I - a retired electronics engineer don't see how they can build at this price point much less how good and solid they really are and how well they actually work. Under no circumstances would I mount one on a Picatinny Rail Mount (even if it fit), or other life/death applications but - me I just need a flashlight. A good one that can save me from replacing expensive lantern batteries which this thing does superbly. The only problem is it's so darn small it gets lost real easy. if you can actually count that as a problem...."
1,"I mean. it's Klein. what more do you need?  Klein is a great brand for a reason!  I bought two of these to replace a defective switch in my shop, so it was a nice surprise. The original switch worked fine, but one of the two bulbs died within a couple of weeks. I ended up going back to the original switch and having to replace the second one. I went to Home Depot and found it to be too expensive and a good deal for the time it took to replace one of the bulbs. I returned it and ordered another one. When it arrived it was a little different. The switch has a tiny plastic cap attached to the bottom of the switch and the light is attached to the top of the switch. I had to carefully pull the cap off the light, but it was easy enough."

0,"I had high expectation of these boots considering they were #12 best selling men's shoes. I mainly wanted insulated boots that looked good.  These were NOT waterproof. I tested them by filling the bath tub with 2-3 inches of water and standing in these boots - within 20-30 seconds both the boots let the water in. I am not sure if I got defective boots OR they are supposed to be only waterproof in light rain / light snow kind of situations. I did the same test with my Timberland Gore-Tex hiking boots and they didn't let any water in - no matter how long I waited.  Also these boots are quite ugly - they are too wide for some reason.  I am going to return mine."
0,"I have used this one for 6 months now and have not had any problems with it.  The tuner picks up my digital channels very good.  Recording picture is great even in the LP mode. Stay away from the EP mode.  The only trouble I have had is with DL discs (Ritek), no problems with Verbatim DL.  There are some features that could be improved, but overall a great machine."
0,"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!  I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.  The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.  I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.  If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to."

0,"I came across this  book by accident and boy, am I glad I did.  It is a dark fantasy based on Nordic mythology, I think - but it did  not matter at all that I know next to nothing on the subject.  It felt like wandering in a situation, in the course of a walk in the wilderness - everything was normal but yet was not.  All apparently 'normal' protagonists had this underneath shadowy existence.  The pace was slow, like it happens in dreams but also just right.  Nothing was as it appeared at first.  A wonderful darkly joyous story.  Thank you Alex."

I found myself rooting for the characters and I loved how they got together and got their happily ever after.

1,"Mimi Leder's latest film, ""The African Girl"", is a film that will keep you riveted through the entire film.  The film is a must see for the whole family.  I highly recommend it.  It is a good film, and one I would watch again.The series was cancelled by a network in September, and it has been cancelled again.  I think the producers of this series just went with the idea that there was an on-going series that could have been better.  But I don't think the series has developed enough to make it worth watching.  This series is a great addition to any collection that includes the series.  This series is a must for any Star Trek fan.  If you don't own the series, this is a must for Star Trek fans.  This show is the best of the Star Trek series.  If you don't own the series, this is a must for Star Trek fans.This is a great story that is a great look at the life of a woman who was raised in the 60s, and who would be proud of her accomplishments.

1,"I could talk for at least an hour with my son about it. He loves the music and the other items.  The plastic parts are also very easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this toy to any kid.  Highly recommend.This is a great gift. The kids love it. It is a good size for them to carry around and it is a great size for a toddler. It does not have a lot of storage on it. It is well made and will last for years to come. You can change it up and out of the box, but it is a great addition to any party.I bought this for my 4 year old son who loves Lego and loves building things. He's got a lot of fun with this, and he likes to play with it constantly. He also loves putting the pieces together, and I'm happy to say that he's not quite finished yet.

0,I got this about a week ago. I hate cat litter. I hate how it smells and how it gets all over the floor. I feel like all I do is sweep up cat litter. I bought this to try it and so far it has been great. Schimschat took right to it. I just put it where his old litterbox was and we haven't had a problem yet. The poop is easily scooped up with the scooper and I can just flush it which makes the house smell better. I would highly recommend this product! You have to change the pads weekly and the litter monthly but it is totally worth it to me to not have to deal with the litter and the smell.

0,"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor. It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it! (dropped it to 4 stars for the way they cheapened the mounting compared to the original, but I AM happy with the net result)"
0,"Smaller than expected; as in photo, three kids can fit comfortably in it.  All ages love it.  No tools required to assemble.  Pieces lock in.  Nice sturdy plastic.  The sail area though is not meant to lean on.  While it is sturdy, it isn't indestructible.  Bottom of ship is open.  Kids like to push it around with one child on the top deck."

The story was well told, and the characters were well developed. This is a great series for adults and teens. I highly recommend it. I had to wait a year for this book to get published. This book is a must read for any young adult."

0,What's with this unmentioned cliffhanger crap??? I was lured in to read this free book but I will NOT be purchasing the other TWO books to get to a predictable end. What wasn't predictable from the description was that the H was going to be a dumb F.. Amnesia from an accident? After coming out of a coma the H researched EVERYONE to help know who they were EXCEPT the one his amnesiac mind should have and that's the clearly lunatic scammer of a fianc&eacute;. How do you totally lust for the h but treat her like crap on a stick but your supposed fianc&eacute; who know one likes and her character is more than questionable you allow to squander your billions but give her all the respect she doesn't deserve?? And again you failed to mention this crap was a CLIFFHANGER.... Sorry hunny.

I put some of this out and they didn't even touch it though some of them hadn't had much to eat that day.  It is also very very dry, the kitties will needs tons of water just to digest this stuff.  I also had this one in Venison/Buffalo, and they wouldn't even touch that one.  I think the neighborhood skunks and raccoons ended up eating it."

I keep 2 on my desk just for file transfer and to use for everyday tasks. Very easy to use and  all computers see them quickly and load them on command. The swivel lid is a nice option as well as I am always losing the caps. I have never had trouble with Kingston memory and will continue to purchase them from Amazon. Nice price, got here in 2 days, great product and great buy."

The size is perfect for my needs and is a great value for the money.  I have a Schlage T20 Spyderco on my garage door and this one is just perfect.  I installed the T20 Spyderco with a wire cutter and the motor was very easy to install.  The included hinge does not allow for sliding the motor out of the door frame, but it is easy enough to remove it.  The only thing I did not like is the locking mechanism and the door does not come off.  I have a large cabinet with a large garage door and this one is perfect.

I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV in place without having to pull it out of the case. I just put a piece of cardboard and tape it on top of the TV. I put the TV in a stand, and I put it in the back of my car. It's easy to put on and it's nice. I wish it had the built in bluetooth as well as a power button. I would have preferred to have the built in bluetooth option as well. I would recommend this for anyone who needs a small remote that has a power button on it.It's a good monitor and would be very useful for a photographer, but it is a bit of a pain to turn off the monitor when you're not using it."

There were too many confusing and unnecessary characters, which was distracting. This was an excellent read. I loved this book. I was hooked from the very beginning. I loved it.

I highly recommend this book to everyone!This was a great book. I love the fact that the characters were both strong and independent. I thought the author did a great job of bringing the characters together and getting them to fall in love. I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This is a great quick read. It is short but it has all the elements needed to get you into the story. It is well written and you will not be disappointed. It will keep you turning pages. This is a good book. It is short but it is full of great characters and a good storyline. This is the third book in the series, but I am not sure if I will read the other books in this series."

0,"I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks for doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.  There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edges of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.  This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.  This is a great whisk for smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably for many years."

So I had to attach it to the outside of his cage...which kind of defeated the purpose of his sleeping in it at night. But it is well made, and when he is out, he likes it. NOW if only they would make one with a roof, and string it on metal chain for hanging instead of rope I would be so HAPPY!"

The room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in (including the Four Seasons).

Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..  IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good.... Good day, Chief."

0,"Catalina needs to be in the mood to play, but when she is, this is one of her favorites, and I enjoy waving it in various ways, too!  Here's a tip: I noticed she was really chewing on the end, so I tied a knot there to discourage her from tearing it off and ingesting it.  Then the felt actually acquired a couple more knots from how quickly I was waving it over the next few days.  The knots add to the appeal, making a bit of noise and giving her something more substantial to catch and chew on!"

0,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.  I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.  You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.  Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.  I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.  Free sample provided for review."

0,"This was a really cute movie probably aimed at teens.  It was not meant to be high art, so I'm rating it for delivering a good job for what it was intended to be:  a cute and well written story about 3 nice and likeable Texas girls, mostly set in wonderful, romantic European settings, and just a lot of fun overall.  All three actresses were quite good and this was a nice afternoon escape film. It was nice to see a teen film that was pretty positive and wholesome for a change, not too old for its intended audience. I saw this in a theater mostly full of mid to late teen girls, and they all seemed to be enjoying it a lot."

Luckily, I haven't had a repeat of that day yet, but I'm confident that this horn is loud enough to grab any driver's attention.  I'm a little disappointed in the sound of the horn- it sounds like a really loud kid's toy horn. So, even though it's definitely loud enough for cars to hear, I wish it had a little deeper, more ""serious"" sound to it.  I also find it a little difficult to use it with my air pump- the floor pump's tube isn't long enough to reach it while it's mounted on the handlebar so I have to unmount it and unwind some of the horn's tubing to get it low enough."

It was great to learn that it was a little different in the end, but it was still enjoyable to read.  The first two books in the series were the most entertaining, and I loved the second book as well.  I just didn't care for the ending.  The story was all about the very first person POV, and I loved it.  The story was really interesting, and it was great to read about a little girl and her family.

In Esther Emery's lyrical _What Falls From the Sky_, she decides to turn off the Internet, turn off her cell phone, and start only using cash. It's an odd, lateral, and admittedly desperate move--but it ends up forcing her to face herself, her husband, her desires, and God again. Would that more of us would admit to our own desperation and seek any avenue to keep hope alive."

0,"The Bottoms Up was difficult for us, probably because of the 65 pound weight of our dog. I imagine it would be much easier with a smaller dog. Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either. We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up."

0,"Just returned from a one night stay at the Knickerbocker, and I will not return. It came nowhere near being worth the price I paid. Hotel Burnham is twice the hotel at half the price! The bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly. We had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered (which frankly may as well have been paper towels, nothing plush about them at all). We didn't have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered. Room service cart was left outside our door all night. All in all, it was a very disappointing stay.

0,"I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held. On the plus side, the hotel is reasonably well located, within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue. My room had a superb view out over the river. However, for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. The decor was dated, and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. The wifi is ridiculously expensive, and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. There was no wifi in the conference rooms, although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. I know Chicago is expensive, but for that price I feel the experience should have been better."
1,"Ben Affleck may be the most interesting part of the film.  He's a guy who has to be so damn good at making a movie that is worth watching, so he should be nominated for an Academy Award.  Affleck is a movie about a man who has to make a movie that is worth watching.  I think it's a great movie, but I've seen it several times.  This movie is a must see for any movie buff.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is into Affleck, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Affleck.  I've seen Affleck in a number of movies, and I've found his acting to be very convincing.  I was a huge fan of his in ""Berserkers"" and ""The Fountainhead"", so I thought it would be a good addition to my collection.  The movie starts off well with the story of a woman who is a woman who has a lot of power and how she chooses to act."

0,"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.  But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.  Best regards."
0,"It another one of those movies where twins are played by the same actor. This tired old trick was cute years ago with the Parent Trap. But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try. This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher. Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twins as the actors. Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and pretending to look at himself as a twin. This very old visual trick never works. You can tell when people do not make real eye contact with each other. This film might have even been interesting if they had used two different actors who look kind of alike. But overall it's not funny or full of action like Pinapple Express. Don't waste your time."

0,"""It is the place that confronts me with the fact that truly accepting love, forgiveness, and healing is often much harder than giving it""  The story of the prodigal son is one of the most prominent parables Jesus tells in the Gospels. A young man rejects his father, takes his inheritance, and foolishly spends it. The son finally decides to return home hoping that his father will forgive him and accept him back as servant. Unexpectedly the father doesn't even wait for an apology. The father runs out to his son and throws him a huge banquet.  This parable is both comforting and infuriating. It's comforting to see the unconditional love of the father, yet infuriating that the father doesn't ask for an apology or make him work back his favor.  A lot of Christians today live in this paradox. They love the unconditional love of God but are irritated when God shows so much love and mercy towards our enemies. We even do not like to accept undeserved grace. Legalism is born from this idea that we must earn back God's favor and fortune. ""One of the greatest challenges of the spiritual life is to receive God's forgiveness."" Our hearts need not to be focused on searching for God or loving God more. We need to allow God to love us.  Nouwen spins the parable a bit in this book. We always look at where fit between the sons: are we the lost son that returns or the stubborn brother that doesn't love? Nouwen challenges us to think about the father. Yes, in the parable the role of the father is the Lord, but God commands us to be like Him. Are you capable of loving like the father? Accepting and forgiving without an apology?"

0,"This is a fun and innovative toy that gets kids outside and exploring nature. My 6 year old had so much fun peeking around trees to see what he could find in the woods. He even had fun pretending that he was looking for Big Foot. The handles are very easy to hold, and the periscope is light weight making it easy to bring on a nature walk or hike. My 3 year old even had a blast playing with it. The periscope can be used inside as well to peek behind couches and ""spy"" on siblings or parents. That makes it a great toy for sunny AND rainy days! The light makes it fun to explore at night too so this would be a great toy to bring on a camping trip! This periscope is also durable which is a must when being used by little ones!

0,"The author has been an English teacher in Chile since 2001. He gives the inside story about teaching English in Chile by connecting his own personal knowledge of how English teaching has been developing in Chile over the past 14 years. The results of four international tests have never been wonderful, but the inside story is that English in Chile is changing the way it teaches English. The author argues that Chile could produce its own National English test, with four skills, give that test every 3 years, and have better test data to fine tune the way English is taught in Chile. I like the way he understands that the test results need to be understood as a way to keep improving teaching. It is a fascinating book for anybody who is interested in teaching or learning English."

I had to get a little crafty mounting the tweeters in the stock locations but they worked out.  As far as sound goes the highs will make your ears bleed, mids are very nice, vocals and live music sound nice. I'd say if you like to hear quality in your music these will do that but if you like hard rock,rap or anything with needed bass response look elsewhere. I paired these with the 6-1/2 model of these in the rear side panels and I can say they are better rounded and have tons more fuller sound. I'm thinking of replacing these with them in the front as well. They are good filler speakers to me but wish they had more punch. Pushing them with 100 watts out of a fosgate amp. Very good but not great"

I can't say exactly how long as I was lost in the story which I just read straight through from beginning to end. It's a very contemporary story which starts on an ordinary Saturday when Liz, the protagonist, finds her world collapsing around her. The opening of the book is starkly poignant as Liz tries to cope but what happens next is completely unexpected. I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the story but I'm amazed at how the author shifts the direction of the story so completely. The writing style is easy to read but the clever choice of detail provides a full and rich background which makes it feel like a much longer book. There's some lovely descriptive writing in Message in a Bottle. The landscape and the flotsam and jetsam of the beach walks stand out along with the exploration of Liz's emotional state as the story unfolds. A real gem of a story, beautifully written and highly recommended."

0,"The seat is easy to install and aesthetically pleasing. Toddler seat is stable. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seat is very flat. There is no rise or ""horn"" in the front. When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their privates are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chances of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high. My recommendation to the company is to add a contoured toddler seat. This seat is probably best used with an older toddler who understands the concept of being over the hole with no guidance from a contoured seat. We're returning ours."

0,I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.

0,"UPDATE: I believe this vacuum is now going on 4 years old and still works like a champ. Had to replace the filter twice in that timeframe, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Probably go on for another 4 years.  I'll keep it short:  No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.  We did a side by side comparison of another upright vacuum, and this pulled more dirt and more pet hair out of the carpet than the other one.  Not by a little bit, but by a huge amount.  I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.  I hope this lasts 15 more years, because I never want to use another vacuum.  Oh, I did have to go out and buy a bristle brush attachment."

0,"Once an architectural historian, I have a weakness for books about architecture and/or renovation projects. So I had great hopes until I started reading this one. It was quickly apparent that the author knew very little about buying, renovating or even owning such a building, and since that was the scaffolding on which the story was to be told, the book lost my interest. There are good architecture books, by, for example, Lindsey Davis (a Roman villa in Britain) and Ellis Peters (a great cathedral). This isn't one of them."

0,"I remember the 12 inch Indiana Jones doll back in 1981 that was out for about a week, it seemed anyway. It was imposable to find then and I have been waiting for it for years! (Because I wouldn't pay the ridiculous price for it as time went by). Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down. Does anyone at Hasbro have the slightest clue how useless this feature is? It's a minor nuisance and overall it's worth owning though other companies are now making much better detailed versions of Indiana Jones in 12"" form."
0,"I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day."
0,"I started out excitedly reading this novel but soon lost interest.  In fact, it took me several months to finally finish it.  I felt the author treated the main characters like cardboard cutouts:  there was no real life to them and they acted very stereotypically.  Also, I thought that the plot would jerk forward at times leaving out important details.  Finally, the plot seemed too far-fetched to have happened in the deep south.  Would a plantation owner's daughter really have been a slave runner and married a Native American man?  And after William killed Thomas with an arrow I do not think that he would have remained alive.  Other plantation owners would have hunted him down and killed him in real life, I believe."

1,"I have to admit that I have never read a book that didn't make me laugh out loud.  I had to read a few chapters in the beginning of the book, and that was a huge relief.  I'm a huge fan of James Patterson, and I had never read anything like this before.  I read it several years ago and it was a great read.  I just can't get enough of the characters and their lives.  It's very refreshing to have a book that is so original, so well written, and so unique.  I read a few of the other reviews of this book, and it's hard to say that I did not like it.  It's a bit of a letdown.  It's a bit of a letdown.  But, I liked it.  It's about a teen girl who is trying to figure out who she is and who she will be.

1,"Our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and, instead of helping, a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us. They had trouble locating our reservation. Our room was tiny! When I'm paying over $400 a night for a room, I expect to be able to walk around in it! The beds were also tiny. The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door. This hotel was probably once beautiful and classy, but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs. Won't be staying here again."

0,"Because the author gave me a copy of her book to review, Amazon will not say verified purchase. I started off reading this novel kind of slow, as I myself am also an author. I found this book from the fourth page on to be written with charm. On every page, there is a twist and turn that seems like it would really happen in real life. One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house. I could relate to growing up with houses that I thought were haunted and I remember going in them and running out because I was so scared. Eventually, everyone has to face something that they are not willing to. It'sa good read and I think anyone reading it will enjoy it."

I would recommend this to anyone. I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. She's a size 8 so I ordered a 9. 5. She's a size 6 and they fit perfectly!Love these shoes!  They are very comfortable, very soft, and have a really nice feel to them. I wear them every day, and have worn them all day long. I can't say enough good things about these shoes. They're a great addition to any wardrobe, and they are a good fit and quality. I can't wait to wear them for a long time. Love these shoes. I love the color and the fit. This is my second pair of these, and I really like them. The material is good, but the sole is a little loose. The color is exactly as I expected. It's not as warm as the picture would suggest, but it's still nice. The heel is a little loose on me, but not a problem. The color is a little darker than the picture suggests, but that's okay because it's not too dark. It's a very nice shoe. The quality is nice."

0,In from Minneapolis and was hoping to stay on Michigan Ave at hotel. When we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room. The hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than desireable location. Management on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave. They gave us $15 for cab fare. Will never stay there again. Happened to numerous guests the same weekend.

0,"The earbuds are of very good quality, producing very good sound even at high levels. They are comfortable in use. Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed. They fit very nicely in my ears under my helmet. And for a very few dollars instead of $100 and up."

0,"Party of Three: Sunday Night Dinner Club book 1 by Jess Dee is the beginning of a new series and what a terrific start. I loved the main characters of Spencer, Chelsea and Levi, but I actually found myself a bit torn at first on whether I wanted all three of them together. I adored Spencer right from the start, maybe it had something to do with him being an Accountant, lol :) Of course, that soon passed as I love when best friends share the same woman. The sex scenes were scorching hot and I enjoyed the fact that Spencer and Levi were able to discuss their feelings for Chelsea with each other. I also liked that this story introduced secondary characters who are long-time friends and I loved the close friendship that was portrayed and the fun bantering. I am really looking forward to all the stories in this series."

If Holiday Inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the Knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. The location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in Victorian mansions. For the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown Chicago."

We checked the closed with the mini bar (picture uploaded), so much dust, nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years. We called in housekeeping, giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it. Still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs. later. Next day moved to a renovated room, much better but not 5 star clean at all. In addition, there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception, no wonder when just 1/3 of the counters is actually open. Please do something about these issues its ruining everything!"

Battery-operated Chewie flies the Millennium Falcon around, and you use your paddle to knock him away from your stormtroopers (and into your opponents' stormtroopers). Last one to have troopers remaining wins.  This sounds like a silly game, but is surprisingly addictive and is fun for both adults and children."
0,"I am impressed with the quality and durability of these cat toys. I bought the first one, single speed, then this one with variable speeds. They both have features I like and also things I think could be improved, but they don't shut themselves off every time the cat stops it like some do (a good thing!), and its very quiet except for an enticing little sound it makes sometimes, kind of like a squirrel chirping only not that loud. I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off. My cats tend to do a lot of watching and some active playing with them. At least it keeps them occupied some of the time!"

They are beautiful with the silver embellishments and the leather is nice, but not the foot area or bottom.  I wanted these so badly, but they aren't made for me."
0,"Although these can hardly be called ""shorties"" -- they hit mid-thigh -- they are definitely comfortable ""smoothers.""  I can wear mine all day, and I only occasionally remember that I'm wearing them.  A medium fits a pants size 8-10.  I was a little surprised to see how sheer these are, without any seams at the bottom.  But the lack of hem is a great idea since no one can see the line where the shapewear ends.  (If you buy too small, you might see a difference between the compressed area and your thigh.)  Because they are so sheer, the amount of control is light, but the smoothing factor is strong.  Especially under tight or stretchy pants, these smooth out bumps nicely.  Yeah, they don't work miracles, but they can make your body look sleeker than it is.  I'm always concerned that shapewear, particularly the kind that targets thighs, will ride up.  On a full, 16-hour day of wearing the shorty shapewear,  this might happen two or three times at most, and it's never so bad that it's uncomfortable or visible.  I never feel the pinch at my waist that I had with another brand that I tried.  Perhaps because these offer moderate control -- as opposed to full-on squeezing -- they are the most comfortable shapewear I've worn.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
0,"I've never been a big Swiss Army knife fan, primarily because of all the ridiculous ""tools"" that get included with so many of them (a corkscrew? Really? Like I'm opening a bottle of wine on my camping trip...) but also because of the bulk that these tools create. This one changed my mind, I love this thing. It's well made, feels great in hand, has USEFUL tools with no frills and all in a profile I can actually keep in my pocket without creating a ridiculous looking bulge. I also REALLY love that the blade and the large flat screwdriver have liner locks. I've owned other Victorinox models that I found myself staying away from because the lack of a lock created dangerous use conditions. And let's be honest, the fact that the German Military chose this as their standard issue says a lot."

She wants to go home but has no idea where that might be.  As she starts driving she sees a highway sign that she thinks looks familiar so she turns on to it in the direction that she thinks might take her home.  After hours of driving she pulls up to a house she thinks is her home and knocks on the door.  The door is opened by her shocked husband and finds out shes been gone for seven months and has no memory of where shes been or why.  The next day she tells her husband that she wants to retrace her route to see where shes been and why. Now things really get strange but interesting. Its a really good plot and worth reading.

0,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.  Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.  Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."

1,"Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.  - Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap. - Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head. - Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.  I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.  One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea"

0,"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.  To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.  The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.  When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand."

1,"Before i start the review, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who has provided their feedback. I had a lot of feedback from people that had not had a chance to use it yet. It was a little difficult to use for my comfort level, but once I got used to it, I was impressed. I had to work on my breathing so I could get more comfortable breathing. I am 5'8"" and I have a size 10 waist. I have had trouble breathing on the floor because I am too small for my legs. This is a great feature and a great product. I have been using it for a few months now and I am still happy with it. I hope this helps to explain my review. I will update this review once i have the opportunity to use it. I would recommend this product to anyone. I really like these gloves. I have had a few pairs of these in the past and they are very comfortable and good quality."

(And I ain't complainin'!)  I use it with my Kindle Paperwhite (2014). The fit isn't perfect, as it is designed for the Fire, but it works just fine. Inside there is a tab in each of the corners to hold down the tablet. Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around. But only just barely, and since it ships with a styrofoam insert (to keep its shape during shipping), I use that for extra protection and it works great. So I definitely recommend this for other Kindle Paperwhite (or equivalent-sized e-reader) owners."

0,I received a pair of goggles at a discounted price for this review but the opinion expressed is all mine. The quality of these goggle is very good. The come with changeable nose pieces so you can find your perfect fit. The hold is very tight so they will not leak. You don't have to press very hard for them to suction on. The strap is easily adjusted so you don't have to fight with it. It has a wide range of sizes so it should fit most perfectly. A huge plus is they come with UV protection because keeping your eyes protected is very important. The storage case has drainage vents at the bottom so you can just place them in the protective case after use. I would purchase these goggles again.
0,"I  always have a throw covering my couch cushions because my dog sleeps there when I  am at work. However, it not only has to protect, it also has to look nice. This one does both admirably.

0,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.  The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.  At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.  In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)  That's... really... bad script writing! You almost have to admire it!"

The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed, and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. The food is good, location is great, everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here."
0,I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and fair review of the item and I have found myself to be very happy with my purchase.
0,"If you like The Hobbit films, you owe it to yourself to get the Extended Edition.  Even though Steve Jackson did not give us as much extra material in the Hobbit films as he did in the Extended LOTR, the Extended Battle of Five Armies has substantially more material than the theatrical edition.  It also ties up some loose ends that exist in the theatrical film.  For people who like short, simple films, this entire series is too long.  For people who love Tolkien, and understand why a film cannot be the same as a book, it is too short.  Recommended."

0,"I love the concept. I found some of the stories more engaging than others. The problem with short stories is that there's sometimes not enough time to care about the characters and really feel their despair and visceral urge for revenge. ""Until Death Do Us Part"" was most effective, because everybody can empathize with a bride on her wedding day. The BPD reception was something I'll never forget! Probably everyone can relate to the road rage sketch and will enjoy living vicariously (and laughing in shock) through the fantasy. ""The Proposal"" was a little too long--the least satisfying and most boring of the tales. Revolved mostly around greed and entitlement, which don't interest me. ""Pasternak"" was interesting but too unlikely to make a serious impact (no pun intended). ""Rats"" was pretty good. The one about the demolition guy was okay. Honestly, I might give this 3.5 stars. But I'm not at all sorry I rented it."

0,"The vast majority of international terrorism conducted on a spectacular scale is State-sponsored. A faction or network of government uses its access to the levers of power to promote actions in various ways. As withe the Red Brigades the Baader-Meinhof faction showed their gullibility because both groups were created by and controlled by NATO intelligence. Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly. In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted. Two other celebrated signature cases are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang  protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof was acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6. Putting this as a backdrop the the film increases its importance significantly and allows the viewer to connect the missing dots."

0,"I purchased a system from Lorex and when I opened the box, it was missing parts, so Lorex said that I had to purchase $50 worth of parts (power cord, remote control & mouse) to make it work. Yes... those items should have been in the box (as stated on the box). After buying the parts and plugging it into an outlet, it did not work. Lorex does not want to replace or refund it. I have been fighting with Lorex for over a year about this. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a system that I installed and had working in just a few minutes. Save your time & money, go to Wal-Mart and get a different system (not made by Lorex). I wish that someone would have warned me about Lorex and they way they treat customers.  Also, if you have a problem with Lorex products, you are told to submit a (claim) ticket on-line. After they can't or better yet ""won't"" help, they cancel your ticket and if you want to continue to fight them, you have to submit another ticket.

0,"Pretty silly cat toy, silly as in pointless. Concept is great, so I listened to the 5 star reviews and asked for this as a gift. From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless. My super playful kitten (loooooves chasing the ""red dot""), tried to chase it for a minute or two, but after a while got bored with the movement and just abandoned the thing."

0,"I am not much of a complainer, as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site, but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago: My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006. The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone. The receptionist was outright rude, but took the reservation without a mistake. During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent, the waiters, the managers, nobody was friendly, nor tied to accommodate us. [------------------------] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour's party. The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions. When we returned from the reception at 11:50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. 'Nobody told us, we can't do anything for you.' 'Are you sure that you arranged this?' Two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again. I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]"

0,"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights. Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this. Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use. Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down. Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.  I want to note that the vendor I bought from (they sell through Amazon, so this is appropriate to mention), The Best Things, is a good company and I would not hesitate to give them my business.  But I cannot recommend the Nobex saw."

0,"Read some of the reviews written by the experts. They say it so much more eloquently and succinctly than I can. The ending is surprising, but also very sad. I look forward to the next Inspector Rutledge novel in this series. One of the professional reviewers used the word ""craftily"" written to describe the authors style. All I can say is craftily enough to keep me turning pages until the very end.

1,"I traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. The service truly is incredible. They even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after. The rooms really rock (pardon the pun). Nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. The easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets."

0,"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.  This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).  I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own."" This was a piece of television history when T.V. wasn't loaded down with reality shows and poor shows. Get this show on DVD, you won't be disapointed."

What a fun love story this is!! Thinking her ""love"" life is done and over, Jordon isn't ready for her reaction to Blake. Upon meeting him she is rude and outright mean to him. It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself. Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons. The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call. I really loved all the characters in this book. His parents, Dacy her BFF.

Not perfect, but a real improvement - this old furniture is presentable.  Next up is the carpet at the top of the stairs.  Minor spots and stains, but not as much ground-in dirt.

1,"My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month. We were celebrating our anniversary, so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite. According to the website, we were to be given either a city or park view, neither of which we had. Instead, our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. The woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient, and the man who helped with our bags was the same. When we got to the room, the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming. The bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink. My husband requested that we be given another room, preferably a clean one, but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. If given the chance, I would not stay at this hotel again, even if I were offered a free night."

1,"Lineup by Liad Shoham is a fun, entertaining, and engrossing read. I was particularly impressed with the writing style and the characters.  The story itself is interesting, and it's worth the read.  Highly recommended.I enjoyed this book. I don't know how I would recommend it to anyone but I will say that I had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I did not like the fact that it ended a little slow. I don't like the ending, but I will say that I enjoyed it.  I think it was a little too predictable and predictable. I really liked the characters, and I found that the main character was very likable. I was a bit disappointed with the ending, but I think I enjoyed it a lot. I also liked that the ending was not the same as the book. I think the ending was a little abrupt, but that's just my opinion. I enjoyed the book a lot.I'm not a fan of the YA books, but this one was amazing.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to read and enjoy the language.  I loved it.

I had terrible service from the moment I walked in the doors. I was not greeted by the receptionist, it was like I wasn't even there. My room was NOT ready for me when I got there, even though I got there AFTER my required check-in time, then once I was allowed to go to my room, it was filthy! It was as if they didn't even clean it, so I don't know what the hold up was. There were no towels, shampoo or soap in the bathroom. The worst part was that there were bugs in the tub! The place was the most disgusting place I've ever been to, and it is supposed to be one of the nicest! It should be the nicest for the price they charge. I do not recommend staying here!

I also really like the coloration. I've seen photos taken with the Baeder film (which produces a white image) wherein the photographers used software to add some yellow color to their images. in the end, their images looked just like what you see through this black polymer.

The one on the south side probably lasts the whole night (checked a couple of times, was very bright around midnight).  It stays on for a shorter amount of time if it's cloudy/rainy/snowy.

0,"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.  The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.  The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.  This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.  You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.  Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.  BTW, I've got over 30 years of plumbing experience, so please don't take what I say with to many grains of salt. I am speaking from extensive experience. Good luck with your project..."

0,"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed. If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing. If anything I hope this will turn a few people on to the lovely music of Chet Baker."

0,"I wear an 8. 5 or 9 and a 39 was way too small. The Makenna style seemed to run a bit more narrow than the regular Dansko clogs that I'm use to. In the photo, I really liked the wide strap, but it seemed bulky for me at the ankle and less dressy than I thought they'd be when I tried them on. In the end, I preferred the narrower strap and the width of the clog style Marcella Dansko and chose a 40 rather than a 39. (I have 4 pairs of Danskos which have lasted for 10 years and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes."

Anyway, the stick works really well but doesn't last long as I had to constantly apply it even during the middle of ripping. Need to buy couple more sticks - use about 3"" of the stick after ripping about 600 feet of oak. An additional benefit seems like sawdust doesn't collect on the tires. Looks like the stick will save both tires and saw blade."

(I've paid more to stay at the Santa Barbara Motel 6!!) Gorgeous hotel, great staff, fun bar/lounge area and we were most impressed with the room. The large windows in the bathroom were the best--I took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of Navy Pier and the skyline. I remember thinking, 'This is really living...' The room was comfortable and quiet, again with great views just like in the bathroom. Chicago is a wonderful town--I have nothing but good things to say about it. CAn't wait to come back!"

0,"This is SO entertaining!  Great soundtrack, especially put together & recorded at the time the movie was released, the lilting tuns keep things moving right along.  Colleen Moore is at the peak of her (considerable) power in this confection.  We watch a lot of stuff on Netflix, but sadly they don't feature things like this...so thankfully it is readily available here."
0,"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done. Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels. Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done."
0,"Your mileage may vary... The 1st two orders were great. Pate, like anyone would find for their cat or dog.  HOWEVER, my last batch was itchy, gooey, and gross.  My cats still eat the crud, but now with them having to clean their tongue of the gooey mess it is.  I JUST ORDERED 2 NEW CASES, so if they are like the last batch. They are going back to Amazon because of crap quality control.  I gave this product 5 stars earlier, however, their last product sucked!!!  To sum it up... Great ingredients, and great for your cats. But how about not making it gooey stinking goop?  You need better quality control. My cats are about to give up on this food because it comes out as goo. I've even put it in the refrigerator, and it's still the same goop.  I will post later, and if I got the same goop as before.... I'm sending it back.  SHAME ON YOU ""NATURAL BALANCE""!!!!  If these cans are bad, you'll never have my business again!!!"

0,We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year's in 2008 just to get away for a few days. We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap. So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again. It also included parking at the great price. Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago. Best location to walk EVERYWHERE. My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows. Can't wait to go back.

I look forward to reading more from this author. This was an excellent read. The characters were strong, likable, and the story line was great. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, steamy read. I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine. The story is very well written and I enjoyed the story. This book is a great read. A good read, especially for a weekend. I found it a bit difficult to put down and enjoy the whole series. I loved this story. It was a good read and I was able to find out the ending of the story. I hope to see more of this author. I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick read."

0,"I quite enjoyed this book, and not just because I like food, or am a fan of Ramsay (I confess to both). As a small shop owner, I found much information in this book useful even though I am not a restauranteur, and have referred to it often over the past year and some months I've had it. I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feels their business is in a bit of a rut. I can't say you will find direct examples, but if you keep your mind open you'll see the larger points he is making re: business. It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business, including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.  The only reason my review is not 5 stars is that it does repeat itself a bit at the end. This is also the fault of a great many business books, most of which do this to a much greater degree."
0,"I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. Unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel. First off, it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of Gap, Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, Hermes of Paris (which warrants a separate mention). I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. I definitely love the room. While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my Herve and Louboutins in. My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. I mean, seriously. They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say, a 3000-room Vegas hotel. First, I called in to reconfirm my reservation. The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. First off, she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom I had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM. As a general rule, I am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. Think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. I placed an order of chicken BLT, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). The bread looked like someone stomped on it, the L and T looked like it was 2 days old, the B was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. It was pathetic room service at its finest. We did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. We won't be coming back, unfortunately."

0,"This little caterpillar is one of the cutest toys we own, and is perfect for my 7 month with room for him to grow along with it. For now, he pushes the caterpillar along the floor, or plays with each of the individual segments if I pull them apart for him. Each of the pieces includes an individual experience for play, with rattles, spinners, and different sounds. My 7 month old loves to tap the pieces together when he has one in each hand. He's also figured out how to push the red heart to get music and blinking lights. My 2 year old loves to build the caterpillar by himself and sings along to the familiar music (Polly Put the Kettle On). A hit with both of my boys, and not an ""annoying"" toy for me to have to listen to. A win for everyone. 5 stars."

0,'REMEMBER' is superb filmmaking.  Christopher Plummer is remarkable and we are fortunate that he was cast in this film and in this role.  This movie is what great filmmaking is all about.  Great screenplay and direction.  Don't want to give away any of the plot because I feel it will give away too much and spoil the excitement of the film.  It's the best film I've seen in quite a long time.

1,"Precise and palpable details present the real problems with the third book in the series. I was not expecting such an interesting story, but I was intrigued by the beginning of the story and the end. The book is not in the same league as the first book and is still very good. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I have been reading the series since the first one was released, and I love the characters and their story. I loved the way the story went about getting the books back on the market. I liked the fact that it was not just a series and it was written in a different style, but it was also a great read. I am a big fan of Ms. King, and I hope she continues to write better. I also like the fact that the story is told from the perspective of the characters and their lives. I think this is one of the best series I have read in a long time."
1,"There is detailed information about the history and the relationship between the two main characters, the strong and the weak. The story is well written and the characters are well developed. The chemistry between the main characters is great and the chemistry between the secondary characters is great. The story is short and sweet and a bit sweet at times, but it is sweet and sweet and sweet at the same time. I was given a copy of this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I have read all of her books and I really enjoyed them. They were so well written and the characters were believable. They were definitely different but they were still enjoyable."

0,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars."

0,"""Ordinary Men"" chronicles the rise and fall of Reserve Police Battalion 101, one of several units that took part in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question while in Poland. During the course of their stay, they were responsible for the shooting of 38,000 Jews, while also deporting 45,200 to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. The book argues that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and other units like it, were comprised of ordinary men. It begs the question: How did ordinary men become the cold-blooded killers of the Holocaust?  Author Christopher R. Browning does a tremendous job of covering the ground. He also presents a strong case that these people were indeed ordinary men, who came from ordinary backgrounds, only to end up being transformed into the murderers of thousands. However, the book also stresses that some of the men, including several officers, could not be considered ""ordinary,"" as they were trained in Hitler's Nazi organizations from youth. Browning also does something nearly impossible: He humanizes these people without excusing their horrendous actions. Their defense that ""they were just following orders"" just doesn't fit the bill, as some refused to take part in the actions, and asked to be relieved. If a few men could get themselves relieved from doing the killings, why did so many more not? That is the main question the book gives. ""Ordinary Men"" is an extraordinary book that chronicles just one unit that took part in the murder of innocent Jews, while also presenting a good case of how ordinary men can become killers. I highly recommend this book to all students of the Holocaust."

They did offer several other ""solutions"" but bottom line is, the top of my kitchen still isn't properly secured on one sid because the holes weren't secured properly and I could not get a replacement part. The kitchen is still sturdy and usable with this problem, but I would be happier if it could be 100% properly assembled because I do like this kitchen and want it to last."

The writing was good, but the story was too depressing to really keep my interest. It's also a little hard to keep track of the characters in this book"

0,"This hotel was magnificent! Not only was it a mini palace, but the staff was polite, helpful, and professional. In an e-mail I received before we left for Chicago, the concierge, Les, offered to get us tickets, directions, reservations to anything we'd like to see/do. He also got us an upgrade on our room, and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering, the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that. And so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi. The bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning!"
0,"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well...."

Well she found one Leland and now Jewel is stuck at this Horse fundraiser waiting to meet him when this man makes his way to the bar and Jewel is instantly taken by him. Of course Jewel is hidden where no one can see her while she checks this man out. Once she decides she is going to the bar where he is she doesn't expect him to talk to her but he does and then Jewel does something she never thought she would do.

Even if Jane is stubborn and determined to do it all on her own.  I could tell you everything that happens but what fun would that be.

0,"I greatly enjoyed the Decker/Lazarus early books at the beginning of the series.  They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care about, you almost forgot the books were in the ""Mystery"" genre.  Admittedly, I hadn't read a number of the novels in the middle of the series, but jumped to ""Gun Games"".  Although the elements of the early Decker/Lazarus novels were there, it seemed more ""commercially"" than ""character"" driven.  The ""F"" word abounds and even when it might fit the character and situation; it is over used.  Other graphic sexual terms and situations are also included.  The book seemed a mixed up jumble of young teenaged romance and sex with a mystery thrown in involving more of the same.  That said, the main characters, the foster son of Decker and Rina, 15 year old, Gabe, and his 14 year old girlfriend, are characters you like and hope to see as adults moving on with their lives in a later book.  But a lot less of the sexual details and foul language would be nice!"

0,"I have narrow feet and a high arch, so need a shoe that has good arch support, good cushioning and low volume but still roomy toe box that is not too stiff.  I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).  I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.  The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.  The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.  The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions."

1,"We booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago. However, our experience was significantly different from what we expected, for the following reasons. First of all, there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived. That person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes. Then when we got to our room, there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but I found them to be incredibly dusty. Just bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which I found distasteful. Overall it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it."

0,"The movie was just okay. We have all seen this script before in a thousand other movies. Although the movie's real life premise was indeed interesting, the script and directing was just unable to harness this dramatic and emotional narrative. Camera work was shaky to force tension; I hate it when novice directors do this -- it just makes viewers motion sick. Also, Ben is simply a terrible actor. He emotes nothing, and with a beard it's less than nothing. I almost felt as if there was a movie being filmed and he was silently photo-bombing every seen. They sold us this directorial masterpiece and we bought it. It just didn't even come close to a masterpiece and someone must have ""bought"" them the Oscar. Life of Pie should have been Best Picture; it out ranks this bar-none. Politically, I am convinced that this Oscar was bought -- this picture's fame was manufactured and purchased with Hollywood politics and a massive press push. Wait till it's at the dollar rental."

1,"I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. The Omni Chicago's age shows, and not in a 'great ambiance' way! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor, almost like mildew, that permeated the first room we were given. Seriously, it brought tears to my eyes! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma, but finally agreed to switch us to another room. The new one didn't smell, but was clearly past its prime. Housekeeping was almost nonexistent. We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. How can you forget to leave towels for the guests? I'm not one to complain, but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here, we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago."

I appreciated the insert showing the various features, but wondered why a power adapter (DC5V,500mA, whatever THAT is!) wasn't included to charge the unit.  Manufactures would be well-advised to remember that Baby Boomers still want to get out camping, or maybe even just upgrade our emergency gear. We will pay for quality, but need buttons to be easily read, instructions clear, and prefer all parts included. I feel like an idiot; can anyone tell me if the built-in lithium battery can be replaced, or is the product rendered useless when the battery dies?"
1,"I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago while I was on holiday recently and I have to say, that you definitely get what you pay for! I was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised. I was sorely mistaken. The first problem I had was when I got there they told me that they had double booked the suite I had reserved. They gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room. I should have left then but I decided to keep an open mind. After we were all settled in my husband and I went to The Palm restaurant. My husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times. Each time we asked them to fix it, they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff. After dinner, we went back to our room. Just sitting on the bed I knew it would be a long night. The mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them. When I went to the restroom, the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons! My husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one. We just didn't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in. I tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional. He pressed really had and hurt my back. Perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session! For lunch we tried Geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way. I decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later! Once I got sick, I was done. I went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because I was not going to sleep there one more night. I made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable. After a lot of arguing, he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel. This was the worst place I had ever stayed! I think a Super 8 Motel would have been more luxurious!"

I can't imagine a dog with a long, long tail getting bored with it.  I would have given this a 5 star if I could, but not because I have a chewer.  I have a short, long tail and this is just too long for him.  I have a big dog and he is a chewer, so I have to keep trying to break it into pieces.

0,I am disappointed in these to be honest.  I liked them... LOVED them actually.  I put them in some sconces I have on my bedroom walls.  A little ambient light in the evening while I'm closing up the house and going to bed.. and a little romantic lighting as well.  They worked on the timer for about a month.  I got them on March 8th.  Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.
1,Pretty useless- ordered 2 of these. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received from the company is the most defective.

For example, ""The World's End"" was a good movie, but ""The Fog"" was a little better.  I would have liked to have seen a different ending, but I found it a little too slow.  I don't know.

0,"Roman Polanski, born on august 18, 1933, has written a fascinating autobiography. He is a sinner and a genius, a chaotic man and a passionate, he is a machismo and a vulnerable human being, he overcame the WWII, the Polish ghettos and the Holocaust as a resilient child and he lost his wife Sharon Tate and an unborn child in 1969 by the Manson Group massacre, and on the other hand he overcame (as an adult) a special pattern of machismo-self-destruction (with 13 year old girl accusing him of sexual contact). He had lived a lousy life in Nazi-surpressed Polish ghettos and he had lived with too much pride and arrogance in Hollywood, he was arrested in the United States and nevertheless now he releases movies in Paris (presently married with French actress Emmanuelle Seigner). He is a gifted filmmaker and indeed: a writer, better than any crime-author I know; his book, published in 1984, is not a larmoyant, self-pitiful autobiography alike 1001 others - it is an absorbing story about a personality-mixture-hybrid of a Robin Hood mixed with Mac Beth, an Idi Amin mixed with a Mother Theresa, it is the story of ""Roman"" P., who started his life 1933 in Paris as ""Raymond"" P.; the first sentence of his autobiography: ""For as far back as I can remember, the line between fantasy and reality has been hopelessly blurred."" That became his helping trick to survive some struggles and tragedies, downfalls and comebacks ..."

0,"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over."
0,"Recently got this as a gift. I really like the Blue color on it. Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode. or tracking a activities. No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it. It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone. Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.  Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.  Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.  sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.  Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10. Most feature work great like viewing data and stuff but usually when hitting back button on certain part of the app it would crash other than that I find this jawbone to fit my daily usage very well."
0,"This doll house is extremely sturdy! All of the walls are nearly 1/4"" thick wood (or pseudo-wood composite) product. Some other reviews stated that the assembly instructions were very vague and difficult to read and that the product was difficult to assemble. I am happy to report that it's not! :) The assembly instructions were extremely simple, clear, and well-written (and I'm by no means a mechanic or carpenter - I normally have major issues figuring out how to get battery compartments open on toys - don't judge...some of those compartments are a real bear! (; ). All of the parts are well-labeled and easily identifiable so there's zero confusion. All of the parts lined up perfectly (a few other reviews said they didn't, so I'm thinking the ones that didn't weren't assembled correctly). The furniture that came with the dollhouse is also very sturdy and well-crafted. The lamp (which lights up) has a timer on it which helps with battery life. The house itself stands nearly four feet tall - it's really big! Compared to the flimsy plastic and cardboard Barbie doll houses for close to the same price (been there, done that, lasted a month before it was destroyed by light play!), this dollhouse is a hundred times sturdier and just plain superior. All in all, this is an heirloom quality product. I can easily see this beautiful, sturdy dollhouse lasting for a few generations at least!"

0,"I'm not sure if I'd really call this ""high gain"", but thanks to its antenna and USB extension cord, it does a better job of pulling in wi-fi signals than your typical ""nano"" or compact USB wi-fi adapter. The box contains the adapter, which looks like an oversize USB flash drive; screw-on antenna, a USB extension cord that's maybe 2 feet long, and a mini CD containing the drivers.  One minuscule quibble: Like most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with a cap intended to protect the USB plug when the adapter is not in use. And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.  The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.  As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager."

0,"I have to say it's been years since I have felt so engaged reading a book.  Oddly, I saw the movie before buying the Kindle book; and in the middle of reading, I decided to watch the movie again.  I suspect it won't be long and I will read the book once again.  This is a thinking person's book and story, and thus isn't for everyone.  But the mastery of the writing is so highly evocative that you ""see"" the book as you read it.  Incredibly deep characters, mesmerizing continuity of theme (which some might argue about, given that the book is written as segments contributing to a ""writ large"" story), the ability to make you laugh, cry and inevitably sigh, ""yes.""  I had never heard of David Mitchell before reading this book.  But it only took me 500+ pages to realize what an important writer and artistic voice he is.  I am a strong supporter of public libraries, and have downloaded Kindle versions of books to determine if I will actually buy the book.  In the case of Cloud Atlas, it was a no-brainer.  I finished Cloud Atlas today and immediately downloaded ""Ghostwritten"" from my local library.  I suspect it won't be long and my Kindle cloud will have all of his works in it.  If you think and therefore read, and read to think, Cloud Atlas will keep your mind whirling.  It's a must-read piece of literature. It's a truly gripping story."

0,"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill."

0,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.  The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.  Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.  Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.  I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.  Step up to the plate, Marvel.  Play time's over."

He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big  threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance  of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this  book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."

I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.  The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1"" deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.  I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!  I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.  The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep. Diamond quality, non-stick double coating It's heavy weight aluminized steel for superior heat conduction and even baking Strong and very durable, long lasting construction!"

1,"Jay Winik titles his work, and I thought it was a great book. I was disappointed. I had to read a few chapters to get to the end of the book. It was hard to get to the end of it. I don't know how many people were given a pass to read the book, but I did enjoy it. It was great to read about the lives of the young people who were on the train with the New York Yankees. I thought the book was a little hard to read, but it was worth it. I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I am hoping that the book will be better than the first one. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. I have read many of the book's books. I look forward to the next one. I really enjoyed this book and it was good to see the author take a step back and think about the life of the characters. I think it's a good story and I'm glad I got to see it out. The ending was a bit abrupt but it was nice to see it end. I have a feeling it won't be a repeat of the first two books. I will definitely read another of the series. I will definitely recommend it. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

1,"Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago. I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, I was left disappointed. I arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. Unfortunately, my room was not ready. It should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. In any event, I was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named BIG Bar. They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--I wanted only to relax in my room. I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. Was my room ready yet? 'What room?' they replied. To my astonishment, it seemed that I no longer had a reservation! How this came to pass, I do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake 'Guest Not Found' or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. I requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. Finally, I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than I would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. As it was, I found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. So if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. If you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere."

1,"Thankfully this book was not written to be an escape from the cold. It was written to be a read. The reader must be able to adapt to the new world and circumstances that it is living in. The characters are well developed. This is a very good book. I recommend it to anyone who is new to the world of fantasy. I've read all of Stephen King's books and I love them all. However, this one is very different. The story is about a couple who were estranged from their loved ones for years, but just couldn't get enough of each other. This book was a great read. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it immensely. The author does an excellent job of explaining the relationship between Stephen and Rose. Both are very strong people with a strong bond and love. The story is about the situation Stephen and Rose were in when they were separated. There was a lot of backstory that I didn't know about at all, but I loved it."

0,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales."

The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club). NOTES:  The sign outside the music store says ""8 Tracks"".  I feel so OLD!!  Speaking of, there are at least 2 terrific songs on the soundtrack, ""Got to believe in Magic"", ""King and Queen of Hearts"", etc.  Worth the price alone."
0,"I ordered this on Amazon Prime Day!  Item was delivered promptly and I regularly cook eggs with runny yolks in this pan.  I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.

The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl or any flaws that I could see. I was a little worried that it would leak but it does not and works very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled. The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part. So not only is this a great functioning product, but this works very well and looks elegant! I have had many compliments on this serving dish and I have referred many people to this bowl, I am over all satisfied with this product and this is just great and I couldn't be happier with this product.

0,"This movie to me was and is amazing. I saw it (rented it) and then bought it so I could watch it over several times. I read a negative review of it (by a professional critic I think) who said the first part was good, well made, but the 2nd part was not. This person missed the whole point.  First she gave the twist in the story so anyone reading the critique would not have this surprise and then she missed a lot of the undertones in the 2nd part. For instance she said ""he meets a young girl who happens to be a butoh dancer and that happens to be what his wife wanted to be"". That says it all, how the person misunderstood the whole story.  In fact the person goes to Japan to find the answer to the death  he cannot accept and in the first part we see his wife at a butoh performance in Berlin, the two parts of the movie tie in exactly. Also there is a clear analysis or how people view and deal with death in the east and the west. The young girl (the butoh dancer in Tokyo) has lost her mother and there is a poignant scene where she compares her mother to a duck (!! up and down, up and down) and gives a very sharp clue as to her mother's death. Also she has been rendered homeless from this death, her situation is quite desperate but in fact she deals with death so much better than our character who is trying to understand his loss from a western point of view.  This movie was a seminal event for me, maybe because I have had some losses in my family and am a dancer but it provoked a terrific surge of creativity , This movie also made me very happy in many ways..and it's beautiful. Just beautiful."

1,"Although the InterContinental Chicago Hotel is located on 'The Magnificent Mile,' our entire experience as guests there was anything but ....believe me, the 'magnificence' ends at the hotel entrance! From check-in to check-out, our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific. First, there was an error with our reservation, and once we got to our room, we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked, so down I trudged to the registration desk--where I had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes--to ask for help. The first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room; we weren't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls. Then, dog tired the next morning--even though we had hung a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on our door handle--in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand. Following that rude awakening, I was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife, who, upon entering the bathroom to take her shower, was greeted by an incredibly large roach! Breakfast--actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel--were served cold and were somewhat tasteless. We were routinely ignored by the concierge, who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him. Trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in. Of course, there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart. Getting out of the InterContinental Chicago was, believe me, the best part of our experience as guests there."

Its so very well written; Ms. DeWintons prose is very expressive, flowing and so easy to read. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE really made me want to go on such a cruise: the author describes the ship and the setting  Australia and New Zealand  so well, I felt I was there. I also love how Ms. DeWinton portrays the dance environment and the performers; that was a lot of fun. Dylan and Michaela are both such fabulous characters. Michaela is very confident in her abilities, but she is almost all-business all the time; she cares almost too much about her job and she desperately tries to rein in her passionate nature. Dylan is seductive and charming, but not aggressive; still he decides Michaela will relax even if it kills him. The chemistry between Michaela and Dylan is sizzling and feels very real.  I love the playfulness and the interactions between Dylan and Michaela; Dylan is quite a wonderful hero and steps up when needed. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is a wonderful romance, sexy and yet very realistic as the romance progresses naturally. HE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is fresh, colourful, fun and very entertaining!"

As pointed out throughout the 5 books, freedom loving people cannot coexist with nanny state leftist progressives.  Civil war in our modern age would be beyond intolerable, and both sides know we will never change the others mind.  This leaves us with one solution to our political problem: A Free State America and a Progressive Union America.  We as a people can then ""vote with our feet"" as to which side best represents our hopes and dreams.  Spoiler about the end of book 5:  While it has a feel good ending where a bankrupt and disillusioned LSA rejoins the USA and it mostly works out, I do not believe a reintegration  of millions of indoctrinated leftists would be possible without destroying the free society."

0,"Just received this horn, filled to 80 psi with my electric pump and installed.  This thing is loud.  It does,as one review said, sound like a Mack Truck on helium. Years ago I almost had a dog take me down on a motorcycle and have been afraid or riding near dogs ever since, so this is to scare the dogs.  I have only used it one other time and that was today when a car was backing out of a drive way and did not see me.  Use it seldomly or you will be a very unpopular person.  PS.  Does not work on ""Deaf"" dogs."
0,"This is less complicated than the Halti that frustrated us with seeming to never get it in the correct positioning. It also is less irritating to our dog who tries to get it off. She still reacts but with less effort to remove it from her snout. We have 2 large French Mastiffs (Dogie de Bordeaux). The largest is 150 lbs and she is the easiest to walk with the Gentle Leader. The other is 95 lbs and is 18 months old. She tries harder to get it off, but the design works to keep her from pulling. Once we say, Leave it, when she tries to get it off, she gives up and cooperates."

The water stays cleaner longer with the use of these.  I add a little distilled white vinegar to the water to keep bacteria growth down.  I have three dogs and two cats sharing this fountain.  To make the filter last longer, I rinse it under running cold water spray once or twice a week, and I clean the fountain once a week as well.  Rinsing the filters easily doubles their life. I've had my BDF for the past eight+ years, and I'm convinced the use of these filters and adding the vinegar, have kept the BDF running without a problem this long.  The 12 pack of filters is cheaper in the long run, and with care, I've been able to stretch their use to two years vice one."
0,"Girls (3 and 5) LOVE these books. This one is very detail oriented and they love the pictures. I was actually surprised at how long it was!

1,I was pleasantly surprised at how well the quality and design of the blade is matched to the one we replaced. The blades are very sharp and the blade is very solid. The blade is straight and the blades are not in the way. The blade is thin and holds a very sharp edge. I like the edge of the blade and it holds a great edge on my knife. I also like the overall look of the blade. I am very happy with this purchase.

0,"I really loved this book. Micah definately rides a fine line between ""you jerk"" and ""your an idiot"" in the beginning. But as you read there is just enough of a hint at his past and the thoughts of the supporting characters and you begin to see what and who he is on the inside. And you either love him or hate him. I LOVED him. For me, that was what made me keep turning the page. Plus there wasn't a lot of ""fluff"" (you know, the parts that you skip over cuz you just want to get back to the plot of the story). The story just flowed for me and the characters just seemed real (even though they are vampires. :)) And you know that after you've finished that this will be a series and I am very much looking forward to the next one. I hope this review helps cuz my writing skills really suck but I'm very good at reading and know a great book when I read it. Of course, thats just my opinion."

0,"Warning- some spoilers inside: Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better. Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry. And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing. The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book. I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three."

He is always a bit stubborn with it and it has held up well.  I think it has held up well to a few pull ups.  I'm really pleased with it.This is a great product for dogs that need something to keep them occupied. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog has a lot of separation anxiety and this one has worked out great. It is a bit thick and doesn't take up a lot of room. It is easy to put on and it is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for a while now and it is very well made and very durable.Works great.Our dog loves them and is happy.My cats love these.  My dog is about 15 lbs.  He was very picky about his food so I would give this a try.  It's not a big deal and we feed our pets anything.  He eats it pretty much every day and it's a nice change of pace.  He has been eating it a lot and is enjoying the taste of it.  I'm sure he'll like it even more if he grows into a bigger dog.This is a nice little fountain, and the cats love it!  They love it too!

A story about real life troubles in the peerage and the way real people get through them.

0,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE  This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.  This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.  This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!  A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000 hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.  The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................  I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.  I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time."

0,"When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.  There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.  The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.  Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.  So enjoy this movie for what it is. I do."
0,"Oh gosh!  Other reviews were accurate.  Missing a part, rather two of the same part, made for a missing piece of the cross member.  How darn sloppy can they get over there in China?  This was delayed in shipping by 3 days too, like others experienced. It is nothing special, but will do the job okay. Takes some thinking to put together, took about 1.5 hours.  Heavy unit.  Nice cover to cover up the mistake. If I had a factory job putting these in boxes to send to my trading partner, I would hang my head low. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy and duh. I felt like I needed to wash the paint chemical off my hands when finished, I did and lived. Like so many things it is okay, but you know, sloppy."

1,I was under the impression that this was an inexpensive replacement for a GFCI replacement.  It is indeed an inexpensive replacement for a GFCI replacement.  It is very sturdy and it is well made.  The g-wire is very thin and holds the g-wire securely.  The bottom line is that it is a very sturdy and well made g-wire replacement.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive replacement for an old GFCI replacement.  I would also recommend that anyone looking for a replacement for a GFCI

I just wish it came in a different color for her. I have a small dog and she can walk"
1,If you are a die hard fan of the series you will enjoy this book. I am one of those people who had a lot of fun with the series and wanted to find out what happened to the characters in the sequel.

1,"My husband and I visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for our honeymoon. The customer service was amazing. From the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing. These people were proficient, respectful and very thoughtful. The Fairmont had a lounge, a wine room, a bar and a restaurant. I couldn't decide where I wanted to go first! After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room... It was totally delicious. We also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon! Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa, once again excellent!! Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time. We stayed in the gold room. Although it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows. My husband and I relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city. It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget. Four thumbs up!"
1,"I bought these mainly to go with my wide-body swim suit.  They fit as expected.  The top is a nice, solid material, the shoulders are nice, and the bottoms are well-constructed.  The elastic is nice, and the crotch area is not too tight.  I have a narrow chest, but these are very comfortable.  I like the way they hold up, but I'm not sure if they will hold up long after I wash them.  I'm 5'10"", about 165 lbs, and these fit perfect, not too tight, and not too loose."

I am loving our great Aussie writers - go girls! A small girl disappears into thin air while in the care of her older brother who has lived with the guilt all his life. His mother has never recovered and his father eventually walks away from this dysfunctional family. A young lady with a daughter who has Down Syndrome has come to stay in the house the family let out and she suddenly discovers a new ""imaginary playmate"". A compelling read."

0,"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.  If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.  You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.  The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.  The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.  The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.  Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.  I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.  I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it."

1,This book is in fact a real book. It is a history of how the USA came to be. The story is told from a very different point of view. In this book we are told about the history of the USA from the beginning. The story starts in the mid 1800s. The USA was created by the military in the form of a strong navy. It was a very powerful navy. The USA was created because of a well developed navy. The navy was created by a very strong military.

Not once did the author lose his mastery, and I watched events unfold as if I was there but also reading a history book about real people, battles, and places. Sword and sorcery fanatics, feed you addiction with this read. I would have added more stars if possible."

1,"My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple's getaway from our usual life, and an escape it truly provided. There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time, let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us, because things like alarm clocks, hairdryers and ironing boards were already there, electronic media even available for rent. With a comfortable bed, control over how the room felt, no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call, we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity. Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning, but the Hilton was a true vacation. Thank you."

0,"How many drawbacks can you think of when one man only thinks about himself and controls most of the government? Think about a life where water is rationed and that water is suddenly gone. Where that one man decides the fate of all who live in those areas when water no longer available. Exiled is a great story with many strong, likable (and hated) characters in a realistic, future world. What starts out as a normal day for Brooke and her two children soon turns into a race to leave their home when she realizes that something is not right. The story jumps across the United States, following this corrupt man and his opponents as he pushes through a vile piece of legislation dealing with the waterless area. Within this story are parts of really interesting storylines that will hopefully be explored and expanded. My hope that this one man gets his due will keep me reading until the end!"
0,"I usually don't like to read short stories as I enjoy involving myself in the depth of a story but decided to try these as I do really like Jeffery Deaver and his winding plots. Surprise, surprise I enjoyed all three as quick reads and they work out well when waiting for appointments, etc. I have a habit of reading two or three books at a time and that does not work well with short stories because my feeble brain gets confused when one story ends so fast but I love Deaver so it was worth it."

0,"These shoes are really cute, and I love that they're made in the USA. Unfortunately the cushioning didn't feel right for my foot, but that's not a problem inherent to the shoe. They might work well for someone with different feet. They fit true to size, although they are a little stiff. But they might work well once they're broken in. I can't speak to that since I returned them, but they seem like decent shoes."

This cover is touted as ""kid proof"" and so far it has been exactly that. It's replacing an OEM cover from Apple, which in retrospect was a waste of money by comparison. It fits like a glove and so far has been good protection. We have, fortunately, not had occasion to do a serious drop test with it, but it has withstood drops from the couch and table just fine. I'm quite pleased with it."

0,"Like ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE, another recent bestseller that left me cold, I found STATION ELEVEN too (self)-consciously crafted, too mannered, to enjoy. I was never able to escape into the story; the writing, gorgeous as it was, always kept me at arm's length, reminding me that I was reading, well, gorgeous writing. (The plot was pretty predictable too; how many ""virus-ends-the-world"" narratives do we need?) This is not a criticism of the author's abilities, but I personally enjoy novels that are a bit less polished, novels that allow me to forget the craft and lose myself in the story. It's a fine line, I'll admit--too little craft calls attention to itself as surely as too much. But there is a balance, and for me, this novel didn't achieve it."

I have bamboo cutting boards and since I know bamboo stands up well to water, this was an easy purchase for me. It does not fit over my soaking tub and isn't adjustable, but fits in my standard tub in my guest bath. It gives the guest bath a spa-type feel. It can be used on a dresser or counter top in addition to the tub. It's spacious and securely holds wine glasses. If this had rubber grips for on the edge of the tub, I'd rate it 5 stars, but overall I really like it."

It was definitely a fun read, and leaves you hanging so that you HAVE to read the sequel.  Yes, it does not set up blacks in a very good light, but one must consider the time it was written.  In any regard, many of the whites were portrayed in unseemly manners as well (cutthroat, evil, stupid, cowards, etc.).  As an adult, I would believe that people are smart enough to weed out the literary license taken by this piece of fiction; and discuss the book with their children as to it's story, characters, and intent.  I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did."

1,"A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. The hotel was a bust from the get go. As we arrived in the lobby, we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. (We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes.) When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. We had to wander around the halls looking for our room. Once we got to our room, we thought the weekend was going to get better. The rooms are modern and nicely designed. That was about all that this hotel had going for it though. As soon as we started to explore the room more, it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. The bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. We called a worker and they cleaned most of it up, but the thought of it still remained. As we all settled down to sleep, there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. After about an hour, we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. The woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago. They were staying there the next 2 nights. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! It's a hard rock hotel all right. (At least that's what the beds feel like!)"

0,"Sad that this doesn't come with any of the critters. It is basically an add-on for those who already own some of the Calico Critter sets. For $20.00 I would have expected at least one. Well, we shall put it up until we get some of the Calica Critters to go with it. For now, all I can say us that is looks nice and well crafted and you can turn the handle and make it spin. Shrugging this one off for now. Docking 2 stars for not including that it doesn't come with a Critter anywhere in the product description."
1,"Ally is a young non-dating woman who has just learned to take a stand for her beliefs and has decided to move on. The town of Sawyer is in the midst of a great drought and is taking a chance on the chance of a fresh start.  Hannah is a gorgeous woman with a strong womanly voice. She is also a very charismatic and sexy man. She has a strong sense of humor, and has a lot of strong friends and family. Hannah's very loyal and sweet friends have been her best friend since they were teens. She is also very protective of her friends and is determined to help her friends find a way to be with them.  I loved how the story progressed and how the characters developed. I hope there is more to come in the next book in this series.I received an ARC of this book for an honest review.  My Rating: 4.5 stars  I loved this book. It had some great characters.

0,"This is the first time I have ever used, or heard of kin+kind products. This is  all organic nothing in this that could harm my dogs, even if they lick it off..I also put coconut oil In our dogs food everyday, and that has worked fantastic.  My little indoor dog got a road rash on her tummy when she followed our very large dog that jump up on a big boulder (we live in the mountains in Ca.) . she missed and slid down. At first we did a Antibiotic cream, but as its been healing, we then put on kin+kind for her scrape. This seemed to heal her pretty fast. The big dog is also a indoor dig, but during the spring and summer he gets allergies on his tummy, and turns very red. I'm  hoping this will solve the problem, as all the creams and meds the Vet has given him does not work.  My son just came back from a camping trip with dryed hands , elbows, & split knuckles from the cold weather, he put this on his hands and 4 days later his hands ect. Are  better. That said this has a strong scent to it ,but it does not last long. I think the scent is from the Tea Tree oil! So far I'm impressed with  kin+kind products."
0,"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statements of facts introduced into this book are true.  Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.  Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.  Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.  As I was thawing out mentally from the vast empty ice floes of northern Greenland where the novel played out its last pages, I began to see a few areas in the plot where Hoeg was skating on pretty thin ice.  But while I was reading, they didn't show, and even after, they didn't matter much.  Smillas cold universe was amazingly real, whether it was true or not."

The rooms are nice, spacious, clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need. I have to say that I have fallen in love with the Hyatt chain due to their customer service. I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly, which you don't often see at other hotels. I used the self-check in machine, and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Then, when she saw that my room was not on a high level, she offered to have it changed for me so that I could have a better view. I would highly recommend this hotel!"

I have not had any issues with the holster with the Glock 17. I did get a free shipping coupon on this holster so if you are looking for a holster with a decent price then go ahead and order one of these. I will be happy to help you find a holster that is as good as this one. I have a Glock 17 and it fits well in my hand. I would suggest you buy one of these for the Glock 17 as it is well made and has a lot of room for my Glock 17. I will be buying another one for my Glock 17.
0,"This is a sturdy sprinkler with adorable, colorful caterpillars. As other reviewers have noted, that's pretty much the whole show.  It sprays water in one position and is good for children who are not comfortable with water coming from surprising directions or in varying forces. For that purpose, I have added an extra star because all kids respond to stimuli differently and I think there's a definite market out there for this specific targeted audience. However, parents of kids who are interested in a greater variety of actions from their water toys may want to look elsewhere."

0,"Sunset Hill by Everett Powers is a thriller novel featuring a California police officer named Grant Starr.  In Sunset Hill the Sunset Hill killer is back despite the fact that they had a woman in jail that had confessed to prior crimes.  This is the third book in the Grant Starr series and the first one that I have read.  Sunset Hill opens with our killer picking up a newly divorced man at a local bar as she gives the reader a peak into her strategy for choosing her targets.  Between the murder mystery aspect of the book and the social interactions that occur between Grant and the other main characters the plot moves quickly and with great interest.  Having not read the other books in the Grant Starr series did not seem to detract from my understanding of the plot and enjoyment of the book.  That said, I typically like to read books in order so when I pick up my next Everett Powers novel it will be the first Grant Starr novel so that I can get the benefit of watching the characters develop."

It doesn't claim to be in that space. I expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved. A only a small notch too!. Lovely clean and bright room. Superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. Excellent service all round and nice staff. For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. Couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the Four Seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. We will go there again when in Chicago. Great location too."

And for the record, I think I knew as much as Ava much of the time. LOL  I laughed hard at the hi-jinks.  I especially loved Ava's thoughts on goblin anatomy, and pretty much her thoughts on men in general.  I am definitely going back - or forward - for more in the series.  The narrator was great!  She really seemed to channel Ava, and she did a good job voicing the other characters, as well.  I was voluntarily provided this free review copy audiobook by the author, narrator, or publisher.  ."

Update:  I was able to get it to work. The sound quality is a bit muddy but I can't say anything about that. If you have a computer with a different size hub, you may want to try to get a larger hub. Update 2: I've now had a few hours with this hub, which is about as good as it gets. I've found that it is really easy to set up and configure. It takes about 10 minutes to set up and it does a good job. It also has a dedicated USB hub for it's devices. I also found that the USB hub is pretty sturdy and I find that it keeps the laptop on a very well ventilated surface.

For the steep price we paid to stay there, we expected a friendly staff and clean room, which we did not get. First of all, the rooms are not clean. We found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed. When we reported this information to the hotel staff, they did not do anything to help us out. The staff is very unfriendly. Also, there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom."

0,"This was a film that took a lot to get through. I stuck with it because I was told the ending was the best. No, it was not. I understand this was a play or a farce of films and Broadway, but it really had nothing to offer. Most of the action takes place in a restaurant or outside on the street. It is slow going, with nothing to offer. A nice cast, Jeffrey Tambor and Jesse Plemons, but it did not rise above mediocre. Not Recommended For Me."

0,"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend."

0,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.  Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.  I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.  While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.  There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.  A very solid 4/5 Stars.  {This title was received free of charge from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.  I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.

I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.  These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.  These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.  A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""...

This one has some interesting characters and plots, but it is well written and well paced.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I loved this book.  I just couldn't get into it and am still reading it.  I love the way the author takes a lot of information from other books and leaves out the ""raw"" parts of the story.  I guess it's a good thing that I have read this book before, but I never found myself wanting to read it again.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves this genre, and I'm glad that I did.  I know I'm not alone in my dislike for the series, and I'm glad I didn't pick up this book to read it.  I'm not going to spoil the story for you, but the story was worth it"

This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for small jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value. I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to install. It was easy to adjust the fan speed and the speed and the height of the fan. The height was easy to adjust, so you could adjust the height of the fan, the height of the fan and the height of the fan. It was easy to install and it was easy to adjust the height of the fan.

The low power level is useless for transmitting more than a few feet.  The high power level gives a pretty nice signal through my whole house and garage.  I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.  If you want to transmit to a stationary receiver (or maybe a higher-quality portable receiver), it should be fine."

Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year. Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.  Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way. Characters from previous books show up and are mentioned but theres enough context to determine who is who without giving away their stories."

I'm sure it will be fine, but it isn't quite as good as the older models.  When using this, if you do big activity with you dog, like chasing a ball with a long leash attached, if they go too far and pulls on this too much, it can come unsnapped.

He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.  I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.  Overall I enjoyed this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series to see how the other characters fared."

In comes traction tape, a great alternative to painting sand onto the steps (which I planned on doing until I saw this tape). I applied these during the fall when the wood wasn't dry after three days of sun... But I wanted it applied before the season's got worse. After the first day of rain, these did come up a bit, but general suction kept them applied to the board. I am sure if the wood wasn't damp when I applied them intially, there would be no problem of them moving around now. I am still very satisfied and pre-bought a second roll to apply appropriately. I also wanted to mention that this company gives great advise for applying this tape that came in quite handy."

I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off.

It was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. It was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves.

1,This fitness circle is smaller than a regular gym bag. I will admit that it's a bit bulky. If you want to get a solid workout then this is the bag for you. The only thing I would change is the size of the padding. This bag is still large enough for me and a 2 person with a 2 person body type. I will probably only use this if I need to do something more than just a cardio workout. The padding is very soft and very comfortable. The material is very durable and works very well. I highly recommend this bag. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I've used this product for about a year now and it's been working great.
1,"There are some great ideas here. The only problem is that it's not really a book about the Civil War.  The Civil War is a social history of the United States, and that's not really what the book is about.  There are many people who still remember the war, and a lot of them are still alive today.  There is a lot of research on the Civil War, but there is not much else.  The book is about a group of people who went to war in order to gain the right to vote, and that is not what the book is about.  The book is about the Civil War itself, not the history of the Civil War.  There is a lot of research on the Civil War, but there is not much else.  There is a lot of research on the Civil War, but there is not much else.  The Civil War was not a perfect war, and I thought it was pretty good."

0,"Spade is an important character to understand. He's Bones' best friend. One knows a man by his friends, so learning about Spade lends understanding to Bones. Spade mostly kept to himself until ""Destined for an Early Grave. "" Therefore, ""First Drop of Crimson,"" Frost's follow-up novel, sheds a lot of light on Spade's motives for his past actions. Although this installment in the Night Huntress world is not my favorite, it has some truly magical moments, and is important to the series as a whole."

0,"I love military fiction and particularly those stories that are fast-paced and full of action.  I just stumbled upon author Eric Meyer and was thrilled with the first of his books that I've had a chance to read, ""Black Ops Heroes of Afghanistan"".  The story of an undercover rescue mission of a CIA operative, this is a harrowing tale behind enemy lines.  The main character, Rafe Stoner, is both tough and likable and the action that he sees with his sidekick, Greg Blum, felt very real to me.  A great read that has me wanting more.  Recommended."

0,"This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:   - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.   - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents   - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.  The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.  I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.  I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value."

0,"I enjoyed this book, but the first half was dull compared to the second half. I felt like Duane spent too much time making inside jokes, displaying ""cute"" aspects of wizardry (I don't think I can forgive her for ""WizPod,"" still), and name-dropping about a bajillion previous characters so we wouldn't forget about them before they became completely unimportant to the plot. I did like where it led, though--to the terrifying transformation of Nita's partner Kit into a tool of his previous Martian incarnation, and I liked how Nita didn't lose her cool when she was scared and had to rescue Kit.  Despite being about aliens, I saw a disappointing side of ""human"" nature reflected in the two transplanted Martian cultures refusing to give up their desire to fight each other--it was what they lived for and what they died for. Nita and Kit finally acknowledging some of their attraction was nice, though I would have been just as happy to see a special partnership that was close and nearly sacred WITHOUT being romance. And I thought it was odd that Duane spent so much time focusing on stuff Dairine was doing without actually mixing it into the plot's finale. She usually finds a way to do that, and instead all we've gotten was a side trip to build up what will probably pay off in the next book. I was also a bit uncomfortable as I read about Kit's older sister Helena . . . I don't remember her from previous books, and felt like she was grafted into the family along with a history that I don't remember being mentioned before."
1,"Well, I am crying my eyes out and hoping the next book will be as good as this one. I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it. The characters are well written and well developed.

0,"If you're looking for a solid, sturdy, high profile, dovetail scope mount, this is it. Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.  The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.  It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.  Solid construction. Definitely would recommend."

1,"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog. Some people think it's ok to give some food to your dog and others say it's ok to give them a treat. If you have a dog with a long mouth or a sensitive stomach, I think that's fine. If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit. I've found that having a dog with a sensitive stomach is not as important to your dog as having a hard body and to a dog that is sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest. My dog also likes some of the soft treats she gets but she doesn't like the soft ones."

I have great sympathy for the storyteller but I have to be honest and say that as a book, this piece of work is really substandard.  It makes for very boring reading and serves only to create the ""shock effect"" from all of the horrid things that are revealed.  This should not have been put into a book but relegated a short story in some magazine somewhere. Don't waste your money buying the book."

0,"Jade West's writing is impeccable and if you like the teacher/student scenario, ""Teach Me Dirty"" is one of the best I've ever read. The relationship between Mr. Roberts and Helen is portrayed as honest, pure and sensitive.  I loved how the author wove his traumatic and torturous past into the story.  It gave more meaning to his acceptance and love for Helen."

1,"Great Story, Great Plot! But, it's just too much for me.  The movie has a couple of extra scenes, but, they're just too short to be worth it. The only extras are the special features, which are nothing special.

0,"The whole movie is promoting BUDWEISER beer. Is it a lie that Budweiser is the only beer available?  The human nature attracts to beautiful woman and strong handsome man. That is the truth. In the wild male bird gets attention from the mate, becuase their feather is shining and their voice is loud. Why Jennifer Garner should marry a fat and no-that-good-looking guy instead of Robe Lowe?  You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.  What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?  I do not have religion. But I have no way of proofing there is no God. In the movie it mentions about mansions afterlife. How about 60"" 3D hi-definition TV for everybody, etc.? It's not what religion about."

It's a beautiful love story that transcends the corporeal world, but this concept is very difficult to embrace in the Western world (or at least for me and most of my classmates) since the two lovers rarely interact. However, the poetry that love evokes within Majnun is beautiful and worth spending time on. Frankly, the second half will be more dynamic than the first half, so stay with it and it'll be worth it."

0,"What a delightful short story this is! Just what I needed - a feel good, romantic, Christmas story.  The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)  This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.  Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?  The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.  The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.  My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?  All in all a great short read which left me with a huge smile on my face when I finished it."

All his plots take place in Florida; he is a Florida resident and a graduate of the University of Florida.  Hiaasen's style is humorous, current and filled with characters and their development that make the read chuckle and laugh out loud.  Hiaasen's style is succinct, stylistic, and  creative.  Have recommended Hiaasen to many friends over the years and have yet to have one say his books were not a great read."
1,I got married in the Chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel. They had nothing but nice things to say about it! My husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs. The rooms are decorated so nicely and they don't have that funny hotel smell. The Pump Room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports. If I'm ever in the area again I will be sure to book a room at the Ambassador East Hotel!

I also have had to use a cheap plastic back plate to get it to fit.  I am not sure if it will be long enough to get used to, but if I get used to the plastic back plate, I am not going to need it.  I will probably try a different one that does not have the plastic back plate.

1,"I stayed three nights recently at the Hilton Homewood Suites- Downtown Chicago. Overall I can't rate this establishment highly. The person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. Once I finally got my key, the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. It didn't get any better when I got to my suite. The bed was poorly made, and I found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. The room was very stuffy, and I swear might have even had a vague pet smell. My shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door,and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. Also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. I also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. It had limited equipment that was in poor repair. The floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. While the indoor pool looked good, as I dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. All in all, the amenities, the unfriendly service, and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one I would definitely not recommend to anyone. When that is paired with their sky high room rates, it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests."

I would not suggest people waste their money on these honestly.
0,"I use this with the larger size bowl, but the smaller one makes a nice extra cup for my purse or glove department. With the bottle, it does bounce on my leg while walking, but not enough that I notice it. It's really nice to use on a walk.  06/15/15 I'm changing my rating from five stars to three because the water bottle now falls out of the loop. I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.  Maybe if attached to something that doesn't bounce as much, such as a knapsack, it would still work fine. But I only use a fanny pack when walking my dog, so it's attached to that."

I enjoyed the fact that the book was so well written. I was quite surprised to see that the author did not write the book down. I am sure that it is a great book for the younger reader, but I am not sure that it is the best book for the teen.I like that the story is not over.

Legs extend utilizing gravity as they're not spring loaded, and do not allow for partial forward positions as they lock either raised up or turned down. The mounting base is quite strong, and occupies about two inches of rail but stays in place with a single recoil lug. The thumb knob used for adjusting cant and legs is rather small. On my unit the cant could not be locked, or tightened enough to prevent accidental rifle cant. Overall I rate the quality very high, but the features and functionality are a bit lacking."

0,"The hotel is well located, but the service is poor. They seem to cater to large conventioneers, with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical Fairmont. There are too many specifics to outline here, let's just say that from the front desk, to the spa, room service which only got my order correct one-day, to housekeeping which didn't even clean my room one day (although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room. Yep, that's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings! They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience! The hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator. I've stayed at this Fairmont twice. The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price. But it's not worth enduring such poor service. That was the last time for me."

0,"My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having. These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set! The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy. The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up. I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone. I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.  All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers! I did receive this product at a discount/free in exchange for an honest review. I strive to provide fellow consumers with the most detailed, unbiased and (hopefully) helpful reviews that I can, believing that allowing a discount to influence a review is a disservice to other shoppers.

The Durvet Nu-Stock Ointment might work well, but I guess it's best if used on livestocks and out-door pets.  Definitely not recommended if you have an indoor pet.

1,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. The hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive. The concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay, and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do. We were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. The decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood. The bar and lounge areas had excellent service, and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown Chicago. Additionally, my husband and I were extra pleased to learn that because we are AAA members, we would be receiving 20% off our room rate for the weekend. Overall, the amenities and experience of staying at the Hotel Allegro Chicago made us feel like movie stars, pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment, one in which we would definitely choose to stay again."

0,"seSo I've owned this about a month. I was so impressed by the specs when placed next to the cost it was an easy win. I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt. I have done all I can do to calibrate but nothing really helps.  The cheapest of laptop provides a better viewing experience - colourwise. WHAT is the point of this wonderful resolution of 3200 x 1800 if the colour accuracy is piss poor and your eyes deteriorate."

My gosh... Very funny vignettes of male lead trying to find true love, Or at least Normal love. Can't get over that title, When you watch the movie, And you should it has girls and romance and funny bits thru out,You will wonder ""WHY or Why ?"" Did they name it that... Matthew James ( Merl  on ANGEL  tv series) is very likable and makes sense out of this love-starved artist role and has some good luck in bed too. Sadie Katz (AB Buddy spokesmodel ) has A DEMI MOORE-esque vibe and seems a whole person in character,Not someone off a written page. Jacqui Holland has an uncredited role as a sidewalk pickup, She and her tattoo make some very funny moments early on in film. So, Icky title, Great premise and actors capable of making it almost 'sweet romance'."

0,"I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years. In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores. Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare. I love them but replacement has been needed. After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand. The  stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25. The  Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly. No two pair seem the same.  However, The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent. The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.  Not having a local source for the Levi brand, I ordered through Amazon. The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglers available locally. Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers. As a matter of fact, it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.  The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult  jeans. The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son's boy jeans.  Last, the jean's waist and length were at least 2 inches large. Years ago, Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.  In summary, the fabric, the zipper, and inconsistent sizes are all  very sub-par. The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.  This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.  Avoid mail order Levi jeans"

0,"I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.  The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.  All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.  The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin."

0,"H. Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, ""Where's the Beef?""  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know."

1,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters. The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them. This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget. This is a great book."
1,"1984 by George Orwell is a novel, with a distinctively dystopian plot that makes the reader feel as if they are the protagonists. The characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting.  The novel is in many ways a reflection of the American political scene. Its almost eerie, and a bit depressing at times, and it is a great way to introduce a new generation of readers to the subject matter of dystopian literature. But the novel is also an interesting introduction to a new generation of readers to dystopian literature. The novel is a fun, quirky read, with plenty of twists and turns.  In short, it is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read.

Those of us who are fans of the Cora's Bond and Cora's Choice series know the storyline from Cora's point of view.  Now we can follow what happened through Dorian's eyes.  Book 3 takes us up to the time Cora is introduced to the vampire community as Dorian's new cognate, chosen with the help of his new technology created to help cut the number of individuals who must die in the process of finding a mate.  An exciting race to save Cora from others who would do her harm starts the story.  It ends with a shell-shocked Cora who continues to learn more than she wants to know about the supernatural world she is now a part of.

0,"These trains arrived promptly all in a tiny see thru plastic zip top bag. They are slightly larger than the trains that came with my Mexican train domino set, but just barely. I purchased these when my teenager lost 6 of the 8 trains we had and we had only played a handful of times. I waited for months hoping the trains would show up. Low and behold within days of buying these trains she found the lost trains. Figures, right?  Now we have a lovely selection of the solid colored trains that came with our game and several more to choose from!  Solid, clear colored ones and some with glitter, something to appeal to everyone. I didn't think the train colors were ugly at all as some reviewers said. And if you should get an ""ugly"" color in your batch just think of it like the most unplayed token in Monopoly, it's really not the end of the world. They are sturdy little trains and are very similar to the ones that came with our game, no complaints here. *would like to include a picture but on my mobile I'm unable to do so,  I'll try again soon."

0,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.  Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.  The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well."
1,"Sure it's mostly fiction (uh, yeah) and the movie is pretty much a turn-on for the older generation. The story is also a bit too long, and the acting is okay, but it's a little too long.

1,"If you have ever tried to read the book, you know it's going to be a pretty good read.  This is the story of a young woman who goes to a local newspaper to pick up a newspaper.  She's a young woman who lives with her father and her mother.  They're both very close to each other, and have a lot of fun together.  They're very different, and I think that's the only reason they're so well-known.  They have a lot of things going on in their lives, and they're also very different.  Their lives are very different.  They're very different from each other.  It's a very different world, and it's a very different place.  I think that's a good thing, because it allows us to see the different aspects of each of them.  There are so many different aspects of their lives that I really enjoyed reading about.  I enjoyed the book very much.  I think that there is a lot going on in their lives, and I think that the story of this young woman is very touching.  I think that the book is a very good read, and I think that it's a very good book.  It's a very good book, and I think that it's a very good book."

I've had great success with my dogs on this food. I am very happy with this purchase.This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they love it!

I have to say, though, that it is not exactly the best toy I've ever bought.  It is a little smaller than a tennis ball, but it's not a huge deal.

1,"The original Psycho-Cybernetics had a few interesting ideas.  The first book was a little too long and boring.  The second book was a bit too long and boring.  The third book was a bit too long and boring.  The last book was a little too long and boring.  I felt like the author was going to get rid of the ending and just start over.  I didn't like the ending and I didn't like the characters.  It's very sad that this book is ending.  I'd like to see more of these characters.  I read this book in one sitting.  I have to say that it was not my favorite.  I was bored and disappointed."
0,"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..  One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.  Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.  All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus."

The plot is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity: a bunch of innocent people, plus a cop, are on a bus. A terrorist has put a bomb on the bus, so if the bus slows down everyone blows up and dies. And the bus happens to be on an ordinary, crowded big city highway. So once you realize ( very early on in the movie ) that the bus is definitely *not* going to blow up, you can enjoy the ride. So once we're handed the simple, bare-bones scenario, we get to see every single complication that can occur with one speeding bus, scared people, and public roads. Every single possibility of loss of life and horrible danger is explored in loving detail. That is where this movie gets really fun: just sit back and enjoy the ride. That's all you have to do with this movie."

0,"Review of Secondhand Lions Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017  Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good."

I didn't pick up on whom she married and had to go back and read that part and there really was no clue aside from the name. I really didn't understand why Tinker just left and felt that could've been explained better. But I really liked the descriptions of New York and all the places that aren't there anymore. I had no idea the subway pictures were real or would've paid more attention to them.

This is a great product and I highly recommend it.I use this as a hiking pack.  The first time I used it I was going to use it as a backpack and I was so excited to use it.  This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.  The zipper is nice and thick, but it's not so good that it's going to be uncomfortable for a long time.  I would recommend this pack for the price.  It's not a great product, but if you are looking for a pack that's not bulky, it's a good one.  I'd recommend this pack to anyone that wants to take it camping.It's a very nice quality glove.

But it is a paradise with a purpose...  This classic film, made even as the war clouds were gathering in Europe and armies on the march in Asia, is well-acted and an excellent adaptation of the original novel. I even love the lamasery, even though it seems more art deco than Tibetan. To be sure, this film was restored through several techniques, replacing lengths of film removed when it was originally shown, using stills to supplement surviving adio, etc. This technique was used with Metropolis and I think it works at  least as well with Lost Horizon."

I don't think she has even tried on the pads, but she's all over those little gloves.  I would buy this again just for those silly gloves.  I have had some other parents tell my that their kids liked fingerless gloves.  I remember liking fingerless glove when i was a kid, actually I have a nice pair as an adult, they are just cool, so get some."
0,"I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work! I would not recommend buying this bottle."
1,"Loved the bag until both of my cats started to bleed out after a few days. I'm not sure if it's the bag itself or the product itself, but the cats were pretty much taking it away when I opened it.I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the best price. I have a German Shepherd and I had to buy a second bag so I could use it. It does hold up well, but the metal bars on the sides are very thin. The material is very strong and I'd be happy with it if it were thinner. I just wish the bars were more sturdy.I like that the water is not too acidic. It helps keep the water fresh"
0,"King has a natural (maybe supernatural) talent of writing horror novels. Everyone knows that. What a lot of folks don't know is he is one of our generations greatest writers period taking genre out of the equation. I've never read a novel that jumps back and forth to two timelines that I've enjoyed...until now. King does it effortlessly and fluidly. Also the story itself is so absorbing I had a hard time putting this book down each night. Childhood and childhood fears are two things King does great with and this story is no exception. The young characters come to life instantly. Its easy to picture each one. With all that said, this is perhaps the scariest novel I've ever read. One novel comes to mind that trumps this one in the scare department and its not King. It was immensely spooky because it dealt with not only childhood fears, which we can all relate to, but an evil of magnitudal proportions. Yes, this book is long but every paragraph is needed to build this story. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy if you've never read this."

0,"I absolutely love this. I am a slow reader but read this in 3 days, including going to work and school. I could not put it down for the life of me. Same was with LID. I can't wait for Book #3 to come out. I was kind of skeptical about this book since it seems like everyone and their brother are writing about Vampires. This one was different in my opinion. I was totally drawn to the characters. I felt like I was a part of the book. I don't get that feeling too often. All around an awesome read."

0,"Don't stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation. About 3 months ago, we booked a room here for our wedding night (which is in less than 2 weeks). My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel - no upgrades, no discounts. Apparently it is my problem that their manager can't manage the convention schedule. I don't even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I don't find their reservation system reliable. Unfortunately, due to the conference, there isn't any other place to stay."
1,"These are great. The car looks real and the materials are good.  My son loves this and we have two of the cars.  He also likes the plastic ""hanging"" pieces that go around the car.  The pieces are very sturdy.  This car is very durable.  We have 2 other cars, the most recent one had holes in it."
1,Well made- I want my son to be able to play with it. Nice little guy!  Works as advertised.
1,"Aack!! I forgot there was a second part.  I was expecting a lot of the stuff he was talking about.  The second part was also interesting, but not so great as the first.  I still liked him, but it was a little too abrupt for my liking.  I think it's because I was expecting it to be a little more on the emotional side of things.  I would recommend reading it to anyone who is looking for a great story about a man who is strong enough to take on a lot of pain, and who is also a strong enough guy to take on a lot of pain.  This book was a good read.This was a very good book. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I would recommend it.This is a good story with lots of twists and turns. I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  It was a quick read.  I liked that the author didn't just draw me in.  I was very drawn to the characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone."

0,"This was a very entertaining read.  I enjoyed hearing the adventures that the two main characters had in their lives.  It was a surprise to read of the extreme illness that Robert Louis Stevenson endured.  And, without his wife he probably wouldn't have lived as long as he did.  The story from her perspective took a dark turn near the end which was a surprise too."
0,"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far. Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want. The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

0,"Exceptional price and performance.  Use it for my tiny V911 and Propel Speed King helis that enables superior control although more sensitive and responsive to the stock controls.  Very easy to bind with the button on the back of the device.  Much cheaper, superior functionality (bells and whistles) and equal quality to my more expensive DX6i used for a Spectrum radio Blade 200 SRX heli.  Oh yeah, sadly, the great FlySky uses another 2.4 protocol that won't work with Spectrum ESC (radio receiver)."

0,"This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word ""playing"" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.  The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.  This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too!"
0,"I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.  The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.  One star taken off for the price, which seems way too high for what the product consists of."
0,"Good price for the size. You can't go wrong with f10. I use it as a daily disinfectant and as a cleaner. It's safe, so you can use it on the cage while your bird is still in it, just make sure to remove any food and water first. It doesn't have a chemical smell and was shipped carefully."

But this food has a lot of creamy gravy in it which he loves and medications are easily crushed into it without changing the taste. The chicken is tender so he can chew it. There are not a lot of by products in it, only what any cat needs to thrive. I love the fact that you can buy individual flavors on Amazon. Most stores only sell the mixed flavor boxes. Our kitty only likes the chicken flavor so this is handy. Unfortunately our baby won't be here much longer but while he is, I'm treating him to the best I can find...And this is it!"

0,"I love sandals, especially since I live in the Phoenix area where it is sandal weather nearly year-round.  I have many, many brands of sandals from cheapie flip-flops to expensive dressy low-heel sandals, to go with all manner of clothing, casual to classy. However, I think I have found my perfect sandal with these!  Comfort, style and support - all-in-one.  I have a casual colored pair now, but can easily state that other colors will meet the nearly classy mode for slack outfits.  I have a high in-step and these sandals support every millimeter of my soles. The adjustable straps would allow for wider feet, although with my narrow feet, I could easily want a bit more tighter fit; however, foot movement is minimal due to  tri-band construction of these beautiful sandals. My new goal is to begin the process of getting these sandals in all the colors that fit my clothing/color style...which may be all of them!!!!  PROs: Little to no break-in time required!!! Honest! Great fit with adjustable straps...all three straps! Excellent supporting foot-bed. Quality materials.  Love the leather smell! Flexibility. Sandal can flex in perfect harmony with natural body movement. Sole - perfect on all surfaces! Decorative medallions and bead - adds a touch of fun! Fit - true to size...I wear a 6.5 - 7.0 and a 7 was just slightly bigger as I would expect in a quality shoe that comes only in whole sizes. Love the mixed colored selections and the metallic leather choices!  CONs: None....I tried very hard to find a negative in these sandals but could not come up with one.  Oh, perhaps I wish there were even more colors!  Patent black leather, cream, silver, light blue..."

0,"We stayed here for one night, and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest. We found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this - @ $200 for the night. We felt when we checked in that if you weren't with the conference, then why were we staying in the hotel. The guy at the main door didn't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby, we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in. We were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through, I was just short of being asked why didn't I bring my lap-top with me so I could use the Internet access in the room.... !!

0,"My ferret loves this Vitamin Supplement! I love this product and have purchased it for almost 5 years and will continue to purchase it for the well-being of my girl.  I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.  This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.  What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.  I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too."

The location is great, right on the Magnificent Mile and so close to major attractions. My suite was well appointed and very clean. I even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn't find any. The hotel is very luxurious. The sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable. The next time I travel to Chicago, I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental again."

0,"My significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said, 'I wish we could stay longer'. That good! The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. Everything is high tech. Plasma TV, CD/Radio, Projection alarm clock (love that so much bought one today). If you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. They even have a four legged friend menu. The bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided. The bed was the best in a hotel ever. Linens were crip, white and fresh. Maid service twice daily with turn down service. Safe in room, ice delivered, iron, hairdryer all top of the line. The filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor. Mid-century style with funky chair/ottman, cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The library, free internet access, in room wifi were extras we didn't expect . Bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby. Funky artwork. Location, location, location. The best place we've ever stayed not only in Chicago. Highly recommend."

It was an interesting story, and I can't wait to get my hands on it. I loved the characters, and the writing was very good. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

0,"My golden retriever makes an ""mmmmm""sound when she is waiting for me to hand her a favorite treat.  She sat and started ""mmmmmmm"" before I even go the bag open for these goodies!  These are definitely a new favorite. The dogs like the flavor and I like them for two more reasons.  One is that they are soft, so my (greedy) labs don't choke on them.  The second reason is that you can break them into smaller pieces for training sessions and they don't just turn into crumbs like some treats do.  They are perfect for this.  I will be buying more of these! MMMMMMMM!"

0,"I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.  An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home. I also thought it was worth renting a post hole digger, I wanted it deep, I knew the roadbed was close (no curb here), and I wanted to save time."

It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel (great excuse to catch up on some movies) The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice. The service was top notch. Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty. The Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing. Chicago remains tied with London as my favourite city.

0,"I've long loved the Sister Arnold series but this one was just too much to stomach. It's preachy, that looooong section on England's foxhunt had zip to do with the story and was a personal argument from the author.  Second, I found myself pitying the one character the reader was meant to hate--- this character was far more interesting than the good guys. As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel. The animals were wonderful but there wasn't enough of them. I found myself getting irritated as I read Hounds and the Fury and had to force myself to finish it. Will I buy the next book? Maybe, if I find it used somewhere and even then, only if it's super cheap."
1,"We will not be back to this hotel. There are several reasons for this, but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. The room was OK, but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly, and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. They didn't offer any other solutions. The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. Overall, we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago."

1,"I purchased the Coolaroo Elevated Core for my cat and it is a nice size for him.  It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not easy to adjust.  It does not stay on very well.  I will be replacing it for the next cat.  I have the most trouble with the plastic clasp on the top of the collar.  I have had to use a different clasp on the top because it is hard to see the clasp on the collar.  I have tried other brands, but they all seem to have just the same problem.  I am having trouble adjusting the collar because it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I was worried about my cat getting too close to the collar and getting it to go in the air.  It is very easy to adjust and I would recommend it.  I have a very hard time getting my cat to use it.  I would recommend this collar for a very hard and experienced cat.  If your cat is a big chewer, it is probably worth it.  I was very disappointed in this collar because the size was too large.  It is made from plastic and it is a bit difficult to put on, but it is perfect for my cat.  It is very soft and my cat is a little bit fussy.  I was surprised by the quality of the collar.

0,"Just finished reading Primacy of Darkness (Brooklyn Shadows Book 3) by Brock Deskins. This was a wild ride from Book 1 throughout and ending with Book 3. I must say this was my favorite of the 3. The first 2 Books set us up for the climatic energy in Book 3. I really liked that all the characters from previous books play a continued part in the ending of this Trilogy. Incredibly imagined, yet believable character. Imagine if you will,  Jack the Ripper returning to modern times as a vampire in Brooklyn, New York! If you cannot make that leap let Brock make it for you and take this journey along with Leo, Kat, Marvin, Vincent, Trinh, Carol and a motley crew of vampires, werewolves, bloodlings and humans good and evil on this amazing adventure. I look forward to reading much more of Brocks work in the future.  Synopsis (from back cover): Jack the Ripper, sadistic madman of old London, once thought long dead, has returned to New York in an effort to quench his thirst for blood and mayhem. When the city's vampire enclave finds itself insufficient to deal with a madman of Jack's caliber, Vincent, the enclave head, enlists Leo Malone to put the maniac down before he reveals the existence of vampires as he throws the city into the throes of chaos and terror. Leo soon finds that Jack is not the only monster with which he must contend. A ghost from his past has also seemingly crawled from its grave and seeks to put an end to him and the rest of his kind."

I had to replace the motion sensor light with a ""turn off"" switch that allows the lights to turn on and off at the same time.  The lights are also not designed to be used as a motion sensor light.  The motion sensor lights are a little light-weight and just a tad cumbersome to use.  The motion sensor lights are a good value for the price.I bought this for a friend who has a house, he loves it, and is very pleased with it.  It is easy to install and it has the right"
1,"SPOILERS-  I really liked this book and the characters. I will admit that I was a bit nervous about reading this book. I am not going to tell you what to expect, but I will say that this book was good.  The characters are well developed and the storyline is full of action.  I liked the fact that they were all over the place.  I also liked that there was a lot of romance and there was an interesting story line.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for"

0,"I Moved a few years ago and my spring-form pan left me for parts unknown. So I got another one and price was on my mind.  Hey, they all leak at this price range.  Simple to take care of, use shortening like caulking and seal the inner rim and especially where the side is connected, crimped, whatever.  This is great for regular cake batter.  Also, I use a cooking or roasting bag on the outside when making cheesecake.  Just slip in the bag and cut to size.  No muss, no fuss.  I use a razor cutter to trim along the edge.  *** Update 3/3/2016 Found a non bath cheesecake recipe and made it in this pan.  Don't have to worry about leaks.  Here it is New York Cheesecake. 2 pounds cream cheese 3/4 cup white sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 cup sour cream 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 6 tablespoons melted butter 1/4 cup white sugar Directions 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). 2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes. 3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust. 4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping. Upgraded to 5 stars because of this recipe!"

0,"AMERICAN SNIPER begins with Kyle's first sniper kill and then follows his path from childhood all the way through his enlistment until he leaves the Navy in 2009. Reading about the way Kyle grew up and the life he led before becoming a SEAL really gives insight into what sort of person it takes to be a special forces operator. Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a ""good ol' boy"". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing. The autobiography is broken up into chapters with sub-chapters, making for quick easy reading and the tone of the narrative is so laid back that it's really more like having a conversation than reading. I love this book."
1,i did not enjoy this book. It was a good read. I would recommend it.
0,"I bought this especially for the backlit feature so I can find the buttons in the dark. Unfortunately, the backlight only stays on a few seconds after you press any button. There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.  This remotes costs a lot more than a non-backlit version of the same thing, the RC71, without the B, about 6 times as much."
0,"I read this book as a teen-ager and was constantly putting it down because it was making me so nervous. I saw even then, at a young age, how possible it was for this world to become a reality. How many people try to lose themselves in drugs, alcohol, meaningless TV? We are closer to this Brave New World than we like to admit. Can this insanity our world is headed toward be stopped? I don't know but I fear that Huxley understood the human conditon all too well. We believe everything we hear on TV or read in the newspapers. Too many of us have left our intelligence and perception at the door. Wake up before it is too late and think for yourself. There was a version of Brave New World with Leonard Nimoy which presented a sort of happy ending for two people, which did not occur in the book but still leaves the Brave New World untouched. I won't say too much about John ""the Savage"" who was more human than the rest of the population but he is the mirror Huxley uses to show us how barren and sterile this Brave New World is. A place where every word can be uttered except mother and father. Children are born in laboratories. The family unit has been disassembled with all loyalty going to the state. As frightening as it is, it a must read for those who want to understand what is happening now and how easily it can happen. The question becomes: do we rule technology or do we allow it to rule us?"

The little girl lives in an apartment in the city, the mother initially rejects the teddy bear because he's missing a button in the store, etc.  If it's possible for a book to be both realistic AND whimsical, this one did it."

I bought this based on my good experience and all the good reviews but I have to say Ms James couldn't decide what story she was telling.  Was it John and Rylynn...?  Kyle and Rylynn...Dex? Rae?  Jordon...the father?  Cameron?  There were so many sub plots going on and nothing was satisfying.  Very disappointing.  I'll have a hard time trying another one."

The bag now clearly states they're made in China.  I decided to let my dog eat these but not to reorder since I only want products exclusively made in the USA, and my dog doesn't even really like them as much, so I'm going to end up throwing away more than half of the bag.

0,"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park."" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny ""insipid""! I love the other novels, even the underrated ""Lady Susan,"" but I could not finish this one.  Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park-1999/dp/6305907145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park (1999)</a>. Frances O'Connor creates a spunky, witty version of Fanny Price that deviates from the novel and is all the better for it."

Her lashes were so huge so I trimmed them down a bit so it looks much better, make up is nice, I love the outfit, great detail and fabric used, boots are cute, I like her two bracelets. She does NOT come with a comb. Her necklace is gold with painted on blue stones. Her bag is suede. Overall glad I got her"
