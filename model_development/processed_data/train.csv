0,"I like how this book picks up right where the first book left off. I enjoyed it more than the first book and was very surprised on how Jenny Lynne made it work. I really didn't know how it was going to work out. As usual, the characters are their awesome selves. The book was filled with betrayal, action, and drama worth reading. I was satisfied with the ending of the pretend story told in the hospital room and the actual story. It made me hopeful for a better future to make the sacrifice worth it. The book held my attention the whole way through. I'm not really sure what else to say. I really thought it was well put together."

0,"If talking dragons with attitude interest you, you will enjoy this book.  I got hooked on the character of Temeraire, the dragon who is very intelligent and concerned about the conditions under which all dragons have to live.  The writing was not always the best, but I liked it enough to buy all the books and read them all."
0,"I love these things, and have been giving them as gifts to various nieces and nephews. I like to keep my electronics gathered in one of these pouches- also for storage purposes I fold, shawls, ponchos and wraps in one to travel with.  When I pack, I used one for slieeping attire, undergarments, and socks.  I also, tend to pack my more atheletic garments into one bag, so they are at the ready when when I want them and not sloshing around with my business attire."
1,"Nice product. Not too big or too small, just good enough."
0,"Excellent Product for mounting your cell phone to the wall, plenty of room even if your cell phone is in its case. Can be used for all cell phones. Just make sure you read the directions FIRST. But beware unless you have smooth walls it will not adhere, I have rough stucco walls in most of my house and paneling in another part and it will not stick properly. To over come this problem I used Blank Outlet covers made of plastic and than screwed the covers to the wall and installed this product to the blank covers, this method works good for iPhone 4 & 5 and similar sized phones. I know most homes are just sheet-rocked walls and it will work fine."

0,"We have a couple of ISI whip cream chargers.  In the past, we have mainly used the ISI cartridges.  We decided to try the Purist cartridges because of the big price discount.  Based on about 15 cartridges used so far, we've had perfection operation.  The ISI cartridges were sometimes difficult to puncture, requiring pliers and a protective wrap to tighten the cap enough to penetrate the cartridge.  So far, all the Purist cartridges have penetrated easily and have fully charged the dispensers."

It's not waterproof so it will be hard to hold on to.  I received a free sample for review purposes. I'm very happy with it.I've had this for about a year now and I love it.  The color temperature is a perfect match for my mood and I love it.  The color temperature is really nice and warm.  I just wish the temperature was more like 110.  I do like that it doesn't have a light bulb which is nice.  The light output is also nice.  It's only one bulb and I like it.  I wish the light bulb was brighter but the light output is nice.  I just wish the bulb was not as bright.  I also wish the bulb was brighter.  I bought a couple of these for my son who uses the bathroom and they are great.

0,"It contains accurate info but the info it contains is so broad that it skims over most of US History--I guess a textbook is supposed to to that in a general sense, but as a professor I found it lacking and wouldn't have chose this one for my course. I see that it comes with nice online components and is fairly modern but as a student reading it for a self-propelled style course that I took for fun I found that many of the test questions weren't even in this material and I could read it and not know about more than half of what I read. I did appreciate details that weren't in the textbooks of the 1990's like union strikes and monopoly dealings and a greater emphasis on race relations in mining and Native American dealings (more history being revealed) but over all I found the book a bit boring and strangely organized and lacking in depth.-- It jumps too fast post 1900 onward.--It seems to be cramming more history into the same length of textbook these days is their solution to the problem of more and more history being revealed, but I found it more of a problem. 2.5 stars."

0,"My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. I'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. At check-in, I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile. It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush. Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. Our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large 'living room' and a large bedroom. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. If I would have payed full price for this suite, I probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here, I decided to give it a five. It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. We found the food and service mediocre. The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the 'Sinatra Booth' which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. The Ambassador East is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. The staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. When we are in Chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again."
0,"My family and I have just had a two week holiday in Chicago, and we stayed for a week at the Hilton Towers. We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel. The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. Tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place!"

It is a good read, but it is not one of my favorite books. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great story with some interesting characters.

0,"This book was raw with emotion from page 1 and starts from after that awful day that changed Diana from the carefree person she was to a person who struggles daily with demons.  You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all of his own demons he fought the hardest for Diana.  We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.  As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.  He is also trying to deal with the fact that he was unable to save her.  Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.  Gideon and Dianas relationship continues to grow, helps both of them heal with the aftermath of that day.  In the end they both were each others saviors."

0,"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...  This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.  There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.  My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.  Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.  My twenty year old bowls look brand new, even after 20 years of dishwasher abuse.  Whereas, my week old Indipets bowl is ALREADY scratched, falling apart and has pinched my finger so hard I still have a huge blood blister on my finger.."

0,"A disappointment to say the least. I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out! I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night. The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card, since they do indeed take American Express. I couldn't wait to get there! We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3:00 on Saturday afternoon. Me, the tourist, I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding. We get in the line to check in. I give them the gift card and my check card. They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate, but for incidentals as well. We give them a credit card instead. While in line checking in, we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like. The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man. Someone's luggage has been lost. He desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see. Not impressed. We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see. The rooms on the website looked glorious! My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room. The sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room. Yuck. We stay the night and go to check out in the morning. Again, I give them the American Express gift card. The clerk says 'their system usually doesn't take them'. I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday. He swipes the card and bam! it works! What do you know?? He was so rude. I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. Such a disappointment!"

0,"In ""His (A Dark Erotic Romance Novel)"" we meet Kat and Gavriel. Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.  The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.  Overall, a recommended read."

One block from the beach and public transportation is right there. Incredible area to explore. I highly recommend the Ambassador East"

I am a 32 year old man who works at a large company and have had no issues with these gloves. I have had no issues with the gloves falling apart or breaking. They are the most comfortable I have ever worn and I am so happy with them. I recommend them to anyone looking for a glove that will last a long time. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend these gloves to anyone looking for a great glove. These are super lightweight and lightweight. I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality product.

All service was very fast and through. The lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it, the bar service was good. The drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar. I got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $400.00 for a 5 star hotel that's cheap.

Counterclockwise for coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.  It's a fine piece of equipment.  The plastic top is such a good fit it's not easy to pry off.

I like that the toy itself is sturdy and that the pieces are easy to assemble.  I love that it comes with a small plastic holder that holds it together.  I love that the toy has a tiny guide that helps you figure out what the directions are and to make the pieces fit into the container.  It's also a good quality toy that my little one can"

0,"The Unique 2nd Birthday Latex Balloon 6-pack arrived very quickly from the seller in professional packaging.  The package included six 12-inch diameter latex balloons in various colors that were printed with ""Happy 2nd Birthday"".  The only challenge I have learned with purchasing balloons online is finding somewhere to get them inflated.  I was able to find a grocery store here in town to finally do it, but it was definitely more expensive than just purchasing from them or pretty much anywhere else.  These balloons were not expensive, it was the getting them inflated with helium that got costly.  I think it was like $1.60 per balloon.  Overall, the quality and appearance of the balloons was nice.  I would definitely recommend these balloons, but be forewarned that you may run into more expense than you anticipated with inflating them.  The inflating cost is not a problem with the balloons...just what you run into when trying to get them filled."

She doesn't even notice the difference and they are all now mixed with the Legos. The Lego kits are starting to become way too expensive and my daughter loves creating different things with Legos. So we will still buy different kits every once in a while. But will definitely be buying more Building Bricks for her and for when my son becomes old enough to play with legos."

A bit of romance thrown, and very well written. (I cannot say that about some books I have read). More is left to the imagination, To me that is a far more ""sexy"" than having it spelled out in words. Anxiously awaiting the next in this series."
0,"Awesome kit, simple yet fun at the same time. Absolutely love the Twin Drive system, and how it's just as posable and articulate as the figure itself. One minor nitpick is that the GN swords don't hold up nicely when placed in the hands, they are loose and will fall out when trying to pose this figure. Other than that, it's a really awesome figure, easy to put together, and overall the product is great. If you love and are a hardcore fan of Gundam, get this and add it to your collection. Highly recommend it."

That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.  Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.  Highlights . . . ------------------------------------------------------------------ '' Heavy Duty Solid Die-cast Aluminum. '' Dual Bowl design, 1 for Lime, 1 for Lemon. '' Color coded for Lime & Lemon.  I have uploaded some Images and Video to Amazon that might not show up right away.

Had problems getting to customer service but when we did get them tech was nice and very helpful.  He had me do a Hard Reset.  It worked....until six hours later and it went back to turning on by itself.  I really wanted this set but in the end it was too much of a hassle.  I read many reviews and chose it for cost and star ratings.  We must have gotten one of the few lemons.  I would only recommend this set if you are buying from Amazon as they were great with return."

So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone  The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.  Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."

I'm very sure that its from this device and not the bluetooth headphones. I use the headphones very regularly. The humming sounds I suppose can be ignored because once the sound starts playing you don't hear it. But then there is a delay in the sound. I think it's about half a second (or maybe 300ms) which is pretty bad. Bad enough that you can't really watch TV like that. Considering the quality of sound, the delay and the background humming, its not worth the price.  I haven't tried other products so I don't know if this is a standard problem with all Bluetooth Tx."

It is flattering and fits me just right but since it is flowy and has a little stretch, I don't have to worry about feeling uncomfortable if I gain or lose a couple lbs before I have to wear this dress out. I do agree with other reviewers that I would not go braless in this as it is a bit low-cut but the design of the sleeves and back make this not a problem as a bra can easily be worn without showing. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4).

0,I have 3 Male Italian Greyhounds who have very hard to fit body shapes. If you can make a few quick stitches you can make the Gooby fit like a glove. The Gooby has an open V neck. I lay one side of the V over the other side of the V.  I then sew it together making it fit their skinny necks.  This also keeps the Gooby from sliding back next to their penis. This prevents the Male IG from peeing on their Gooby.  I use their Girth (chest) measurement to purchase the correct size. I will attach a picture of my Gooby already sew together.

It was easy to set up and between the 2g and 5g bands, we are getting a strong signal in all parts of the house. The wifi is faster and more reliable than ever. My only gripe is that the router itself is kind of a beast and has to sit out in the open, instead of tucking away. But at least it is sleek looking."

0,The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.  Overall though it is a a very good machine though.

1,"I made my reservation at the Hilton Chicago believing I was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. Unfortunately, my stay at the Hilton Chicago went downhill from the moment I checked in. There was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. Once I finally got checked in and located my room, I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. Finally I made it into my room. It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. The manager moved me into a new room, so I can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. Finally settled, I was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. That is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call I had not requested! Needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and I will choose other accommodations for my next trip to Chicago."

0,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.  My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.  This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.  UPDATE I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"

It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a sleeping bag. It is very light and you can put it in the back of your car or in your car seat. It's also very warm and easy to use. The hammock is made of sturdy material and is durable. We are not sure if it is a perfect hammock but it is a great hammock. We have a 5 year old and this is the perfect hammock for him.

0,"This is really the absolute best piece of glass in the price range. People comparing it to scopes that cost two or three times as much are missing the picture. You just aren't going to find a Mil/Mil FFP scope with usable glass at this price from anyone else.  The picture is bright, clear, and distortion free. The reticule is straight, perfectly centered, and sharp. The turrets are very good, with the smallest amount of wiggle but nothing that matters. The whole thing is very solid, with firm, positive adjustment at the eyepiece.  At the highest powers you do get a bit of haze, but nothing that renders it unusable. The range I usually shoot at is frequently overcast, and even in less than ideal light I've never had a problem with contrast, even with the magnification set to maximum (14x).  It has held zero through approximately 900 rounds of .308 with no signs of problems.

0,"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY."

0,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.  The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)  I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.  The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

0,"This hat goes perfectly with the ""queen of hearts"" costume. It adds some cute flare for pictures. However, it did not work to wear the hat all night. The hat portion slides onto a headband. The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely. The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."

The view was great, the location was prime. The staff was helpful. The room was large (we had 2 double beds). I only have one complaint. Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (I think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. Fortunately, the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. It was just a little weird. Overall, a great stay and I will definitely stay there again."

0,"This is a very long and heavy rope and you can definitely feel the effect of carrying out any of the exercises in the following day or so. There are quite a few varied exercises to try and they are easy to learn. It seems that the focus is on the upper body so I'm not sure you'll end up looking like the people pictured on the box. Still, it's a fairly intense workout and certainly makes a welcome change to using the machines at the gym.  My only criticism is that you need a considerable amount of space to really use the rope effectively.

1,"This film was originally conceived as a satire on the ""White Queen"" who is the daughter of the wealthy and powerful woman, the Queen.  The film was shot in a very large city with many beautiful women.  The film was shot in the spirit of ""The White Queen"" with no racial or gender differences.  The film is about the rise of the female monarch, the Queen, and the Queen's rise to power.  The Queen's rise to power is not based on the fact that she is a woman, but rather on the fact that she is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful man.  The film does not attempt to challenge the notion that the White Queen is a woman, but rather to examine the relationship between the Queen and the wealthy and powerful.  The film does attempt to show that the Queen is not the daughter of a wealthy man, but rather is the daughter of a powerful man.  The Queen's rise to power is not based on the fact that she is the daughter of a wealthy man, but rather is the daughter of a"

1,"One reviewer said it is a little too wide, but I will admit that it is a pretty sturdy piece. I had to cut a bit to get the top to be a little tighter but it worked well. It was a breeze to assemble. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great stainless steel dishwasher. I did have to make sure the lid was a little longer than intended for my purposes, but I am happy with the finish. I like that the dishwasher does not come with a sink holder. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great dishwasher.I bought this to replace a old that was broken in the middle of the night.  It was fairly easy to clean and to assemble.  I can't think of a better design for a shower curtain.  It is sturdy, holds a lot of water and is a good size"

1,"Staying at the Hard Rock Hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling. I stayed at this one the last time I visited Chicago and it was just wonderful. The rooms are amazing and the one I stayed in had a great view of the city. The beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat, the Wi-Fi was really fast and always available and I liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones. I didn't have the chance to use the spa, but I could tell it was really nice and relaxing. I did go to the Base Bar a couple times for a drink, very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from. The Rock shop was pretty cool too and I bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends. Overall I think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in, the experience is definitely different than any other hotel I've stayed in."

I opened the second one to find the same thing.. dangerous...  I was able to cut and rewire them and no problems since.. I tossed one out in favor of a larger clip lamp from lowes which i would recommend over these due to the better quality, longer plug, higher wattage, and lower price."

He is always a bit cold so I can't get him to be too warm.  He has great upper body strength and will pull up to a 40 degree.  He likes that he can carry around his phone, keys, and other stuff.  I use this with my pack, camping, and other gear.  I like that it has a couple of pockets for some tools and a small storage pouch for some other stuff.  I also like that it is easy to carry around and move around.  It has a little loop on the side for the tools and a small pocket in the middle for the phone.  I recommend this for anyone who is a backpacker, who wants a more compact pack.I love this mat.  I have been using it for several months and it seems to be holding up great.

0,"It fits my camera like a glove, it is not real leather which I like.  I love the light brown color and how protective it is.  The only thing is that when I carry around my neck or shoulder, I keep the cover off, completely off  because it won't just hang, it will fall off, so I keep cover in my purse, and then just carry camera with the main attachment all day when using it.  I wish the cover didn't just fall off...but having the camera so well attached to the main body is super convenient you just pull up point and shoot and let hang again, it won't fall....I get a lot of compliments"

1,"The ripple rug deserves more attention. The design is very good and easy to use. I just wish the two adjustable sides were a little larger. The ring is a little too large and the color is a little too deep. I would buy it again if I could.The cats have been feeding this to them for years and it has been great.  They love it and I love that it is made from organic cotton.  I am very pleased with this product.  I will be ordering another one of these for the future.I've been using this product for about a year now and it has really helped my dog.  It's been working great.  It's not a full-on cream and does a good job of keeping my dog's coat shiny and shiny.  I've noticed a huge difference with the dog's coat.

Then, if that were not enough to deal with, the blade is not sharp (very hard to cut soft wood like pine). After much effort I was able to get some limited use out of it, but had by best success using a rasp type Plane and a sander."

After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived, never under 10 min. even late at night. I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband... 1 margarita was $14! I wans't drinking because I'm pregnant so I had a soda water for $4... if I would have known I would have had tap water. Overall... great rooms, OK staff , horrible elevators, overpriced drinks."

I hope it is a good one for all of us who have been involved in the military for decades. I have a hard time putting down this book. I loved it."

I would definitely buy this one again. I'm happy with the quality of the pants. I did get a free shipping on this purchase. These are great. They are great for running and hiking. I am on my feet all day long and these have not hurt my feet. I'm going to order a half size larger for my feet.
1,"This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be. The website and it's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in. The amenities were not what I was looking for, and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there, but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service. I don't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon."

0,"This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.  The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.  While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike."

0,"Review is based on only one use in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, at the Eben Ice Caves.  These cleats work very good on the ice.  Sizing is just right: I purchased a Large, for a size 10.5 men's winter hiking boot. Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.  I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.  The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.  I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did."
0,Light weight - meaning a little flimsy - but decent all around. The cup threaded up to my binks model 7 and Devilviss JGA spray guns. I sprayed a lottle last evening with it to test it out. It came with a fine wire strainer on the pickup tube. The cup is thin and should be treated carefully. There is no reinforcing base ring like most high quality cups. It sealed easy and the quick connect worked well. Good cheap cup.

0,"For anyone who has ever been in the military, this book is a vivid remembrance of past experiences. For those who served in Vietnam, it is a painful revisiting of a tour of duty that should never have happened. As I read the book and reflected on my own tour in Vietnam in 1968-69, the pain, fear, anger and confusion came rushing back. My life has been forever changed because of the experience as Im sure is the case with many others. The vivid experiences of Shawn McClellan serve as a portrayal of the Vietnam vets emotions. Thanks for validating my feelings. In some small way, it helps."

0,"As appealing as the ""guitarcentric"" cover might be, this book by Alan Paul not only relates a magical musical experience, but also recounts everyday events experienced by an expatriate in this gargantuan land. The character of the Chinese people and their complex culture comes through well in this part travel book and part musical memoir. It makes for a fascinating read and would most appeal to those who have picked up a guitar and, at some time, dreamed of being on stage. (Of course that includes all of us who have picked up a guitar."
0,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".   Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.   The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).   All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."
0,"From the very beginning of this series, I knew that Gretchen de la O had given us a gem. What I hadn't expected was the respectful, slow and magical transition from YA to more Adult. You literally feel like you are growing up with Wilson Mooney, our heroine of the series.  In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.  The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.  However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.  A beautiful series written for the hopeless romantic in all of us, Gretchen does not disappoint with the HEA and delivers a book boyfriend the teenage girl and young lady in all of us dreamed existed."

I still don't understand what the 5v charger input is supposed to do or why the ""Select"" button doesn't select. Also, I don't need to use the remote control (I already have a handful of remotes and don't want to juggle another). It seemed to take forever to get the switcher, but considering the price and the utility of the thing, I am a happy buyer."

0,I loved this book I started reading while I was at work and then continued when I got home and before I knew it it was 5am.  It is a love story that really fits in this day and age especially with the way things are going in today's times.

The small town contractor is down on love till he meets the new lady that has moved to town and he goes from playboy to loverboy without even realizing it.
0,"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.  Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.  Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.  Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.  Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.  This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other."

My daughter is still very young and still gets frustrated with it. I think it's a great toy and I think it's great for kids. I would not buy it again. It's just a good toy for young kids. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this. He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood. It does not come with any batteries and I can tell that it has had a few bad breaks and some slight splinters. But I'm happy with the purchase."

0,"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.  These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.  The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.  Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family."

0,"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.  You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it. And really, I am not overly into politics, but I know that by supporting this travesty of a man and his pushy attitude the United States of America is sending the world the wrong kind of message."

I didn't think Dr. Williams could disgust or creep me out anymore than he has, but he did!  He truly is a really dark, horrible person.  Meg keeps evolving and she is getting scary with the amount of power she is gaining. Thankfully her faith is keeping her grounded!  Farrow and Gavil really surprised me, in a good way, on the parts they played in this book.  Creed continues his awesomeness, but I wish he didn't have amnesia.  Hopefully he gets his memories back.  I was mad at Cole though.  He was so selfish!  Maze is always amazing, and the brothers and mom are wonderful."

Regardless of how you may feel about Iraq this book explains the day to day struggle that was the reality of this conflict and how it interacted with Afghanistan.  I was impressed with the involvement that President Obama had with getting Bin Laden.  I had always assumed that it just happened on his watch, but he was much more deeply involved than I thought.  I'll give him credit for that, but not much else.  The way Obama grinds though flag officers makes me wonder how much longer the military system will continue to produce the highly competent high level Generals and Admirals we must have to stay safe in a world that seems to hate us for who we are.  Thankfully there are people like Bob Gates who will lead and endure the realities of public life for the sake of our country."

1,"Due to the circumstances and the financial problems with the film, it's difficult to imagine what the film is going to be like. The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent. The film also has a very good cast, and it has a very good ending. I think the ending is a good one, and I'm not sure if that's because it's a good ending, or if it's just because it's the ending. I think the ending is a little confusing, and that's what makes it a little more confusing. If you want to see a movie that is full of action and laughs, I recommend this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one. I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action. It's a good movie, but not one that you'll be very happy with. It's a lot of fun to watch and there is a lot of action in it. The plot is a bit complex, but I really enjoyed it. The acting is excellent and the plot is a bit convoluted. It's not a bad movie, but if you're not a fan of action, don't watch it."

0,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.  Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:  - The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.  - The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.  - The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.  - The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.  - Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."

It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.  Anyway, overall, this is a very worthy purchase.  It actually has a bit of room for his feet to grow into which is nice for it means that he will be able to use these for a longer period of time. I was able to get this very nice item on a discount and I am glad to share to you all as well my fair and honest feedback about it.

We reserved a King Suite, and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front. Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch, he offered us a free breakfast, but would not up-grade our room. The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni. We will not be retuning to this Hotel again."
1,"Swissotel Chicago: Don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. This hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. Firstly, the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. For example, the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view. The bedroom bed (King-sized) makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. Of coarse, this isn't too bad once you fall asleep, until then, it sucks! In regards to room services, the hotel workers are not all that friendly. They talk to you in a stubborn way, as if they just want to get it done and over with, just to get their pay-check. Yes they do all basic room service orders, but it is not all too friendly. Overall, this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has (which is a bare minimum). With that being said, I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. However, if sub-par service and quality is okay for you, then this hotel could be suitable, however, considering it's prices, you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms."

I put a few drops on her ear and it worked very well. She was very happy with it. I would definitely recommend this product to any dog owner. I have a 15 pound Yorkie mix. She is a bit smaller than most dogs, but she is still a little bit on the small side, so I thought she would be fine. She's a bit bigger than most dogs, but she is still a little on the small side.

It's very gentle on his skin, and it really helps him stay on his feet, he doesn't slip down and it's a great quality product. My dog loves this product. I love this product! I use it as a pet carrier and a walker. The dog is very secure and comfortable and the way the collar locks is very secure. It's easy to put on, very secure.

0,"Some serial characters don't hold up well after repeated exposure. They become a bit stale, too predictable, but Jack Reacher? Never! Lee Child is way too good at this game. He sets the hook then leaves little bits here and there, some obvious, some not so, but all keep the reader saying ""OK, just a few more pages,"" then a few more, and a few more. The narrative is first person Reacher, and strictly linear. There are subplots galore, but the straightforward style makes them easy to follow. At the outset, Reacher enters the Pentagon with a target on his back. He's in uniform, an MP major, but scruffy, needs a haircut and a shave. He's posted to Kelam, a Ranger Base south of Tennessee where a young woman has been murdered, her throat slashed in military fashion. If this turns out to be a soldier killing, things will go very bad for the base and its in habitants. Reacher has an opposite number on the inside, Major Munro, also MP, but Reacher works, as always, on the outside. He contacts the local sheriff, a stunning young woman who complicates his job by spotting him immediately. She's done similar work with the Marine Corps, but has made little progress solving the murder. Reacher does his work in his own way, as usual, playing within the rules but just barely. I'll leave the rest of the plot description to the reader. No need to spoil someone else's fun. In the end, as usual, Reacher leaves town, mission accomplished, a beautiful sheriff pining for him but knowing he's not a man who stays in one place for any longer than necessary. Vintage Child, a master of his craft."

Her vivid descriptions and down to earth storytelling transported me to Jersey alongside the characters.  Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.  This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down.  I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better.  Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.  As a whole, this was a fantastic novel that wrapped up this series nicely.  Im definitely sad to have hit the end of the Wilde brothers saga, but it was a fantastic journey while it lasted.  Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."

It does not have a charger if you use it with an external power supply. The charger is very easy to use and the color is very vibrant.

0,"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.  But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.  This is a 5 star item now that I've ""fixed"" it, but as it was, because it's so very easy to lose, 3 stars."

I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. I was looking forward to reading the book, but the last part was so repetitive that I didn't get into it. I'm glad it was longer, because it was well written and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book. This story was well written and the characters were believable. It's definitely a book you want to read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing."

0,"My initial review of this was very positive. We like these very much. But my daughter started developing a rash above her lip where the bottle was touching. She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:  Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed). So we are very pleased with these and bought several more after trying them out."

Each cliffhanger in the series is bigger than the last.  Jase knows who ""Sammi"" is now. How did he find out ? Will he tell Dornan? Is he truly still the boy that Juliette loved, still loves? Is he on her side?  It was like I was holding my breath with Juliette waiting for Jase to figure it out. Then he does and I felt relief and then much like Juliette I felt despair at the consequences now that Jase knows. What a roller coaster ride of emotions!  Lili St. Germain knows how to tell a gripping story that's for sure.  Moved right on to the next book."

0,"I got this originally because I was into the Lorelei's Grasp based on reviews I read. I'd never seen a Naschy go this way or that way, and ended up watching Horror rises from the Tomb first and really dug it. If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror films from the 70s based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film looks great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fans - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scenes where he gets to paw his actresses' naked breasts every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you?  Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babes at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girls like idiots and send them back to their rooms, then shake their heads in disbelief when they're murdered two minutes later... ""we did all we could"". Some people like movies where cops are staking out a school being attacked nightly by a monster, and then one of the girls complains there's breathing in her room and the cops just think she's imagining it and then act surprised an hour later when she's dead -- oh those hysterical women! At least that's how I remember it. You get the idea though. Eventually there's a twisted dark reflection of THE LITTLE MERMAID's trans-species / terrain love affair and a cool underwater cavern lair."

0,"The author may have gotten some tips from those classic MasterCard commercials which illustrate that money can buy some things, but certain moments and life experiences are ""priceless.""  Through the beautifully and simply illustrated tale of friendship between a cat and a dog (the interspecies metaphor alludes to openness and acceptance of differing points of view and experiences), we learn that material possessions and tangible items are sometimes not as meaningful as the space between two individuals, people, living beings, etc.  It is the unspoken, uncategorizable, sublime moments of life that are most fulfilling and rewarding, and the hardest to capture or describe.  Therefore, when trying to convey the depth of meaning of these moments, we cannot, and therefore, should not even bother trying (to encapsulate them, try as we may through photographs, video, blogging, etc.).  The best gift is one that one already has the power to give oneself--the gift of friendship, self-awareness/mindfulness and the ability to honor and nurture the two."

The rooms, while not large by any means, were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable. My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered. As for me, I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile. The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site.

0,"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it."

0,"Acorn Media has provided the DVD with english subtitles which are helpful not only to people who have hearing impediments but to foreigners (specially when politician explain very quickly intricate schemes, with names of men we know nothing about). The story is very interesting from an historical point of view. It begins with Napoleon III being dismissed and ends some times after the Second World War is over. Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fights against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every days life is a sort of thrilling gambling. For instance, he resigns his charge, thinking the government will become aware it can't do without him; in case it doesn't  Randolph will found a new Tory group, modern, kenner on social issues, and overcome the old Tory party. We see how times are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper classes are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, goes to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other women of her time. With such  ""political beasts"" as his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) was so outstanding a stateman. Love stories don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic events occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minutes were hardly enough."

0,"We adopted my our Boston Terrier puppy at almost 9 months old and she came to us having ""not been trained"" which meant that she had trained herself to, among other things, pull pull pull on her leash. Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey! There's something over there I want to smell! [yank] Oh, right..."" Small dogs, large dogs, this is what you want!"

The conversations between characters didn't feel like any conversations I have heard before, not at all believable.  Almost like reading a book badly translated from another language.  Weird.  You wanted to sympathize with Tony because he was trying to do the right things for his daughter, but his thought process didn't fit his character.  Cassi is sometimes way to flakey to be believable.  The book is rather disappointing."

People thought I had made the dress because of the quality look. It fit true to size. Only down side, the elastic at the arms is too tight. I removed the elastic & the sewing still keeps the sleeve shape but this change made it wearable for my daughter. I took  1-star off for the sleeve issue. But overall its a 5-star dress."

0,"I got this bouncer with free shipping, so very good deal. This bouncer is a nice with decent size we can put it indoor. We used electric pump and took less than 30 min to pump it. It has been in our living room for more than 2 months without the need of repumping even many kids have been to our home and played on it. It is big enough for two small kids (5 and 7 years old to play in it). We also tried filling it with 400 balls or so to let the kids to have another fun. My son has low muscle tone, at first, he scared of playing inside. Then I used a candy reward to ask him jump inside to pick it, he then have fun in picking the candy inside the bouncer. So far, all the kids (less than 7 years old) who have come to our home enjoyed this bouncer. We think this is a good buy."
0,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.  I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."
0,"Great, awesome service. Seriously, the people are amazing. That, and the nice bartender who serves after last call (at least, that's what I was told - I of course don't drink) save this place from one star. But seriously blah, small, non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $725/night, even in a major city, the rooms better be awesome. I've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $350/night. (Good thing I had a corporate rate.) And my room was not especially big, despite what the below reviews say. But here's the main problem. Even on the 10th floor, the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6, and 6:15, and 6:30, and 6:45, and 6:50, and 6:55, and...and, well, I finally got up and said screw it, let's greet the day.

Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."

Since its wider than most belts it's very roomy and I think I'm going to use it when traveling. A small money clip could hold cards and ID, leaving your valuables safe and your hands free. Kind of awesome, right?  During the day time I tend to use the black side out, but at night I turn it inside out so the pink is facing outwards. I put a couple of reflector stickers on it for extra visibility. Overall it's really well made. I can change my music through the touch screen, which is a nice feature that I can't do without now lol. The zipper is very sturdy and it doesn't slip at all during use. I've washed it a few times since I get it sweaty and there hasn't been any pilling or fading. Really happy with it. :)  I got this as part of a promo so I could share my thoughts with you."

He's exactly the type she always goes for and knows she shouldn't. Sadie gets confusing sometimes. She can't make up her mind, she runs hot and cold. It is entertaining, though. And really, I can see why she's torn. He's used to women falling at his feet and she's a challenge. I really did not want to like Heath at the beginning of the book. I didn't think it was possible.

0,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress. I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes. The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.  I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate. This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.  For reference, I am 5'3, 140lbs, 36D-29-39.  Hope this helps someone."

1,"My experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible. I went to Chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. This hotel was recommended by the wedding party. It was a terrible choice. Despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. Overall, I would say I was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. On the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. Still, I would not return here again."

0,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.  I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.  As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.  Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.  Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."
0,"Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007. Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile. Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist. Dinner at the restaurant was also good. Prices are reasonable. Room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago. Concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet."

The receptionist was rude and snobby, my room had dirty towels in it, and i found numerous small insects in my room. Furthermore, the gym and spa were closed while I was there. Nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences. Next time I will take my business elsewhere."

0,"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.    Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like."

0,"Great lead performances by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton highlight this film along with great supporting performances by Maureen Stapleton and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill.  Beatty plays journalist John Reed, a journalist very passionate about his views and was witness to the Russian Revolution in the 1910's. The movie provides insights into his idealistic views along with his romantic relationship with Louise Bryant (Keaton) whom he had a very passionate but also quite stormy relationship.  Jack nearly steals the show as O'Neill, a man very much in love with Bryant despite the fact that her heart really belongs to Reed.  And Stapleton won a well deserved Oscar as Emma Goldman, a woman who shared a lot of the same views as Reed, and initially had no use for Bryant until much later.  It's a political movie but it's also a love story and it works well with both. Definitely a must-see."

0,"This is SOOOO cute  I know, it's a footie onesie, big deal.  The colors are so rich and vibrant, and they did not fade or bleed into other items in the wash.  This is 100% organic cotton, which means it is very gently on baby, and gentle on the environment as well.  The dyes are even natural! The snaps are secure, but easy to close, and the legs snap all the way down to the foot, so it's a lot easier to put on and take off of little squirmy ones.  There are little foldover fabric covers for baby's hands to keep him/her from scratching, so you can eliminate the little mittens that don't seem to stay on.  The company guarantees satisfaction with their product, and this comes in numerous colors and several different sizes.  Since this is all cotton, there may be a bit of shrinkage, I didn't really see any, but I only washed and dried once in order to use the first time.  Since it's cotton, you can wash at high temps to completely sanitize though!!  I did receive a discount on this purchase in exchange for testing and providing an honest review for the Amazon community."
0,"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties. While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring. Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father. While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances. The remastered copy is easier on the eyes."

0,"I bought an 8 pack of these and have been replacing the CFL bulbs in the house as they burn out.  I've been much happier with these.  Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.  I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.  They have a nice glow to them rather than the harsh LED light you might be familiar with if you bought some of the earlier or cheap ones.  Try these, you'll love them, save power, and change bulbs much less often.  Win, win, win."

0,"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.  With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.  EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, yes we are using the ""Canine"" Fortiflora for our cats.

0,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!  Of course, it helps that I love Bob."
0,"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.  Pros: +The size assortment is good for many tasks + The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack. +++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great! + There are a lot of cords in the can.  Cons: - I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.  Summary:  I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip."

It not only shows how great characters change -- Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos -- but also how the entire Jedi Council is evolving downward. The beginning chapters show how far the Jedi Council has moved from a worldview of pure good vs. pure evil to one where questionable tactics are both considered and chosen. Obi Wan makes a great supporting character here. Anakin Skywalker is even more in the background, but considering his own romance (i.e. in Jedi terms, emotional attachment) with Padme, I'm sure he was taking notes from the relationship of Quinlan Vos/Asajj Ventress."

1,"Upon first inspection, Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago, but appearances can certainly be deceiving. Best summed up, Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn. It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain, even if it is an international one. The customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea. The rooms are dirty when you first walk in, the air feels stale, and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be. None of this is worth a 'luxury' price or even worthy of a 'luxury' name. I will certainly not be staying here again."

After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!  GENERAL First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!  EFFECTIVENESS We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!  WHY 5 STARS?? - Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product - Smells GREAT! - Contains no harmful chemicals!  OVERALL Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!  **UPDATE 03/2012** We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!"

0,"The Silver magic series is perhaps my favorite by this author. And this second book is the natural follow-up to the first. Everyone's favorite Dees from the first book, Glass, here has her chance to try life as a human. And she quickly lands herself in a heap of trouble, along with a romantic intrigue.  This book features the same imaginative inventiveness as the first book, and the same colorful characters. The Dees are wonderful as always. But the author's most brilliant characters, in my mind, are the Brothers Grimm. metaphysical hit men who live by their own convoluted code. This pair is calling for their own book. But let's get back to the book at hand, which is grand enough in it's own right.  I don't want to reveal too much, but if you thought the Dees were magnificent in defense of the Howard mansion, just wait until you see them turned loose in this book."

0,"This wasn't the best Robin Cook I've ever read, it wasn't even the best Robin Cook with Jack and Laurie as main characters.  But it did keep me flipping the pages to get to the climax.  Unfortunately the ending seemed a bit contrived and the non-New York characters were poorly developed.  I didn't notice so much with the characters from the medical examiner's office in New York because most of them have been in other Cook novels I've read. Still and all the premise of the book was enough to keep me reading.  I was not totally comfortable with transgenic technology before I read the book, now I'm even less comfortable."

0,"Having read and enjoyed Jonathan Moellers The Frostborn series, I was eager to dive into his latest release, Hyperspace Demons.  That eagerness was rewarded by a thoroughly enjoyable, action packed story.  As a novella, the story ramps up to speed quickly.  Moeller does a very good job introducing new elements, like hyperspace and its risks, plus the equipment aboard the spaceship, all in the middle of a steady stream of exploits and conflicts the characters must deal with.  Everything comes together in a nice package.  The action is well done and kept me furiously turning pages.  But wait, theres more.  Mixed in with hyperspace and spaceships is the interesting concept of hyperspace microbes that can possess a human mind, driving the person insane.  These microbes are kept out of the spaceship by a special shield, so there shouldnt be any problems, right?  Thats where the plot pulls off some unexpected twists and turns, making for a fun read.  Moeller keeps up the pace all the way to the end.  Amazingly, for a novella there is much more that could be said, but I fear explaining anymore will reveal too much.  Too often, shorter stories leave me feeling unsatisfied.  But not Hyperspace Demons.  Interesting story.  Well told with plenty of action and a surprise or two thrown in.  Good job Jonathan Moeller."

0,"A wierd story with two completely independent plot lines that are only related because the protagonists know each other. Don't look for it to come together, or for either plot to come to much resolution. They both just kind of peter out.

1,I believe my cats like this food and the taste is good.  My only complaint is the ingredients.
0,This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.  These last so much longer than any other ball I have bought for my rough player.

1,"If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile, the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option. First of all, the 'central' location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier (which this hotel claims to be the 'official' hotel of) and to the shops on the Mile. Secondly, the hotel is small - only 215 rooms, most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. Thirdly, they have one restaurant and one lounge, both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia!"

But I stumbled across on at Costco at a great price so I picked it up for my 9 year-old daughter for Christmas. We have had a lot of fun with it even though it can get pretty obnoxious at times! It is funny how it progresses and it can change personality. But if you are aware of that feature, it makes it okay, especially if you know how to control the personalities.  This one is a nice set of blues and the amount of animation and movement is impressive for robotic toy in the price range that I paid ($30). So we will have fun with it and since it 'evolves' it will hopefully last longer than some other toys that disappear in a week.  As an adult, I'm fascinated to wake it up at times and see what it says. As long as I know how to turn it off when I'm tired of hearing the barrage of speech... then we are all good. My daughter has had fun as well."

I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.

He likes it, and so does my son.  He is now learning about the alphabet, letters, and numbers, and is enjoying playing with it.  It is easy enough for him to grasp and put together, but hard for him to put down and take it out of the box.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the show.

1,"We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! Fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. Once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. Needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again, let alone any other Hilton around. Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago!"

0,"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.  If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.  If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating."

I will probably just buy a new one, as it is cheaper, but it will be great for my dog. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog who is about 6 months old. She loved it and we adopted her. It fits perfectly in her crate and she is comfortable in it."

It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.  I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.  One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.  I've only come across the Royal Robbins brand recently and I think the quality and style of their lines are excellent.  Recommended."

With the deal the Ritz Carlton is putting on right now, stay two nights...get one free, choose the nicer option! Pros: Room Service: Quick! 15 minutes tops. Bathroom: Large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. Lobby: Very impressive, and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you. Location: Close to the train station and MI Ave. Cons: NO TOP SHEET! We asked the others at the conference, they confirmed...there is no top sheet. You just sleep with the duvet cover over you. Room: -Small, and not a fan of the modern decor. -Broken closet door, the bottom track was bent. By the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so I could get to my things. -Barely any storage: closet was teeny tiny anyways, almost no bigger than a tall locker, only the top drawers of the nightstands open. -Shower: Horrible water pressure. -The cleaning staff did not replace shampoo, soap, etc. Had to call the front desk, and they delivered within 10 mins. -The cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there, realized this as I still noticed a stain we made the first night. I made sure not to leave the 'save the water' card out. They changed our towels, but not the bedding??? -Our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter, and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day. -They charge for Wi-Fi! -You can change the settings on the tv...brightness, etc."

This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."
1,"Since there are not very many containers, the only thing I will say is that the handle has to be removed. The plastic part is also very light and not sturdy.

I use this to make homemade coffee and it is great!  It's easy to clean and easy to clean!  I would highly recommend it!I bought these for my daughter to use for her baked goods and she loves them!  She said they look great in the dishwasher and she is excited about them!I have been using this to keep my clothes dry for a long time and I like it.

0,"Above in the ""product discription""(Editorial Reviews) they have (on their long review) ""The Heart is the Lonely Hunter"" where is that in this box set. They also forget the discription for ""Brother Orchid"". ??  It is between ""Lady Killer"" and ""Smart Money""  as follows. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter stars Alan Arkin as John Singer, who is deaf. Singer moves from a small town in order to be close to his institutionalized deaf and mentally impaired friend Antonapoulos (Chuck McCann). Singer rents a room with a family whose father, Mr. Kelly (Biff McGuire), is unable to earn a living due to a serious injury. His teen-aged daughter Mick (Sondra Locke, in her film debut) is at first resentful of Singer's presence, but he ingratiates himself by introducing her to classical music (which he can ""feel,"" if not hear). Singer likewise tries to brighten the lives of such unfortunates as alcoholic Blount (Stacy Keach Jr. , also making his first film appearance), dying black doctor Copeland (Percy Rodriguez), and Copeland's poverty-stricken daughter (Cicely Tyson). ??????????

I've replaced many hundreds of drives in my career so I don't particularly get upset about the occasional failure and wouldn't characterize the product by a single experience.  Obviously in the case of the Seagate I haven't owned it long enough to know whether it will last longer or not.  It's worked for almost a month now and seems similar in performance which is quite high for a laptop drive.  I also have a SanDisk SSD which I am a little disappointed in simply because for practical purposes there is no performance advantage compared to these much less expensive and much higher capacity hard drives.  For a tablet or ultrabook I would go SSD, but for a mostly desk-bound laptop, these 750GB drives seem to work great."

The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son, and the doorman watched on doing nothing. Me and my girlfriend are young, look young in how we dress, but in all honesty make more money than most...and we were treated like cheap poor kids. I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up, the concierge exclaimed that, 'You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr. Blank?'

I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}  This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car."

Winters has done an amazing job in writing this series so far.  The second book picks up exactly where the first leaves off Allison is going through a rough time now that she has lost her job and she believes that Cooper was behind it all along. This book you will really find that you will have a love hate relationship with Cooper while he is absolutely charming and sweeps Allison off of her feet at times he also acts like a complete and total jerk during others, so in other words a complete and total alpha male (sinfully delicious yes please!). This book leaves you will a lot of questions at the end like whether or not this is going to work out for Allison and Cooper. Will he be able to change his ways? Will Allison finally be able to catch a break?  K.B. Winters did such a fantastic job writing this book it was full of drama, suspense, action and some hot and steamy sex scenes the chemistry between Allison and Cooper in this book is so great it just grabs you and makes you feel like you are right there along for the ride with them.

It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was worth it.I bought this as a gift for my grandson.  He loved it.  He has already been playing with it a lot and it seems like he will get some use out of it.  The pieces are very sturdy and easy to assemble.  I would definitely recommend it.  I would buy this again.  It is definitely worth the money.My son loves this car!  It is very well made and looks great on the wall.  It is easy to put together and it is a great starter car!  It is very sturdy and sturdy for our little guy.My granddaughter loved this doll. She was not into the dolls in general. She was just a little scared of the kids and didn't really like the idea of her dolls being made of wood. The dolls are fun to play with and are easy to put together. I would recommend this doll for any child who loves dolls.This is a great toy! My son loves it, he also loves the colors and the beads. It is really cute. The pictures are a little blurry"
0,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.  However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."
0,"Cute idea and set up but the manufacturers packaging really stinks which just ruined it for me! Drum sticks and stand were tossed in loose around the actual drums that were wedged into cheap, flimsy plastic packaging. Drum sticks arrived extremely bent, to the point where it's awkward to actually hit them on the drums, which is a bummer because we bought this as a cheap starter set for our daughters birthday and now we have to hunt for new sticks so she can even play it before we can give it to her."

0,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.  Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.  A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes. Snow Pup is the kind of story that will put the reader in the mood for the holiday season."

1,"Reviewed by Robin Book provided by the author  Rating: 4  Reviewed by Robin  Rating: 4. 5 stars  What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak. The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love. I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book. I loved the ending, but I wish there was more. I don't know if I will read the next book in the series, but I will definitely be reading more of this author's work. I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. I am voluntarily leaving a review on my blog. This is a cute story about a young man and a dog named Paul. It's a great story with good characters. The story is pretty cute, but not the perfect story for a younger adult. There are some things that I would like to see in this story. For example, if you are looking for a cute story with a good story line, this is a good one. Also, if you are looking for a story that isn't filled with a lot of angst, this is a good story. I will definitely be reading more of this author's works. This book is a sweet sweet romance. It is written well. The characters are well developed and the story is well written. There is a lot of sex and love in this book. I would recommend it."

0,"Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.  If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully."

But one thing for sure Darwinist get mad at any one who has evidence against evolution and in favor of a counter theory. Ben could done better. He could interview Dr Sanford. He is geneticist and could provide much needed TESTABLE evidence to the movie. I high encourage you to read genetic entropy & mystery of the genome. The problem Ben stein did not know of Dr Sanford work. Most people don't. It way most scientist think Neo Darwinian evolution is even possible.

The negligence Naomi and her brother Owen experience can make it helpful for children or people who are/have been in similar situations connect.  Naomi lives a simple life with her great grandmother and younger brother. Suddenly her mother comes back in the picture. It seems she is there to actually reunite with her children after seven long years however her reasons for being there are malicious. Naomi goes through heartache after her mother comes back into her life. At first everything seems like things are falling into place with the return of her mother but then the longer her mother is around she doesn't feel the love and comfort one would expect from a mother. Skyla, Naomi's mother is an alcoholic and only interested in taking Naomi with her, leaving her brother Owen behind.  Just when Naomi feels sad and unwanted she learns her father actually wanted her and her brother when they were young before Skyla abandoned them.  After Skyla threatens to take Naomi by force with her, in desperation her great grandmother takes her great grandchildren to Mexcio in hopes to find Santiago, Naomi's father and get a letter granting his permission for them to stay with her. In Mexico Naomi is able to connect to a side of her heritage she was unfamiliar with yet always connected to by her carvings. Overall it is a great story and readers will get tear-eyed as they go through this self discovery with Naomi."

0,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.  After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.  Simple Maintenance is key:  If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it. If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)  My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.  It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.  Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars."

The straps are very comfortable and the bottle is very easy to hold.  The bottle is very easy to put on and take off.

0,"It's difficult to open and close the side bags.  It really requires two hands, and when in saddle, that's annoying.  Hopefully we all have horses good enough that you CAN take your hands away from your reins, twist in your saddle, and fiddle with the zipper.  I do, but it's still annoying.  The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.  It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle. Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.  I can't quite give it 5 because I can't attest to whether or not the cantle bag is any good."

1,"I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online. However, my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations. When I arrived, well over an hour of check in time, I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in. The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs, and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd, there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down (after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue). As I am a fairly light sleeper, I woke up several times throughout the night. I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep. Overall the hotel looked very nice, but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room."

0,"As a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East, I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit. Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel, there was no in-room directory, the carpet was torn and stained, no phone book, the refigerator and honor bar had been removed, and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire. I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms, and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is untrue, as there are several larger room types. He didn't even offer to check availablity of other rooms! In talking with the consierge, she blamed everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been promising for more than two years. All in all, a very disappointing, and expensive, experience."

Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space, great jazz CD's in the room, wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The staff was very helpful with every request. The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's, fruit's and jucie's. We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests. Would highly recommend this hotel."
0,"Debating returning this dress. I sized one size UP to size small. I normally wear a size 0 or extra small in Ann Taylor or Bebe.  The size small is just absolutely perfect. The dress is extremely gorgeous.  I'm 5 foot two and the height of it is just in the middle of my knee. So it really has it vintage look to it. So with all that said, what's my beef with it?  Well I purchased a burgundy which appears to be a beautiful raspberry on both my iPhone and iPad. And it actually truly is a very doll burgundy. Secondly I had expected a knit fabric and this is a broadcloth  type fabric, you know the type of men shirts are made out of but with lots of stretch to it. And I'm worried that the dye looks rather cheap, that it might wash out and look very very faded after only two or three washes. Debating....$20 is a lot of money to spend on a dress with this excellent cut but it is a lot of money for a dress that doesn't get worn because it looks like a tired old rag."

0,"We arrived at the Omni on 2nd September for a 6 day stay. I took ill when I left the plane after travelling from Manchester so I saw more of the room than I anticipated. I couldn't go out for 4 days. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and very clean. What more could you ask. We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. A few sunbeds on a concrete floor. There was also noise from an air conditioning unit. It could do with a bit of cheering up. What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing, it has something for everyone. Would I go back to the Omni? yes I would."

0,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."

0,"Things that are terrifying or filled with sadness are not necessarily without beauty. The Book Thief is a story that exemplifies that principle. The characters are real and complex and the plot is captivating. But more than that, it's a book that shows the humanity of different individuals, while not shying away from the brutality of others. Using Death as the narrator adds another dimension to the novel. Nothing is new to Death, and yet he is moved and intrigued by this story and shares it with us, showing us the complexity of humanity. The Book Thief is the best contemporary young adult book I've read. I know some people feel it was wrongly marketed that way, but I think it fits the audience well, while not writing down to them. The voice and style are distinct enough to make it feel special, while the subject matter and characters are real enough to tell a great deal of truth about the human condition. It will be interesting to watch and see if it finds a place in school literature curricula. (9."

1,"I decided this summer that I wanted something with a more substantial design. This is the perfect one.  I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.  I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it has a very smooth surface, and it holds very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.

A stand alone radio that I have been using has much poorer reception than this unit.

I was looking for a ""go light"" quality built camera with lot of features and adjustments.  It came down to the Panasonic Lumix G-3 or Olympus Pen.  The Panasonic won the contest because it has both and high quality LCD screen AND a high quality viewfinder (although it is electronic not optical.)  In addition the LCD screen folder out and rotates270 degrees which is a very handy feature.  If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.  The only serious limitation is with the available reasonably priced lenses, the are relatively slow compared to more expensive 35mm camera lenses.  This is the reason for the 20mm lens, at F1.7 it is better for lowlight indoor or outdoor shooting."

The mids are somewhat there and the highs are almost no where to be found.

All in all, if all you need is bass consider these, if not just look elsewhere.  Oh yeah, I have a newer ipod, so sound coming from it is bound to be good. So there should be no problems coming from the music side."

1,"The heart rate function works fine. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.  I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work better.  The only problem is that it requires a little tightening.  The crank should also be a bit smaller than I wanted it to be.  I would recommend this if you are looking for a cheap replacement for a crank that is on a different brand.  I will update if I find another one.  Update: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review and unbiased review.I used this for a couple of months and it did the trick.

0,"I'm not a big DC comics fan, I find many of their heroes and villains to be rather unimaginative, there are simply better choice out there. My son in law really wanted to see this, so I rented it, and was pleasantly surprised. There were a few hokey bits (Batman doesn't kill Superman because their mothers had the same name?) but overall it was enjoyable, had a decent plot, and good action scenes. This is high praise from one who couldn't watch all of the last Superman movie. DC may do better in their ensemble pieces, like Suicide Squad or the Justice League. The teasers for the JLA looked pretty good, and Gal Gadot made a kick ass Wonder Woman, who enjoyed the fight.  So make up your own mind, that's what makes America great....."

I've been using this lens for about a year and it's still working great.  I have a Nikon D5100 and I've had it for about a month now and I'm still shooting pretty good.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit of a pain to mount.  I'm very careful about mounting the lens in a flat spot, but it's definitely not a problem.  I can mount it to a wall, ceiling, ceiling, and ceiling, but I don't want to mount it to a wall or ceiling.  I wish the mount had a hole for the metal screws to hold the lens down.  If you have a screw that's screwed into the wall or ceiling, then you can just mount the lens on the wall and"

This hotel is definitely the place that I want to come back to. By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare. One of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window. The feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind."

The story is told from the perspective of a woman in the early 20th century, and the characters are well developed.

After a little work, I was able to install Ubuntu on this drive and dual-boot between Linux and Windows 8.1.  Booting into Linux is super fast, even compared to regular Linux boot times.  For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down."

Hunter has never been in a relationship always choosing escorts to keep him company. He is part owner of a Brothel/Escort service.

Just one problem Elizabeth can't afford the medical expenses.  This is were Elizabeth forms a plan to sell her virginity to the highest bidder. This is also were the excitement begins. There are so many levels to this book. It is part romance, erotica, mystery, and suspense.  This was a well written book with a great story line. I loved that it ended and it wasn't a cliffhanger. I do wish that there were more parts with Hunter and Elizabeth together and a little less of the Priscilla parts."

0,"Mr. Carroll has written an interesting book.  I read this book in a matter of days, a sure sign it never got boring. I disagreed with Mr. Carroll constantly, but still give the book a  high rating.  I came away from the book finding Mr. Carroll to be phony. A man rebelling against an overbearing father by entering the Priesthood, a vocation he was completely unfit for. He showed no respect for his vocation at the seminary where he and his fellow seminarians cursed their directors and teachers. He was ordained and became a professional protester, I don't recall him performing many priestly duties, but he sure did a lot of protesting against the Vietnam War. He did seem to realize he wasn't Priestly material soon after the war ended. I find it amazing how many seminarians and young Priests seemed to lose their Priestly vocation after the war ended and they were in no danger of being drafted.  I did find his father to be overbearing and abrasive at times, but it always seemed that his father was the one reaching out to reconcile with his son. Mr. Carroll is always right and dear ole dad is always wrong, I think he should have evaluated himself and looked more closely at his father's points of view before writing this book. It must feel good knowing you have never been wrong."

I gave one to my son and immediately he asked us for more so I got him this 5 pack.  Be aware though that there is a version two of this bug which does a little more things.  These little robotic bugs run around like little bugs bumping into things and changing directions.  It seems irradic for the most part, but the packaging states that they do have basic sensors that allow it to react to its surrounding.  If you have a little boy or girl that likes lego, robots, and r/c stuff I am sure they will like these little guys."

0,"I love this story. All the characters and the experiences really hit me. My heart hurt when the characters were in pain and I was so happy when they were experiencing joy. I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.  I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.  I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.  I fell completely in love with the concept of snow globe moments. It reminds you to always be present in the experiences while you're in them and to always look for adventure and joy."

They fit exactly the way they are intended. They fit as though your foot is poured into a boot mold. haha. Of course, if they fit correctly, they should be a bit tight the first few times, they weather slowly, and fit your foot, well, like a glove. These were exactly what we had hoped, and Vid was extremely grateful, smiled all day. We are pleased that our staff member finally knows what a quality boot should be, and we're confident he's as comfortable as he can be while he works. That makes everyone happy. Even the horses.

Instead of a movie saying, ""here is a package that ties with a silk ribbon on top"" it instead says ""walk along with me, I am hurting too, and I am willing to respond in an inclusive manner rather than hardening in my isolation and spitting my hatred all over anyone that comes close""...It is this message that I found refreshing, and maybe even a little inspiring.

0,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.  The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.  I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.  The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!  I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."

0,"I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.  UPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.  Take the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now."

The pieces in the ""dog"" ones are bigger & sometimes harder than the ones for cats. I do  have to break up the big pieces and eliminate the really hard ones, but it is such a good value that it seems worth the extra work.  edit 4/8/16- when I got towards the bottom of the bag some of the pieces were VERY hard and not usable for cats.

The build quality is good, but it is made entirely of lightweight plastic.  It is mostly correct, except the poseable arms are a little off. They do not retract inside the robot and instead stick out. It's not a big deal. The robot is about 10"" tall, but you can raise the head to make it about 11"".  The robot includes 3 cheap AAA trial batteries. I immediately replaced them with Alkalines. They are accessed from the bottom of the robot, and a screwdriver is required.  The power switch is also on the bottom. Options are: Off, Play, and Trial. Dialogue is triggered by pushing the robot's power pack on the side. Push it once, and it says one the robot's popular phrases. Hold the button for a few seconds, and it will go thru all the robot's dialogue. If I counted correctly, there are 15 phrases.  The LED lights look very cool.  All around, I like this little robot.

0,"This book was like a breath of fresh air after decades of being immersed in the increasingly bizarre Niagara of conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination.  Posner did what no one thought possible, he drained a swamp.  Sticking to meticulous verifiable fact and going back to first sources Posner asserts that the truth was there all along.  His reading style is easy, moving along and building up the facts bit by bit.  What Posner shows is that these theories often collapse under the weight of their own Byzantine thinking.  I still reread it occasionally just to enjoy a careful mind making a logical case out of a morass of nonsense."
0,"Mary Shelley, who, in my assumption, was truly a fascinating author. She weaved together a very fast moving extraordinary saga, THE LAST MAN that kept me enthralled. Lionels life began on a cheerful note, but then tragedy struck. As I watched Lionels emotions go from sorrow, to bliss, back to sorrow, then grief in one brief moment took him by the throat and would not let go until his heart was broken. As deep depression set in he felt pure torment and could do nothing but try to comfort those around him as his dear friends, neighbors, and family departed, one by one, from what seemed to be a never-ending epidemic that swept through each countryside. This skillfully written masterpiece of a seriously tragic and also an intensely passionate story regarding love found, then lost through devastation, which led to unspeakable sorrow and loneliness, held me as I read line after line, and page after page, savoring every word. As I followed Lionel through his existence, in each chapter he must take action against this foe that always seemed to have the upper hand in everything, and yet, each time, he knew he must move on because of the need to find others. Will he have to live in constant silence, or will there be someone out there waiting to be heard? From the Sibyls Cave, where it all seemed to initiate, all the way through to the end, or the start of a new beginning, this fascinating tale of intrigue led me down some desolate paths, and through some unforgettable and very picturesque forlorn valleys."

0,"I purchase this book to flesh out data regarding life in post war Europe.  Having interviewed survivors of the conflict in both eastern and western Europe I was disappointed at the lack of substance and the lack of clarity of the author.  It started with the author's allegation that there is a vast amount of information about Eastern Europe and his intention to portray a balanced look at Europe as a whole.  Surprisingly, the focus continued to be Western Europe with some information regarding Eastern Europe.  For, example is that a crucial piece of data omitted as to the penalty for harboring a Jew in occupied Europe:  Specifically, that only in Poland was a death penalty imposed.  Then, the misrepresentation of facts and eyewitness accounts to fit the author's notions.  For example, Lowe reported soviet atrocities seemingly as portrayed by Nazi propaganda (""...according to the German Captain..."") whilst minimizing Soviet eyewitnesses German atrocities (""...claimed a Read Army soldier..."").  I can go on ad infinitum but will relay an omission of fact.  Upon annexing western Poland into the Reich, the Germans proceeded to deport Polish inhabitants to the General Government area with the vacant house occupied by colonizers.  What could have been an excellent book on the subject of post war struggles to survive turned out to be a book with slanted conclusions as well as selective presentation of facts.  One thing that the author did capture correctly albeit again slanted was the actions of the western soldiers.  We hear of the raping of French colonial troops.  We hear how the Americans paid desperate women for sex (which is a form of rape).  However, we hear that the British soldier were disgusted.  Can it be that Lowe is a British author?  A vast majority of soldiers behave badly in war.  The rarity is the noble soldier who does nothing bad or evil."
0,"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc. As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks. As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.  I love that I can tuck my pants in or wear them over.  I've pretty much worn them every day for the last couple of weeks.  I'm already looking at getting a suede pair. Buy these boots.  They're everything."

When a teacher starts talking about Evolution, Mina gets a chance to fight back.  I think most teenagers are fighting battles of one sort or another, so it's great to read about someone else who's fighting.

0,"Prior to buying these rings I was working out on a bar, and find the rings to be much more versatile and potent.  They are easy to adjust for height (pullups to dips, for example), and setup was a snap - I have them hanging from an open joist in the garage.  After a few weeks on these, my physique has popped, and strength is increased, I believe it's because I'm using more stabilizing muscles to perform a given exercise.  There are many exercises that can be performed on the rings, even front and reverse flys, which are excruciating and maybe a bit much for me right now, but I never got this level of intensity from bar work.  I also love that they rotate and follow my body's natural form, so there is much less stress on the joints and connective tissue, and I can feel the difference in my elbows, wrists, and shoulders.

0,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:  1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents. 2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend. 3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container. 4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking. 5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor. 6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems. 7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes. 8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.  I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons; 1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into. 2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms. 3. Again I had realistic expectation. 4. I'm into fun stuff 5. I'm sentimental for the old days. look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have. Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious. In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun. But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am."

0,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".  Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.  Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.  In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).  Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.  You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!"

0,"This is the first Sharon Shinn book I've ever read, but I've heard good things about her other books (Archangel, Jovah's Angel) so I decided to give it a try. I liked the setting, but I do wish some things had been explained in a bit more detail, like the Moonchildren.  I especially liked the use of words from ""our"" languages, altered to reflect the passage of time.  It's a detail many ""colony of earth"" sci-fi writers ignore or bungle. I can't say the mystery enthralled me, I figured the second biggest mystery about half-way through the book.  The ""whodunnit"" part was weak, but this book is worth reading purely for the philosophy of the Triumphantes. It's a believable world, and the characters are well-drawn.  I don't regret buying it."

0,"Quality and quite nonstick  I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.  Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever. My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them. My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.  So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc. Enter the CSX series.  I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.  It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze. I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.  It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).  I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

0,"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.  The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.  The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.  The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store.

0,"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...  In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!  They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.  I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.  So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good."

These are the milestones of achievement marking the road to the extreme points on our earth, which have always inspired the sons of others nations.

The restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay. The hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping / restaurants and sights! Rooms were lovely, althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side.

0,"""The Other Guys"" is a fun movie. It is a great comedy which also manages to not insult the viewer's intelligence. Rather than having typical comedy cops following a ""by-the-numbers"" case, the case they follow actually has complexities and requires the viewer to pay attention. At the same time, it keeps the viewer laughing with funny jokes, quirky characters and funny situations."

This short story is the story of their marriage from the point of view not handled in the original telling. Look at Laurie King's other writing as well.

0,This product is all plastic with a fake leather like material pretty much glued on to the casing. My wife's ipad mini 2 retina would not fit this case. One side corner would snap in and the other wouldn't even push in. Past reviews say they fixed issues with the hinge. I do not agree. This product wasn't even worth the $30 I spent including shipping and the overall price is $99... It's plastic. Cheap plastic. Only reason I give a 3 star rating is because the seller responded quickly and because their shipping was so quick. My seller review would be considered a 5 star.

0,"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""  The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.  However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."
0,"I have two cats - one who was OBSESSED with these treats and another who turned his nose up at these.  My cat who ate these was a consistent vomiter, and I always assumed it was hairball related.  However,  I started to notice that after she ate these treats, she seemed to throw up more.... I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!  After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.  If you must give these to your cat, please proceed with caution and keep an eye on their health."
0,"I acknowledge, that I ordered these boots and others very quickly, as I got a great promotional price.  However, I did not realize that everything but the shoe part itself is quilted cloth! I honestly cannot believe it. However, it does say this in the written description. Also, the buckle is barely noticeable and it does not stand out at all. I had just ordered a Ralph-13 in pewter, and these are very different.  They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.  Honestly, these remind me of snow boots I may have worn as a kid. I definitely do not feel they are worth the money that is shown. I will keep them only because I got such fantastic deals on a number of boots."

It came be a bit frustrating because they want to play with their cars at the same time but at 9 and 11 years old, they overcome the issue be just staying apart enough distance so it isn't a problem.  The Mustang is super cool and the kids (and Dad) thought this one was the coolest.

0,"While overall a decent property, the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights, checking out on Monday, March 19th. Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. The garage manager, Mike Yunan, didn't call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, Marco Scherer. When he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an 'incident report' and claim with his insurance company, Travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. In the end, this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. In the end, do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible."

It is very comfortable for both dogs. I bought this for my dog who is a chewer. He will go to the vet and the vet will say that if he chews on something, he will get a vet check. I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his first time using this. He has been on it for about a month now and has started to get better. He is a very picky eater and his food is less full of junk and he does not like to eat anything else. It is not for a chewer. It is for the dog that is not a chewer. I give this to him only once a week and he eats it in about a month. He has not gotten sick of it and is very happy."

Installation was easy and the drive is recognized without issue. I played Super on BD with no skips or issues whatsoever. A great value and a wonderful way to keep my slim drive out of the junk drawer.
0,"I made reservations with the Chicago Fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in June. I received no written confirmation with cancelation policy, etc. However, when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night's reservation, I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay. They have a '3pm THE DAY BEFORE your first nights stay' policy. Even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy. This is not a common policy on Michigan Ave. I'd advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy. It was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel!"

This is exciting and relatable for woman who are in their forties or have dated younger men. I love Alessandres intelligence and confidence. He works Pearl from the moment they meet in that coffee shop! Real men need to be this way, to actually know what they want in a woman and not confuse lust with love and affection. To have the courage to pursue passion! The author created a great plot that never lacked for twists and turns. I love a smart, well dressed, sexually confident man, nothing compares with the Alpha male created in this book."

0,"I highly recommend this case. Especially if you use your phone for things like watching video, reading documents and such. The case is very protective at the corners which is where a phone gets most damage. The two features i love are the standing slot and the auto on. Whenever you open the case the screen automatically turns on. This feature doesnt waste any battery and it saves you if your power button is losing. you don't even have to latch it everytime, I only latch it when i put it in my pocket. Normally i just let the cover down until the latch is resting on the edge and it shuts the screen off. The inside is very soft and won't scratch the screen and the outside feels great. Nothing i can find wrong with it except i wish it covered the edges of the phone more like it does the corners."
0,"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading."

I have to say that the one thing I miss most about the 80 is definitely Fannypack's. That said, it is hard to find one that is useful and stylish. I got this in the orange color and love it. It has a lightweight nylon like fabric and looks great and very durable. I don't care what anyone says  the convenience of a  Fannypack far outweighs the fashion benefits of even my most user-friendly  and functional purse! The Zippers are heavy duty and nothing about it feels cheap so I expect to be using this for a long time  as it has a great high-quality feel to it. I received this at a discount so that I can try it out and offer her my honest and unbiased opinion and review."

(The Sears batteries were no longer capable of retaining a charge long enough to be useful.)  The BDCCS20B circular saw is a new addition to the 20V Max family.  It serves me well for trimming shelves and various projects around the house.  And unlike the old circular saw, I don't have to stop every half hour to replace the battery pack. My new 20V Max tool set also includes the recip saw (also reviewed) and the edger/trimmer.  I will continue to rely on Black & Decker for more 20V Max tools!"

The actors are all very good.  I am very happy with this purchase.This movie was okay. It was good for the heart and for the family. It was also good for the kids. I think I would have given it 5 stars if I had not watched it.I really enjoyed this movie. It was good, and the ending was a little disappointing. I just wish they had made more episodes.I didn't see it on TV when I was a kid, but I found it to be a fun, scary and suspenseful movie.  It's a family film, and if you're a fan of the genre, you will love it.  A really fun movie that shows just how well the British accent can be accentuated.  It's a very fun movie to watch, and a little too long, but it's worth the time.  I recommend it to anyone who's looking for something that's not too scary and suspenseful.I liked this movie because I thought it was so funny, but it was a little too"

It truly is amazing what you can do with your mind and you can tip the balance of any situation just with a thought. I feel like now I am more focused, conscious about my surroundings and kind of like more in control of my life. Really good book and worth the read for sure!"
1,"So, think you'd like to know more about the movie? I did. The movie has a lot of heart-warming moments, but also some serious violence, so it's not that it's a little depressing. I think it's because I don't know how to put it all together. I did, however, learn a lot from the book. I just didn't get it. I really didn't like the ending, so I don't know how to describe it. I liked the ending, but I didn't like the story. I thought the ending was okay, but it wasn't that good. I think it's because the movie was so predictable. There was a lot of promise and a lot of action, and the ending was really predictable. I didn't like the ending. I didn't like the ending."

It works perfectly for both uses, and neither of them has lost and strength or spring in the months that I've been using them.

Amber once again gives us a heartwarming HEA ending! Thank you for another truly delightful and enjoyable read Ms."
0,They allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water. We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party. When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. When we called back nothing was done about it. My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. THEN we get up the next morning at 7:30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. They did not resolve this issue. They just keep passing my complaint to 'managers' supposedly. It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it

I'm so tired of being, personal opinion here, ripped off by authors who have a greater opinion of their ability than may be justified. I believe in paying for the author's legitimate intellectual property. However, looking at prices some of the greater authors, ( Niven, McCafrey, etc), some are having delusions of grandeur. This was a very good story and suspense was palpable. If you liked Anneka, Honor, you'll like this. Not so out there as Nova.

0,"I bought this to replace a smaller pack. It's worked out well for me. I have carried upwards of 80+ lbs. with no problems several miles. Not quite sure about the two loops on the lower back area. Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. ) Anyhow the backpack stood up to the 10 day trip and it's ready now for an other trip that I'm planning. I am considering buying the Ospray 105 only because I'm a big guy and it would fit me better."
0,"Three nights there on business. Hadn't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement, very bleak. Told the front desk that I hadn't realized about the construction, so I'd have to switch hotels, they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights. So I stayed. TV didn't work. Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me...eventually after I called again, a few hours later, a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it. Long and complicated experience at the business center (which doesn't open until 9am, BTW), where I ended up paying $45 to print 55 pages. Had to buy these cards, and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway, (and charging me for them). I was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago, 2000 miles from where I live. I asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that. Nice room, nice view, but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad. Worst experience I've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business."

0,"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.  This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.  I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.  I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."

0,"This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. However, when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. Wireless internet is available, but that's an additional fee. Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free! Also, the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. Wow, I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. When I used the coffee supplies in the room, they were not replenished. I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. No kidding, nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar! Glad I wasn't in a big hurry. I'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I'm in Chicago!"

0,This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.

0,"Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago. We decided to stay at the Talbott, and we reserved a room there over a month ago. I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful, but the accommodations to be quite disappointing. We were given room #1605. Avoid this room at all costs! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night (and then awaken you at 6 AM). In addition, we had requested a king bed, and #1605 has two doubles. We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room. Despite the very friendly staff and its super location, the Talbott was less than what we expected, and we would probably not stay there again."

0,"Its always been a struggle for me to find clothes that fits perfectly on me. One that I don't have to do something and alter it or cut the legs to be the exact length for my legs. I am size one and the waist and hips of size one usually fits on me aside from the legs part. They usually are longer and even though I got a size one of thissuper comfy stretch denim five pocket jeans it is still a little big on me especially on the hip and back side maybe because I am not that gifted on that part. The hip is also a bit higher than my usual preference but that is fine since I don't tuck my shirts. I wish that the front pockets are a little deeper. These are the down sides when purchasing clothes online. Even if you got your size there is no guarantee that it fits exactly the same. Others are cut differently and sometimes smaller or bigger on you. I will just have to remedy it since thats what I normally do. Despite that the jeans was well made and the stitches are sturdy. The fabric stretches just like they said it is which is a good thing since for me, stretchable jeans are more comfortable to wear and easier to take off than the denims. This comes in six different colors. I got the black coz back when I got it, other colors doesnt have my size. Thankfully, I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and fair review."

0,"The real secret to good wallpaper removal with DIF is to also buy the Zinsser Scoring tool and the ""2986 PaperScraper Wallpaper Remover and Wall Scraper Tool"" and use all of them with patience!

The suction is so great, it's impossible to get it to be fixed without a vacuum. If I had to replace it, I would have given it 4 stars instead of 5. I had to order a second one to replace the first one."

1,"Let's be a little more specific. The fact that these two men are also Christians doesn't mean they agree on every thing. I am not saying that the Bible isn't a very interesting book, but it is certainly not a very informative one. If you are looking for a good read, then this book is for you. I had to give it a pass because I didn't like any of the characters. I found it to be very predictable and a bit of a mess. I did find it interesting that the church has a theology of death and resurrection, but I didn't find it particularly interesting that they have a theology of a woman and not a theology of a man. I found it interesting that the church does not believe in a person who dies in a few days and has a resurrection. I found it interesting that the church does not believe in a man who dies and has a resurrection. I found it interesting that the church does not believe in a man who dies and has a resurrection. I am not saying that the church didn't have a theology of death and resurrection, but I am saying that it did have a theology of a man and a theology of a woman.

1,"My family and I were in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice, but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel. The hotel appeared very nice, and to have all the amenities: Room service, WiFi, clean rooms. Unfortunately, as it turned out, appearances can be deceiving. It begins at the desk, where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring. He said they didn't have any rooms available because we didn't make arrangements. It was getting late, and we had no place to go, there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. I asked if there was anything he could do, and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy. I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing, the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night. Apparently, our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard, because this room wasn't even clean and the wifi didn't work. We ordered room service, and it never came, even after several complaints. It doesn't end there either; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service. Overall, this was a very frustrating experience, and I wouldn't stay there again."

I have been using this toy for several years.  I will be buying another for the puppy soon.My dog is the most picky eater I have ever seen.  I give her a lot of treats and I give her a lot of treats because she loves to eat so much.  She is eating about 1/4 cup every day, which is about half the size of a regular food.  It is definitely a healthy food for her and she eats it without hesitation.  I am going to give this 5 stars because it is not too expensive.  I have had it for a while now and I have noticed that it has no additives in it.  She is not picky, so I don't think I will be eating this again.  I bought this because of the fact that the other dog food I have used for her has no additives.

0,"This dog bowl is super cute!  Very colorful, and l like the idea of the removable inner stainless steel bowl.  (Prevents allergies to plastic in pups).  The size is perfect for small dogs, it fits on my hand to give an idea of size. Cons:  I was not happy that the outer plastic bowl came scratched.  It wasn't packaged well and because it is an add-on item it probably was not handled gently. Other then the aesthetic flaw from handling, I really do like this bowl.  It does leave me with a feeling this product will not keep its cute looks over time though so I reduced the stars on rating, because of that reason."

0,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed. The plot really had a lot of potential, the story would have been better had it focused on the plot and kept the romance clean and simple. Less is usually more."

It's a great game and finally after months of me winning every game, my kids have all beaten me at least once (and I do not believe in throwing a game). The board is set up like a map of the United Sates and each person is giving routes that they have to complete. You get points for completing your route, or you lose those points if you don't get them. The concept is relatively easy, but it's a lot of fun! I only have one real issue with this game and that is that the cards used are small cards - not your standard playing card size. It's terribly annoying for shuffling, etc. I really wish they'd make them standard size instead."

0,"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:  1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason  2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainly to add minutes to the movie;  3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;  4) lots of bad acting;  5) awful music of any genre.  SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.  The identity of the speed demon is so hilarious, it defies belief."

0,"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.  As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.  The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.  The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.  Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.  I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion."

These two little old ladies stay in trouble with the sheriff, as they continue to run into murder after murder. They get into one scrape after another, but they solve the murder.  The one downside is that it needs better editing.  Use of I and me are incorrectly used often.

0,"My veterinarian recommended this product for my dog who has an intervertebral disc problem.  She does not have arthritis. My dog was also given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, rimadyl, for a month, and put on restricted walking. These are probably responsible for my dog getting better. I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit. So it is unlikely that my dog will benefit much from this particular product."

0,"I got this for my 5 year old son.  He loves it.  It's easy for him to use.  He can pretty independently use this.  What I have to help with is the loading of the paper and clean up.  For clean up, immediately after he's done playing with it, I run it under water.  When we ran out of paper, we just got some of the larger sized index cards and cut them to size.  Off the top of my head I can't remember if they're 5x5 or 4x4 squares.  Worked well.  We ran out of paint.  The bottles can be refilled.  To take the cap off, I unscrewed the cover but didn't remove it from the tip.  Then I tilted the cover to pull the tip off.  The tip came off and I am able to refill it with whatever paint I have."
0,"`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.  The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.  I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.  The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting."

I liked the color combination of this one along with the style.  Has the ability to make the instep area tighter or looser as necessary and the heel area is velcro and can be lengthened or shortened if need be.  The strap across the foot is also ajustable for making just the right fit.  I have a slight issue on the inside near the big toe area where my toe nail hits a seam but I'm hoping that additional wear will break them in. (and yes I have clipped my nails!)  Cute and comfy."

0,"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.  At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.  If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.  If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo."

0,"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.  Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon."

0,"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received. First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus. Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range. Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect. Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars."

Mental illness is a terrible and sad fact of life, and the ripple effects on the people around someone who suffers from a mental illness can be devastating in the extreme.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire."

0,"This is the final in the series of a long running and great TV show.  The eleventh and twelfth season episodes clearly lack the polish and good story lines of all the other episodes.  James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth seasons is sorely missed.  As good as the new characters are such as William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines.  It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord was not the easiest individual to work with.  His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth.  Without Danno and all the other wonderful personalities around him, he rather fades into background.  The very final episode has Lord as the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat.  The episode quite fell flat (pardon the poor rhyme).  Seasons 1 through ten are stellar."

I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.  I have used these pretty extensively and they look brand new.

1,"This is a big hit with my puppy.  She has a lot of hair and this one is a big hit.  I am using it for the first time in a long time.  She is still very much a puppy, but it's going to be a while before we see how it goes.  I did get a free item for review purposes and so far the dogs love it.  They are able to chew on it and it's a good toy for them.  They are also very happy with it.  I will definitely continue to buy it."
0,"This book is laugh out loud funny.  The simple drawings add wonderful,  ridiculous understanding of the events being described in Allie Brosh's unique voice.  One of the most poignant descriptions of what it is like for a brilliant mind to be haunted by depression.  She still manages to make the subject entertaining."
0,"Obsession by Jessica Hawkins Beau did not see the revenge coming but when it happened he was angry and wanted to find Lola.  He wanted to destroy her?  Lola played the final card which not only hurt Beau but herself as well.  While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending.. Hot Books & Sassy Girls Blog"
1,The story of how 300 years old people are reanimated after being exposed to the sun and the other elements.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is based on a novel by the late Robert Burns.  The film was filmed in the 1980s and is a 2 hour documentary on the history of the universe.  The DVD features interviews with the film making crew and the crew members.  The movie is a continuation of the original film by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is about the creation of the universe.  This is the first time I have seen this film.  It is definitely a must see for fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.This was a great movie and the acting was good. I loved it and the story was good

0,"While I love an action romance story like everyone else,what I can't get is when the editing is poor that it takes away from the story. This is such a good story with a whole lot of potential,but the need for better editing takes that away. This is sexy sensual romance between two very stubborn and strong willed people. The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe. I love the action between these two characters,I just wish for a tad bit more story and a little more from the supporting cast. The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings. This was a really good solid story,one you can not regret reading. I would love to see a revised version and it be released if possible and with a not so abrupt ending."

0,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.  The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.  Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!  Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review."

1,"Oh my goodness, this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago. It all went well enough checking in, but them went downhill. There was so much left to be desired. The biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet, I kid you not! I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it, I just don't know. But for the prices they charge, this type of thing is unacceptable. Most everything else about the actual room was as expected. The noise was a bit more than I'm used to though, but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us. So we asked to be moved to another room, they did get us in another room, but that took nearly 2 hours. The second room worked out well for us, but I won't be risking staying here again. Plus the pool was not available, I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website, I was looking forward to it for days. All in all, it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location, but they need to work on their customer service before I'll reconsider staying at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown."

0,"This is a book about a young man with a dark past and a young woman with a future on which she placed all of her faith. Lucas hadn't known Jacqueline, but he had watched her from a distance. Jacqueline didn't even know that Lucas truly existed until one night he saved her from a horrible incident. Now it seems as if she keeps running into him. Jacqueline can't get him out of her head. Lucas is the ""bad boy"" with the tattoos to go along with that stereotype. He is sexy in every way. He's good looking, has tattoos, is mysterious, and knows how to teach a girl how to defend herself. Jacqueline can't seem to keep herself away from the mystery of him. This book is full of angst and passion, and takes you through the journey of falling in love and lust.  I fell in love with this book! I enjoyed the mystery that surrounded Lucas and the love/lust that Lucas and Jacqueline shared. This was a book that was written to emulate real life, which was a nice break from all the fantasy I have been reading. I thought this book was going to just be a love/lust book with not much else going on, but there was an adventure presented by the incidents that happened as well as deception. I was entertained through the whole length. I found out that there will be a second book, Breakable, being released May 6, 2014. You better believe that I have already pre-ordered it! I rated this book 5/5 stars and highly recommend it."
1,"I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago. I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago's exciting night life. I found The Talbott Hotel's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for. The price sounded reasonable, so I booked a room. The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that Friday afternoon. After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. They blamed this on shortage of maids that day. They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. This disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again? Probably not."

1,"During my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago,Illinois, at one of their Deluxe suites. Unfortunately, and I think I speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. When one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. First of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. Second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. For people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. For these, as well as other similar reasons, I would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations."

1,"I bought this bag and it has been an awesome experience.  I also have a large one.  The extra pocket is nice, but it is a little tight.  I used this to hold my camera and in case I needed to use it as a backup to my camera.  It was a great bag, I did not want to be able to carry a camera with me.  I would recommend this bag to anyone who is considering purchasing this bag.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built.

I can't tell you how much I love the bag, but I do have to say that I have a hard time finding a bag that is actually ""stiff"" enough to be comfortable.

0,"The finale was decent- alot of zombies- and they finally got off the farm. If they spend next season only at the prison it will get drawn-out though. Outside of Rick, Daryl, and Andrea however the other characters are weak. It's not a good thing when you don't really care if most of the cast gets killed-off. Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here. Well, let's see what season 3 brings.

0,"I cut this device a lot a slack in terms of criticism because it was so inexpensive (under $40).  It works as described and, with a little tedious fine tuning, it delivers a pretty clear picture. But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception. When used with a Slingbox this camera makes a pretty neat nanny cam--the live feed can be viewed from any web browser or from a smart phone (e.g. iphone, blackberry) and can be recorded to PC if desired."

0,"Was there recently for one night for a conference. Tried to check-in at 5:30pm (the published check-in was 3pm), they said my room wasn't ready, where as others coming after me were assigned rooms. Was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready. I chilled there until 8pm, no call, so went out for dinner. Came back at 9:30pm and asked if my room was ready. The gal said of course yes and give me a key. When asked why no one called me, she just shrugged. No, my troubles did not end there. I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room. Came back to the lobby, then they apologized and gave me another room. I said I was not going to walk-in on somebody else again, so they sent someone with me to open the new room. For all my 'trouble' they reduced my bill by about 40%. It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru. Very bad experience."

The characters are different, and the plots are very interesting.  The movie is in English, which is one of the most important languages in the world. It is a great way to introduce yourself to the story, and it is a great way to get a sense of the characters and their motivations. The special effects are excellent, and the cinematography is superb.  The sound is excellent. I liked the song ""Yes, That's Me"" and the movie's theme.

0,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

0,"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).   Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?   Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).   One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports.

I highly recommend the whole series!  I really enjoyed Stella's character. She was very realistic, down to her insecurities. Because we all know sometimes we aren't as confident with our bodies as we would like to be. I loved how the two guys were each their own person. They had completely different personalities which lead to different working relationships and what people thought of them. I thought that was really unique because often it seems multiple characters will start to essentially merge into one.  The love aspect between Stella and the men in this book was a little hard to believe compared to some of the other books.

0,"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey. I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."

0,"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.  The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.  The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.  If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR."
0,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.  First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one: Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.  Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.  The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.  This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.  The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."
0,"As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro, I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left. She seems to have a cough today. In the room on my right, someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit. I hear the water running and the toilet flushing. I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs. Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms. I've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst. The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains, the curtains with a large brown stain (I don't want to guess what it is), paint peeling, rips in the wallpaper. The decor is a bit garish, with Pepto-Bismol covered walls, green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet. The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable, but I'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others' toilets flushing all night. The location is good for downtown theaters or business. Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly. Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I've enjoyed quite a bit. Unfortunately this is not one of them, and even more unfortunate for me: I'm stuck here for two more nights. I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip, comfortable and attractive. This is not."
0,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.  Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.  Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.  Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!  Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games."

Tavis, whom I admire, lets his guests speak what is in their hearts with little interruption yet through skillful guidance.  All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.

I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece. Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. The American Girl package was perfect for us. My 8 year old daughter was thrilled. They give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. Our room, 1334, was large and clean. It had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. The employees are all very friendly and helpful. We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there. We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast.

0,"ISBN 034536161X - Back to books related to WWII and religious artifacts. As a group, these books are interesting if only for the complete effect - from Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders to The DaVinci Code to Indiana Jones, the differences and similarities in the tales are fascinating. Indy begins the book by closing out his nearly lifelong chase after the Cross of Coronado. Ready for a return to the academic life, he returns late for the school year, only to find that his father is missing. Henry Jones has his own lifelong chase nearing an end - he appears to be within sight of the Grail Cup, and there are several groups of people who will do anything to beat him to it. Nazis, Henry's assistant Elsa, and a secret Brotherhood all have their eyes on the same prize, for their own reasons. Who will reach it first isn't nearly as important as who will be allowed to claim it. As adventure books on the subject go, The Last Crusade is an odd mix of lightheartedness and murder, which detracts from the excitement of the story in the book but played well in the movie. Overall, though, it's a nice adaptation of the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam."

0,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.  **UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**  This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.  Here are some professional reviews:  wccftech. com/review/sapphire-r9-fury-nitro-review/  pcworld. com/article/3037975/components-graphics/sapphire-nitro-r9-fury-graphics-card-review-fast-furious-and-ridiculously-quiet.html  kitguru. net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/sapphire-nitro-r9-fury-oc-4gb-review/  techpowerup. com/reviews/Sapphire/R9_Fury_Tri-X_OC/  hexus. net/tech/reviews/graphics/90086-sapphire-radeon-r9-fury-nitro/  hardwareasylum. com/reviews/video/sapphire_r9fury-nitro  eteknix. com/sapphire-nitro-oc-r9-fury-graphics-card-review/  **Remember to delete the space between the .com as Amazon does not allow direct links in reviews.  I hope this review helps - good luck!"

0,"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people."

1,"I really wish I could say that I liked this hotel, but the whole experience was just plain awful. My first warning sign should have been when I made my reservation. The person I spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. At first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel, and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel I was actually wanting, he booked me for the wrong dates. He read me the right dates, and it was only when I called back two days later to confirm that I found out he'd given me the wrong dates. Hilton did get it fixed, but I already had a bad feeling about my stay. Then came actually staying at the hotel. The people at the check-in desk were downright rude. Then there was the room. I was supposed to be in a non-smoking room, but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. The hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. However, I might as well have stayed in the first room. I was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. The sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. Yes, I was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. Since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. The walls were so paper thin, all I could hear all night was barking. When I complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick I shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. Yeah right. I was excited to use the pool, but just like my room, it hadn't been cleaned recently. Then, I tried the fitness center. Half the equipment was broken. I tried to cut my stay short, but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all. They even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness I had to deal with. I will never stay with Hilton again, and I will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was."

While in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor, a voice emanating from the phone, informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow. Anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom, wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door.Do not use the elevators and wait for further instructions.We nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone.We then decided to exit via the stairs, realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells, doors behind you were locked.We continued to travel downward, against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers.Obviously, we were rescued without any physical injuries; yet emotionally we were damaged.I now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less."

0,"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)  Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.  The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made."
0,"This the second part of the Hero trilogy and it's more suspenseful than the first. The sexual tension and frustration is still thick between Haze and  Leighton. The story is so well written that as the reader, you feel frustrated yourself. You want these two to just throw away the excuses and realize they are better together than they are apart. With how this one ended, I hope they do.  Frustrating but the tension and suspense makes it worth the read."

0,"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.  It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.  In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death."

The handle is nice and strong. It's easy to hold and carry. The leash is very flexible and easy to change. I've never had any issues with the dog pulling on it or it breaking.

I was very excited to receive the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set from Learning Resources for review.  My students LOVED this activity set.  It was in my small group centers for a couple of weeks.  They kept asking for it.  There were a lot of things that they liked about it.  They loved that they were like puzzles, especially since the mats are the shapes of bugs.  The boys especially loved this fact.  My students loved how brightly colored the shapes were and that there were many different shapes to play with.  As a teacher, there were many things I liked about the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set.  I loved the variety of shapes that are included.  I really like that the shapes are transparent.  This way the students can easily see if they have placed the shape correctly.  I really loved the variety of activities on the cards.  Some of the activities on the cards are placing the shape where it goes, combining shapes to make other shapes, and sorting the shapes by similar and different attributes.  These are things tShapes Don't Bug Me Collagehat students are required to learn in the kindergarten core curriculum.  I love that these activities applied directly to what my students are learning in class.  Most of all, I loved that my students loved to play with them.  I loved that the students were having fun but were learning as well!  This activity set would be great to have at home.  It teaches important shape concepts and the kids will love playing with it!

I'm pretty sure no one wants two different colored shoes.  The fit is smaller than expected.  This was an exchange for a bigger size and the bigger size cost twenty to thirty dollars more for the same shoe.  The shoes that were too small were very pretty.

0,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality. There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe. Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"

He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time.  I love the material and the look of it.  The only thing I would say is it's not just the front that's too tight but it is a bit loose on his face.  He says it's made of stretchy fabric and it's soft.  It's a nice color and I think it will be a great purchase for him.  I have no regrets about buying this.  We just love the quality of this sandal.This is my second pair of this brand of sandals.

I also like the fact that the sides are made of a metal material and not plastic. I would recommend them for anyone with an occasional rustic kitchen. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it works!  I used it to make a batch of a New England coffee for my son to make into a couple of quickies. He is very pleased with the design and the quality. I am happy with it and will buy it again. This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth it to keep it at a room temperature, but I have it on my mattress with no problems. I wish it had a small, low profile cover that was just right for my husband to put on his pillow for a few minutes of sleep."

1,"I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago. That was the last time I will be staying there. When I arrived, I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. They wanted at least $10. What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens. The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. The problem was with all of the down pillows etc. Don't they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. I think that this was another part of my symptoms. If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. Beware hidden costs. I will try somewhere else in the future. Not worth the money or the sneezing all night."

0,"I stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year. During the check in, the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation. I did not bring the confirmation with me because I had not been asked to present it in other places during check in.So she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key. I did what she told me and went to the bell station. However, people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key. A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk. I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes.

0,It worked great until about month and a half the light would stay on.  It would then go through all 3  light modes.  Couldn't turn it off.  Had to remove battery to shut it off.  It was very bright and nice when it worked.  I have always through streamlight was a good product but now don't know.  I am frustrated now paying that much money for a light that only lasted month and a half that now I have to send back to streamlight and wait.
0,Love this ladder.  You are able to get close to the area you are working on.  I recently used it to hang some drapes in my living room.  You can either have the ladder open with a four legs and be close to the work area or you can lean the ladder against the wall and use just as safely as you would with all four legs.  An additional feature is the middle section on the work top allows you to lean the ladder against a corner.  I added some photos of the ladder below.  I do recommend this ladder for personal or professional use.

The beds were large and extremely comfortable. The staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. From the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, I got the best customer service. The hotel was also conveniently located. It was within walking distance to the shopping center. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago."

The characters in the Emperor's Edge are strong and well drawn. The action is basically back-to-back, just the way I like it. The only criticism I can offer is one of personal taste: there was more introspection by the characters than I like, but it did not stop me from enjoying all 7 books. Well done, Ms."

Here's a quick example.  ""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""  That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.  Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass."

0,"If you are interested in getting a feeling for the awful events that plagued Rwanda during the genocide acts recently - this is a great presentation of the events, based on my knowledge. It is kind of documentary and drama blended together.  What is striking, given the date of this review, is just how ludicrous the world can be. It is shameful! People knew the events were taking place but with no oil or resources for nations to maul there was no interest to lend a hand. There are no acts of humanitarianism by super powers, just self fulfilling acts that benefit leaders of nations - self interest. Take the wikileaks for example that are surfacing today. The ""problem"" is the leaks? How can that be? The leaks are documents of criminal acts by leaders of governments - so why is the site questioned and not the leaders?  If you want to get a sense of international mismanagement - I feel we have the responsibility to do so, please watch this video. Other sources on the topic would include Darfur now, and The History and Sociology of Genocide (see below).  This video is a great entertaining presentation of an event we should not have to document.  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darfur-Now/dp/B0015XHR6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darfur Now</a>  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-and-Sociology-of-Genocide-Analyses-and-Case-Studies/dp/0300044461/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies</a>"

Everyone must make difficult choices, but in this case some become important in the whole scheme of things.

0,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.  Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.  Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.  The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.  The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over."

0,"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent). Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure. Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar. To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try."

There is at least one bad version and it's this one.  Cons: - Will not straighten out, not at all, it strongly insists on remaining curly, which makes it far less inconspicuous as it refuses to lie and kinks up - Pinches your fingers badly, really, really badly.  Seems impossible, I know, but seriously, it hurts.  The plastic they used is just wrong for this application, it's so stiff it I'm typing this on fingers that are raw from having to spread it open to put the cables inside. - It is NOT white, it's an off white, so it doesn't blend in as well with real white as it should.  Pros: - Umm, there seem very few alternative products... so I guess mere existence is a pro."

0,"My father read this book to me the first year it was published. I was nine and it has been on my bookshelf since. I can't tell you how many copies of this I have purchased for people. This is a great book to encourage thinking, not simply memorizing. Each page contains new language, new ideas, new ways to play with learning. It also happens to be a wonderful story. I may have been too young at nine to read it on my own, but certainly it is a great read-aloud for children nine or a bit younger. At nine, I didn't understand all the fancies, but like the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland, this book succeeds on many levels. The Phantom Tollbooth encourages a child's love for language. It paints wonderful pictures (with the help of Feiffer's charming line drawings). It is as perfect a thing as can be written. Oh, and if you're an adult without any children at home - buy the book for yourself. It will take you away from the Doldrums and into the Kingdom of Wisdom where your spirit can be renewed."

0,"This Novella was pretty fantastic.  The Submission of Alistair Ingram really hit it out of the park for me.  This is the Story of Black Betty(Bethany) a Dom at Dolls and Doms private mens club in Vegas and Alistair Ingram movie star.  Allistair meets Black Betty at his Bachelor Party at the exclusive club.  He leaves with a torn shirt and red marks on his chest.  Courtesy of Black Betty of course.  His Fiance Heather is not too happy about this turn of events.  Engagement broken and Black Betty thrown into the headlines as the other woman.  The only thing wrong with that is Black Betty has been hiding from her ex.  Now she needs to get away before she is found.    Now it seems to me that Black Betty(Bethany) has somewhat of a twisted past and she has been living as Black Betty to escape that.  Never confronting her fears or trusting anyone but herself.  Alistair on the other hand is a famous movie star and hasn't been able to dominate anything in his life as of lately.  So we find these two are more in like with each other than they want to be.  This truly is a story of facing your fears and moving on.  Learning to trust the one your with.  I loved Alistair more and more as the book went on.  Especially when he used his British accent.  How I love a British accent!  Black Betty too.  She was honest, brave, and loyal to a tee.    I am looking forward to see where these two are headed.  Big decisions in their future!  But here and now I hope they are enjoying their ride.  They both deserve to be happy."

I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.  A company can't entirely prevent malfunctions.

0,"Swisses Chicago: Nice, but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront. A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city, but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. No free WiFi here ,or affordable breakfast, or a free swim in the pool. Just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet, an on average $25 plate for breakfast, and another 15 bucks a night for the 'fitness center.' I've stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. Get with it - this is 2009! No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway, but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. Coffee, milk, OJ; stale donuts, ,muffins, maybe some cereal. Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. With regards to swimming, this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly. This all makes the $6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain. Summation: Drop the fees, the nickel dimming of folks, and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel."

0,"My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.  The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:  - There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.  - It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.  I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!  In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand."

0,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.  The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind."

As a 56 year old woman, I can say that the author really ""gets it"" about keeping the passion in your life way past what many people think you can.  It's a story that really appeals to women as it addresses the challenges of life, losing someone you truly adored, and then managing somehow to find somebody else who can fill the void in your life that you never thought could ever be found again.  In fact, if it was not for the light BDSM elements in the story, this could actually be made into a movie for Lifetime, Hallmark, or Up."

0,"Taming the Vampire is a wonderful read.  Liz is every bit the warrior she was bred to be while Jack is the perfect seductive vampire. Both on the hunt for a mysterious creature that has been leaving a trail of bodies in it's wake. Working together is not something either of the main characters want. For starters, Liz hates Jack and when her friend discovers a way to increase Liz's power, more than doubling her strength and giving her the tools she needs to defeat whatever it is that is lurking and killing in the shadows of Boston, she is repulsed. But after facing the demon on her own, and taking beating, Liz admits, she needs the help and goes Jack with an interesting proposal. If they have sex, she can absorb his power and become strong enough to kill the demon.  For a short paranormal romance, this book has spice and striking characters. As expected for this type of book, the pace was quick and never dull. However, as I was reading I felt as if this was a second book rather than a first in the series. The world building was a little weak, not much background was given of the hunters or the vampires and there wasn't much of an explanation given for what Absinthe really even is. Though, lack of world building has actually made me want to know more and I have already acquired book two, Bound by the Vampire. If you like paranormal romance and don't have the time to delve into a full length novel, I would recommend this series."

0,"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone. Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome. The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo. The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive. I enjoyed the film and the theme.  It held my interest and kept me watching."

The front desk staff, the concierge, the Star Bucks server, the restaurant, the lounge servers . . . all were wonderful! The rooms were spacious and the flat screen tv was really great! The bath room was a real plus ... it was huge and had everything one desires. Great view from 20th floor to Michigan Avenue below! Overall, great stay and highly recommended!"

0,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him? I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow."

It's a small office and so we are have constant contact with each other and I have found it hard to strike the right balance between friend and boss. Many times I have felt uncomfortable when wanting to address something with one of my employees. This book has been invaluable to me in that it has given me a lot to think about and put into action. I like that there is a timeline so there are different questions to ask myself each day so that I just don't do a 180 in 24 hours. My employees may just walk out on me then!  This book really made me identify to myself why I am the boss, what skills I possess to help this business and to take ownership of that. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to work on their management skills!  The author asked me to read and review this book and I am so glad he did. This is my honest review and I highly recommend the book."

He takes us from one end of the emotional scope to the other. The story is fast paced and you never know what's going to be thrown at you next.

I wasn't happy to find an item my dog could have choked on in her ""safety"" area; I simply reattached it using crazy glue.

0,"I am a hot sleeper! My husband tells me that my body gives off so much heat that I'm like a furnace. That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow. I would not sleep on it alone though, I put it on top of my other pillow and it's perfect.

0,"Looked at the top 4 brands of these: Wagon, Koolatron, Cooluli,and Igloo. Didn't necessarily ever need warm and didn't want to wait 5 weeks for delivery so that eliminated one. Then after looking at reviews bought Coleman and Igloo to compare and a generic converter (Shumacher 6v) since it looked like they didn't come with any. (Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons: 1. Cord came off the unit completely as shown in photo 2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf 3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best 4. Shelf  Loaded cooler the day before travel to save time morning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: Forgot the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.  Awesome item. Saves time, money, food, and don't know why I never got one before! Simple.  No loading ice every day and repacking the cooler."

Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience."

0,"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.  It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.  Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I. Go get one today!"

0,"I absolutely love this Black Dome Tungsten Ring.  I wanted to get my hubby a wedding band that is different and unique.  I fell in love with this one, it is solid black and polished.  This ring looks so good and is made very well.  I got a size 9 which fits my hubby perfectly.  I have a ring sizer at home and this ring was sized exactly.  The ring is heavy for a normal ring, but that is expected from a tungsten ring.  He says it fits and rests comfortable on his finger.  Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.  This ring is very durable and will last the test of time.  It has a nice polish and since he has been wearing it, the polish has held up really nicely.  He does a lot of hard labor and nothing has scratched it.  I completely recommend this ring.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

0,"Wow. This for me is just vastly better than War and Peace. Instead of trying to sketch the entire Russian world, here he focuses in on 2-3 interrelated families. The psychological depth Tolstoy creates for Anna, Vronsky, Levin and all the rest of these people is just incredibly vivid. You feel their insecurities and longings like they're your own. The dialogue, both internal and external, is fantastic, and each character feels so real, so totally brimming over with this little moments of honesty and pathos. And the whole thing is grounded in small sensory details which make this whole world come vividly alive on almost every page, whether its a description of a nightgown flapping in the breeze, or the sensations of a hunter walking through the woods before dawn. There's no end of life in this book. Sorry to gush so much, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best crafted, most perfectly balanced 'big' 19th century books I've ever read. I'd recommend this to anyone"

0,"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere. What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor. The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts. Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them."

I was excited by the great location (on East Chestnut Street downtown), but this was a mediocre hotel for the price ($250 per night before taxes). The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters, and yes, the view of downtown in the distance was pretty, but I was very disappointed. The bedding seemed to be polyester, not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately. When I ordered room service at 10:30 (on a Thursday night), I had to wait for 55 minutes, 20 minutes longer than I was quoted.

It smells like chemicals. I thought the smell would dissipate after a few days.. I was wrong. Also, if you have pets you can see just about every bit of hair on it. I wished I wouldn't of purchased this but it's too late. Not absolutely horrible- just not for me.  ***UPDATE 6/1/16*** I am truly regretting this rug especially in this color!! . Every little speck of dust and animal hair and shows up and it always looks dirty even after I vacuum it. I have a great vacuum so I definitly know that's not the problem."

0,"Excellent pair of leggings! Much warmer than regular leggings which may be because of the ribbing. The elasticity is excellent, they are a great length also! I am only 5'2 so they are a bit long but I just cuff the bottom under and it's fine!  I know that taller women often have issues finding leggings of a decent length but these would be great if you are taller! The color is not a dark black but more of a smoky black. Super comfy and the pockets are an added plus so they look more like pants but have the elastic waistband of leggings. The first pair I ordered had a tiny hole on the leg but I messaged Amazon and received a replacement pair within 2 days without having to return the others first! So I am very pleased!"

0,"Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services. First of all, from reading other reviews, now I know I got ripped @ $249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $79 (albiet, I got free wifi). The hotel is nice; but it can only get so nice for an oldie...no matter how much money you dump into it. Shower head was really low (I'm 6'1'), water pressure was low. It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by (check out reviews on Yelp!) For some off reason I ended up with two double beds (they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone). If traveling here: 1 - make sure you get a better deal than I did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - Don't have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class (although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple...it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers (sp?) trying to save money."
1,"The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me. I chose it because it a Hilton hotel, but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name. My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff. My room might have been luxurious years ago, but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening. The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible. The food served by the room service and at the hotel's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus, and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine. The food simply did not deliver its promises. Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small. The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage, since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions: however, the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by. Overall, this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range."

0,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for. Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen. ""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe. Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending. There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more. To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece."

1,"Wow. I expected better from this author, but it just wasn't.  The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed. The main character, Zachary, is a rich man who has been with the military for many years, and is also a military-minded man who feels that he is a part of something larger than himself.  But he is not.  He is a man who is not his father, but is the son of a man who is not his father."

1,"If anyone is traveling to Chicago, I would strongly recommend the Palmer House Hilton. I have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and I was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel. I had a guest room with a double bed. At the first sight, the room had perfect decor. The double bed looked comfy and cozy. It wasn't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me. Since I was in a hurry in my two-day stay, I didn't have time to wander around the town for food. It wasn't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks. The good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night. I can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks. If you are just touring the city, the hotel is quite close to parks, museum, and a lot of shopping places. If you just need a place to stay, the view from the hotel was pretty good as well. Among all the hotels I have spent time in, the Palmer House Hilton tops the list."

Sloan's ptsd episode causes a major break in the relationship and he no longer trusts himself with Lexi but she still trusts him but can't get him to listen to her. Book 3 was a kind of journey to self discovery for the characters both individually and together as a couple. Both Sloan and Lexi began therapy and they started to move on with life. They both had to deal with things from the past, including Victoria and Aaron. I was worried that they would not get the ending I felt they deserved but it all worked out in the end."

'2012' has whacky characters, I love Yellowstone blowing up and the DJ broadcasting it live, a strong compassionate black president, oddly constructive so you're kept guessing as to what the govs are up to, some realism about 'who' would get picked to survive, and lots of visual images of crumbling various national landmarks.

My wife couldn't handle the smell of the room so I asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else. They refused and were very rude and unhelpful.

0,"Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier works.  Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warriors from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  ""gwali.""  The princes of the realm are handsome and heroic, their  princesses beautiful and spirited.  The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a storyline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight or substance to the  tales, and harbor some doubts that the ""Riftwar Saga"" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests. Nonetheless I  will admit that so far Feist's stories do offer facile moments of unadorned  diversion and amusement."

0,"My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel. The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. The rest of the staff however was terrible. When we first checked in, I was instantly discouraged. The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn't wait to leave the lobby. Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. At one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. Even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. Yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. For how much money we paid for each night, I would have rather stayed somewhere else. We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews, but we did not experience any of this during our stay. The rooms were alright, but nothing special. I would not stay in this hotel again."

It collapses to easily (just while playing), the gears do not stay on- as soon as you turn either on the end they ALL pop off, and the nails pretty much fall right into the holes. If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy). If you have a toddler that is more interested in tinkering rather than necessarily playing (like my little guy), check out Speedy, NOT this workbench!"
0,"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and works OK. It also has a magnetic ball marker that slides off when you press the bottom of it (it has a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with team logos or other options offered by the manufacturer). The top end features an indent to hold a club, just above the magnet designed to catch bottle caps pulled off by the bottle opener (flip it over to use as a can opener). The 6th use of this is to hold cigars, something I would not use myself but which I suppose some golfers may have use for. This tool is nice to have and it is solid, so it should offer many years of use as long as you don't lose it. The shiny gold finish may not last, but while it does it will make the tool stand out in the green. One thing I do suggest is that Amazon place this in the sporting category rather than home goods, where it is currently listed. While it opens bottles and cans, the main purpose is divot repair, which people would search for in sporting goods."
0,"Having enjoyed the first 'Elizabeth' so much, I was prepared to be disappointed in the second. It was reviewed as more concerned with costuming than acting. Call me crazy, I loved it. Cate Blanchett is a powerful Elizabeth. At no point did I feel the costumes outweighed the cast. While the first movie is still my favorite, I wouldn't have missed this."

1,"I bought this kennel to use on my cat and it is a nice size for him. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not easy to slip it on. The carpet is very thick and it is very easy to clean. It is very easy to clean and it has a very soft feel to it. I also like that it has a pull handle to keep it on. I like that it is so easy to put on and take off. The only thing I would change is that I put it in a larger size box and put it in a closet where it would be easier for me to get it off. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate. I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be. He is very active and has not gotten into fights with other people. I have used this product for a few months now and he seems to be able to get used to it. It is easy to set up and I can use it on my dogs. I would recommend this product. I have had a lot of troubles with my cat. He will eventually get bored with this toy and will eat it. But he loves it."

I have had to buy two of these with no problems. They are the perfect size for the dog and it is a great deal. I just wish there was a collar for it too. I have a 60lb terrier mix and this collar is perfect for him. I use it everyday for training, she just loves to run with it and runs like crazy. It fits perfectly in my hand and my dog is just as excited as she is to run with it. She runs with it a lot and it is super easy to put on and off. I have no complaints about this collar.

Cassie having to deal with the ramifications of her assault and Cody's reaction that results with him being temporarily separated from her.

0,"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.  Pros: 1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets 2) A cute penguin theme  Cons: 1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What might fix this is to have both sides be magnetic: one side - game board, one side - staging area. And put the game options on harder cardboard that flip out the top and bottom.  2) The solutions. I wish they were somehow hidden or in another section. I've worked with my kid on ""it's not as much fun if you don't figure it out on your own"" but once he figured out that the solutions were in the back - he just spent his time copying the solutions. I don't even know how to address this one - I gave him to toy to entertain him while we were setting up and breaking down camp and for the car, in lieu of a screen, so I couldn't sit there and play with him."

0,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.  The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:  First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.  The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.  So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."

1,"I recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a high-end hotel. I was in Chicago for a conference, and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to, but this hotel definitely wasn't that place. The restaurants were mediocre at best, despite their high prices; I repeatedly got food that was bland, overcooked, or lukewarm. The room was fine, but nothing special; I think I'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago. A big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel, though, was with their Jet Set Pets program; it's hard to find a decent, relaxing hotel that I'll like that will also accept my dog. But many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt, who is energetic and loves people but isn't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he's got that terrier look. Multiple people mocked him, or said there was no point grooming him, or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. I know that it's a fairly high-end hotel, but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. I hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. The experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory, especially for the price. I can give them good marks on their spa services, and I really appreciated the pillow 'menu,' but other than that it didn't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience, especially given the customer service."

0,"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.  Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!  This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.  The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.  I highly recommend this unit to anyone."
0,"What I like most about this is the amount of water that it holds.  As a mom, I used to have to fill the kids water guns or risk my wood floors being drenched with water that they spill when filling.  This holds a lot of water!  I bought one for my son's friend, because whenever he came over, he'd beg to wear it or drench my floors with spilled water from his small canister that comes with his Nerf water gun.  My only word of caution is that since water is heavy, either don't let a real small kid wear it or only fill it up partially.  My kids were 7 and 9 when we first used this and they both promised it did not feel too heavy.  You can fill it up until you think it is a good weight for your child.  My kids also add ice cubes to make it a frozen blast.  I also like how it get's them outside for hours and they can cool off with the blasts."

1,"This movie will make you cry. The movie is just too graphic. There is a lot of blood and gore. Some of the parts are disgusting and the fight scenes are great. The movie is a little hard to watch. Some of the scenes are disturbing and some of the scenes are downright shocking. The only thing I can say is that the movie is not for the average person. I wish there were more movies like this out there. The story line is a little confusing and the characters are very strange. It is not for everyone, but I am not a huge fan of the movie. I am a big fan of the anime genre, but I can't say enough good things about this movie.I'm a huge fan of the WW2 movie genre.

I have had no issues with the blade.  I have used it with a saw and it is very smooth and smooth.  It has also been very easy to install.  I used it to hold a cutt down fence in a wooded area to cut into wood.  The saw will cut out a 2-4"" strip of wood and then it will put it back together and hold it in place.  It is a very durable tool.  The saw does a good job of holding and holding the strip in place.  It has a very smooth cut and the saw is very sharp.  I would recommend this saw for anyone.I really like these. They are great for taking a shower. They are very bright and they are very small. They fit my shower head perfectly.

0,"Like any film instructor, I'm always seeking an affordable text for my students. With the average text hovering around $80.00 (and then the additional charge for supplemental books), The Lean Forward Moment seemed like a steal. I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewers here, I'm a bit confused as to whom the target-audience is.  The simple, jargon-free language appeals to the lay-person (which is always welcome in texts geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concepts give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn was attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious.  I know that it seems superficial, but one of the ways I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through its examples. I know (for a fact) that my students excitedly scan a text ... looking for stills from works they know/love. The Lean Forward moment uses many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choices to get the cinema-neonate involved. On the flip side, Across the Universe, Brazil, Synecdoche, Contempt, Coons, Jack in the Box, Satacracy 88 -- these niche/obscure works are interesting to more advanced students (maybe). (And, now we're back to that gray-zone ...).  Here's my professional opinion, The Lean Forward Moment is fantastic for the intermediate student who knows the fundamentals, will be entertained by familiar examples, and is curious about lesser known works."

0,"I am crushed because I LOVED this book, and looked forward to the movie since I read it when it came out!  I am crushed because despite the anger I have I liked the move but I am crushed because I also hated it!  The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!  The movie makes no sense, even my wife who had not read the books said it feels incomplete and half-made...  I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...  The director destroyed the heart and soul of this book by taking the MAIN story line out, and lightening it up! I am surprised J.K. Rowling did not step in and say NO you ruined my book!  I am severly upset about this!  They need to be forced to fix this!"

1,"I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend, and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. The spacious rooms with modern, innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small, dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. The bathrooms were neat, tidy, and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper, shampoo, and soap. The carpet was clean (not stained and dingy like some hotels), the room decor was astounding, and the view from our window was wonderful. I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay, from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. Thanks for making me feel right at home!"

0,"This movie reminded me of several episodes I saw on Law and Order and Special Victims regarding children sociopaths. It wasn't difficult to see that Kevin had a serious behavioural problem early on, as a viewer it was quite clear.  However, as a parent it would be very difficult to admit your child had little or no conscience  at all and was capable of committing such heinous acts.  My heart went out to Tilda Swinton for trying to deal with a child she realized had serious problems, with no one to turn to for help or guidance, it was quite hopeless.  I got the feeling from the start of her pregnancy and after the birth she never seemed happy about motherhood.  The question presents itself. Are the mother's feelings transferred to the child during pregnancy?  I recommend this movie to those who like realistic but difficult subject matter."

I highly recommend it for any child who likes to play with toys. This toy is amazing. It's the perfect size for my little girl and she loves it! She loves it.

0,"Keyboard cover review  I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.  The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.  I like having the cover. I like how super thin it is and the protection it offers. Typing with any keyboard cover requires some getting used to. I really wish the letters and number on each key were illuminated, thats my only complaint."

1,"Last week, I booked a 'Deluxe Suite' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago. I took the 'Retreat and Relax' package deal. The wait to check in was intolerably long, because they were letting some people check in with a dog. I'm allergic to dogs, and I'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. They insisted on escorting me to to my room, every time I came in, like I was going to break into another guest's room or something. I swear, anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks, asking me if I needed anything. You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something. I went to the pool, but it was full of screaming children. When I went to bed, I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. And what's worse, they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. They threatened to throw me out on the street, after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars! I had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it. Also, their on-site restaurant is too expensive, given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. The food should be free! I wouldn't stay here again, it was a waste of my money."

I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:  Pros: - it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining. - very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes. - it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch. - comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use. - Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it. - No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus. - let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.  Cons: - It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue. - It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here. - There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.  Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it."

1,"Five stars for functionality. It works. The only problem is that it's not really a stereo, but a pair of ear buds. The ear buds don't fit comfortably in the ear, so it's a little difficult to pair them. If you have a pair of ear buds, you may need to put them on your head and them on the head and then adjust the volume/angle. I just turned the volume up to the right and it didn't work.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to use headphones, but for people who are just looking for a pair of ear buds, this might be a good option.I bought this to use on my iPad mini 2 and it works perfectly.

Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!  My review was not affected by the discount I received and is fair and unbiased."

0,"Director Gilliat fashioned this atmospheric, intelligent murder mystery, beautifully restored and available for the first time via the Criterion Collection. ""Green"" maintains foreboding throughout, leavened by the superlative Sim's dry wit.

My four year old is very interested in it and we have attempted to play with it several times. The felt puzzle pieces that create the roads come apart very easily. This causes many problems as one begins to construct the city unless you are very delicate. The city itself must be built on a flat surface, so no carpet. This is very challenging with my two year old around. Even if she wasn't there to knock things over, it seems like it would be difficult to play with the city once set up. It is not designed to be very sturdy."

I felt bad for her being caught between two of the most important men in her life.  I found Jason and Drew's interactions to be fascinating .  There is a lot of history there and it made for some tense moments as well as emotional ones.  However, only part of it was shared and I'm hoping we'll get more if/when we get Jason's story.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this series develop and getting to know more about the band members and their stories.

This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance.

0,"First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.  These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?). Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.  Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.  Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch  I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.  I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!  As such, I cannot recommend these"
0,"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that."

I can only think she tried to force it when one of the sides was slightly misaligned and that's what led to the pieces coming off but I haven't had that issue.  I spend $20 bucks on the original rubix cube at some planetarium so I was happy to find this better version for half the price."

0,"After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo, I decided to give this hotel a try. I must say it was a great choice! The location is perfect, just off from N Michigan Ave, walking distance from everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was excellent. They gave us a corner room w/a great view. As many have posted, the bed & pillows were very comfortable (I am very picky about that). I slept well every night! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. I highly recommend this hotel."

1,"I liked this book. I have read all the other books in the series, and this one is a keeper. The story is well told, the characters are interesting, and the story is well told. I would highly recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. I love a good mystery with a good twist. I have read all of the other books in the series. This one is a little different and I am not sure why I didn't give it a five star rating. I would have liked it a little better. I just didn't get it. It is definitely a book I will read again. This is a wonderful book about a man who is at the top of his game. He has a heart of gold and a love for his country. He is determined to make a good life for himself and his family. He has always believed that his country would be better off if he was free. He has always believed that there is no other way but to make a life for himself. This book is filled with stories of men, women, and children who have made a difference in their country. It is a great book to read and remember. It is a wonderful story about a man who has a heart of gold."
1,"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.  The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.  The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.  Henry Ewing's father was very good at sports, but his mother was a bit too shy and a bit too violent.  In the movie, Ewing is a bit of a troublemaker who"

0,"My last camcorder was sharp mini camcorder and I hate to buy tapes.  This camcorder sounds like a perfect fit.  I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.  I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.  Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.  I guess that I can't complain too much since I paid $300 for this camcorder but maybe if the quality is as good as advertised (even outdoors) I would give it 4 stars or more."

0,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.  It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.  The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.  This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.  Incidentally, the story does not involve clothing or any form of haberdashery."

They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them. The Ipod dock was not working either.

Also received an incorrect folio under my door(another guests that was staying at this location). I called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected. I opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later.

0,"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.  These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.  I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.  I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions.

And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service. Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)  But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research.

On the other hand, technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators (but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me, why change)? In any case, I want to take a nice hot soak and--guess what--they are having water problems... SOOOOO disappointed. Hopefully I don't get bug bitten this time (checked under the sheets). Sadly, due to my company's deal, I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh*...but so far they are batting 1 star.... -------------- Oh boy, it must be my luck...or rather this hotel is just run down. I had to swap room FOUR TIMES. And that's for a Thurs nite-Sunday morning stay. My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms. They gave me the key to the 2nd room, which happened to be occupied. Luckily the occupants had their security latch on, so there wasn't any embarrassing moment. My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today (just now) I had to move because of water leakage (above my room and below my room). BOY, talk about an awful hotel (or my just awful luck???? Maybe it's karma since I wrote a bad review last year, and continue to write one...but it's the TRUTH). Oh, also last year may not have been bed bugs. I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg.

0,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand I'm sure it will stay with me, if only because it has provided me with a vivid picture of what the mental life of somebody I know may be like. On the other hand I did not care for the writing ...  ... starting with the title, whose intriguing promise is not in any way, that I can see, kept, Naturally the title brings to mind Sherlock Holmes. And the connection is indeed drawn in the book, which, very annoyingly to my mind, relates the main plot of the relevant Conan Doyle novel, which I would have been motivated to reread after all these years had it only been alluded to rather than completely revealed (and to no good purpose that I can see). And what does it have to do with THIS novel? Not much. Just about the only plot element that was keeping me interested was the detective mystery, but, bizarrely, this is blown up rather early in the game ... admittedly thereby introducing a different and also intriguing plot element, but not intriguing enough to assuage my disappointment at the demise of the detective element.  The writing is lacking also in that there are contradictions in the text and sometimes the characters do things that I simply could not believe.  The main problem with the writing, though, is one of the things that gives the book its strength, namely, conveying what I presume is an autistic-like mind. Unfortunately the author is not enough of a stylist to prevent me from mentally shouting, OK, enough already, I get it. It became tedious for most of my read.  I will credit the book and story with a strong double message: It shows that some people are capable of unconditional love (and some are not), and happiness is not to be found."
0,"I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.  Oh, and the magnets on the earbuds are a nice bonus."

While the game is complex, the rules and game play are straight-forward and after a few minutes you and your kids will have the hang of it. Imagine the card game War plus a little Magic; The Gathering and some Pokemon, and that's Brave Rat! The best part of this game is that it's a new game every time you play! Because the cards come in a small tin this is a perfect game for travel!"
1,"man lets get honest here, and it's an interesting insight into how people make decisions about their own lives.  The film is also a solid film, as you watch the great actors and actresses that make up this great movie.  The story is told as it is, and the characters are believable.  And the acting is wonderful, as the characters do not speak out so much in this film.  This is not a film for children.  I don't think it is for everyone, but I would recommend this film to anyone.I love this series.  I just love them.  They are all real life.  The characters are all real.

0,"WOW!! Where do I start? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown. Check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge. The king bed was very comfortable. Our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. Even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. The room did show some signs of wear, but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. The hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. There is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets, with all the nightlife, and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the Hancock building. By staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. Had breakfast at the Pump Room, which is a story in itself. We had our photo taken in booth 1. Take some time and research who has sat in this booth. It is impressive. Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room. Didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but I will return for dinner someday. Breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. I can't wait to return here!"

I will be reading the next one in the series. I love this book. I can't wait to read the next one. I loved this book. It was very well written and I was so excited to get to the end. I just couldn't get into it and am glad I did. I love the way the author takes the time to explain the book and the characters, the stories and the twists and turns. I also like the way the author describes the people, the language, the people of the book. I especially loved the way she describes the people of the book. It was very easy to relate to as a reader. I also liked the way the author describes the characters and the scenes. I am always interested in this author and this book is a keeper. I would have liked this book more if it had more of a mystery element to it. It was a bit of a mystery and not very exciting, but it was good enough."
1,I got this toaster for my 9 year old son. He loves it! He loves to throw the other two at the kid. The only problem is the plastic is so thin it's hard to put it back on. The kid can't use it as a kitchen sink. The kids also love to put the other two at the kitchen sink. The kids also love to play with the microwave and just pretend to make fun sounds. The kids really like it! It's very easy to put together.

I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the previous full novels in the series, I say you should read this short story for completeness if nothing else.  It is really worth the read because it seems to give details that will probably matter later in the series.  Have at it because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The characters are good as always.  I already started the next book at the time I am typing this review because this story was so short."

One of them is disdainful towards any kind of scratching post -- but the other has ripped through several of the inexpensive $9 throw-away boxes. In fact there are at least two or three of them spread through the house, not counting the little crunchies left behind from enthusiastic scratching.  When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.  Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.  Fortunately as other reviewers have reported, it's constructed very well, with the cardboard FAR more dense than in the cheap scratching boxes you're thinking of. I won't need to replace this for a good long time."

0,"I liked this book but I didn't love it! I had some issues with Allie. To me a lot of the time she came across as self-centered, snobby and judgmental! I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers. I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book! Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!! I will however read Darius and Taylor's story."
0,"""Riddley Walker"" is a post-apocalyptic roadmovie telling the story of its eponymous hero intertwined with the legend of St. Eustace and a bow to Punch & Judy. This unlikely combination serves as the backdrop to a coming-of-age story written entirely in phonetic slang with a healthy helping of dialect based on guesswork as to what terminology might survive. Getting used to Riddley's language takes some effort, but is well worth it, as his observations on society and long-forgotten history unfold.  The Riddley Walker Annotations Web Site (...) is warmly recommended for additional information and insights."

0,"I purchased this light when it was on sale for $29.00 and I wish I had ordered more because I love it and all my friends love it. When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door. Update!  I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully: Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors."

0,"I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel. It seems as though I had the same experience as 'Judy L.' I read her review and thought 'that's exactly what happened to me!' Here's what happened: The good news: The actual event was great. Most notably, the food was absolutely incredible; I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food. The same goes for the cake, which was made by Take the Cake. The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good. The bad news: Michelle, the Director of Catering, honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare. While we were negotiating the contract, she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls; after the contract was signed, it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered, to schedule the tasting, etc. She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email, and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time. I assumed things would get better within the month--or even the week--prior to my wedding, but they actually got even worse. Michelle just could not get it together, and if it weren't for my wedding coordinator's assistance in forcing her to finally get things right, I don't know what would have happened. Thus, if it weren't for Michelle's inability to do her job, I would have had a great experience. But, as it is, when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel, I unfortunately have very negative thoughts. And that's incredibly disappointing, considering it was a major part of the best night of my life."

0,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man... Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey. While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books. By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."

The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either. When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key. When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made. The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food. We ended up going home two days before we planned.

1,"I bought these scrubs for my wife and she loves them.  She also loves the way they look.  She had to get a size down but the fit was perfect.  The only thing I would say is that the size is way too small.  If you are short, you can get a size down.  If you are medium, you can get a size up.  I just wish there was a way to go by the size.  It's very easy to find scrubs in stores and I have no complaints.I love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit great. They are soft and comfortable. I have to get them in a size 8 and they stay on my feet. They also have a nice stretch and arch support. I am 5'7 and the size 8 is perfect. I have a large in the lower back, so I wear a medium.

I have a hard time finding jeans that have stretchy, very comfortable, and I find that these jeans tend to fall apart when I wear them all day long.

0,"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.  But boy, I could not have been more wrong.  This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.  (Just don't leave it standing in your living room if you have cats.  Because it I discovered it works pretty well as a scratching post, too!)"

1,"This is a fine piece of filmmaking, with a lot of twists and turns. I was surprised to find that the film is very much based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little bit of a stretch to think about the book and Doyle's characters. The book is a bit too long, and it's a bit over the top. There are some great twists and turns in the book, but there's not much to it. It's very much a matter of style, and it's not about the character. There is some action, but it's a little too fast and predictable. I really liked the movie, and I found it to be a fun ride.I have been a fan of ""The Mummy"" for years. I've watched it many times and have enjoyed it the most.

1,"Great Disposer, We had an old house and the tools were all in a box. I was just starting to get tired of the plastic bags. The box was filled with a lot of metal and it was hard to get the tools out. I had to use some of the tools with the edge of the tool to get it out. The box was very heavy so I had to get some extra tools to get it out of the box. I ended up using a bit of a small bit of wood to get the tools out. They were very well made and the tool bag was very easy to use. The tool bag is very heavy so it takes a lot of work to get it out of the box."

0,"The Gideon Affair  Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.  Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.  And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.  Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.  You will feel a variety of emotions reading this story but I promise you, you will enjoy every minute of it!"

It had a chemical smell when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it along with the shams, no more problem there.  And it washed up beautifully - no shrinkage at all. It is a very colorful and rich look for our guest bedroom. You could use just about any color of sheets with this and it will look great. I like having a quilt instead of my usual comforter sets because of the fact that it is easily washable at home - and if you have kids or pets, that is a good thing."

It was a really cool game, had a good storyline, good graphics, was challenging enough to keep me interested, and the overall game play was pretty sweet.  My sister also loved it a lot.  She thought it was one of the best games she's ever played.  So when this one came out I decided to buy it for her.  She has been trying to get the platinum trophy for PSN ever since."

1,I had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad. When we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king. This was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment. We were offered a free dinner which we accepted. The restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good. The tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair. This took about an hour to resolve. Overall we would not pick this hotel again. They should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition. We feel it was not a good value.

I would recommend this to anyone. I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she loves it! She is a little rough with it but she has had no problems with it. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too hard for her to put together. She is 5 and she loves it. I ordered this for my 6 year old son for Christmas. He loves it. We had fun building it on his own. He has learned a lot from the pieces and I think it will be a great addition to his collection. I think it is a good size for a small child. My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train. He plays with this every day."

0,"OK, we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating. I can't believe the bad reviews. I got a priceline deal, and I still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (OK a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. Here it is from my point of view. Both rooms on 10th floor. Regarding the size of the rooms. We had two rooms. One was a 2 double bed room. It was about 20' x 15'. Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. The furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. Three separate levels (TV, ice/coffee, and minibar) The other room was called 'Queen executive'. This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two TVs and terry bathrobes. Also about the same size but different configerations. One TV faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. Smoke in the lobby. There is a bar to the right of the entrance. It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. Cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint. Concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does. Was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? Either case, not good. He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect."
0,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew's birthday and it was a hit. He especially loves the way it changes his voice. It is not always clear, but still is a lot of fun. The prerecorded phrases and ""breathing"" sound are very realistic. It came with demo batteries, but they did not work, so we had to take it out of the package and put new batteries in it. The instructions consist of pictures only, so it was a little confusing as to where the batteries go. We actually took the wrong cover off (it was the forehead pad) thinking the batteries were under it, and it broke in the process, but it was easily glued back on. As with any electronic toy for a 6 year old, I'm not sure how long this will hold up, but so far, he loves it."

Character development is spot-on, and the depth of information about the challenges faced by Appalachian Miners is very revealing.  I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.  I was also disappointed as I expected some follow-up editorial information/direction regarding the plight of the miners. Was it fully fact-based, an entertaining, yet trumped-up piece of fiction, or something else entirely?"

They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.  This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.  A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them. Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.  The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.  A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring."
0,"This is a tough one to review... as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average.... 2 is where it was. Here are my tips and props/complaints: Room: 1 Star. I had a corner suite. The room was pretty nasty actually (2703..STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!). There was a CONSTANT banging noise from above. When I first got in I thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding. After an hour, I knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong. Well, the sound continued on for 3 days. Not that I minded too much as I keep things on for white noise... but it sure would bug others. Also, there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa. In addition, it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa. Also, there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat. I could not imagine all the DNA left on that thing either. *gags* Bathroom: Nice size but not great. The faucet was lose (really lose) and the toilet would not flush right. Service: Great. Everyone I encountered did a great job making me feel welcome. Good stuff. Food: I had meetings there, so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made. It was really good... much better than most hotels. Bar: Very cool. Good music, great service and good drinks. The scene was decent as well. Small bar, but was not cramped. So, maybe other rooms are nicer... well hell they better be. Regardless, if ONE room is like that (especially a 'suite'), I have to think others are like that as well. It is too bad though. The views are great and they actually have windows that open... big shocker for the city in general!"

0,"It's a good message, and the illustrations are really captivating, but the story is very didactic. The message is very clearly ""be yourself"", and it hits you over the head with that. The illustrations are fun to look at. If it weren't for the heavy-handedness of the message it would be a really good book.  The story is reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. There's a girl who really likes lima beans, but nobody else likes lima beans so she always lies and says she doesn't because she's super worried about what everybody thinks of her. Because of that, she starts changing colors based on what other people want her to be. This expands to changing shape, and then becoming even more surreally assimilated into all the furniture and decorations in her bedroom. At the very end, a little old woman says, ""I bet you want some lima beans,"" and the girl says, ""No! Nobody likes lima beans! Wait, never mind I like lima beans!"" And then she eats the lima beans and everything is fixed. Ugh. The message is so obtrusive.  For more children's book reviews, see my website at drttmk dot com."

0,"We bought this steam vac for my mother-in-law since my husband broke her other hoover steam vac. We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).  The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.  It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.  So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use."

0,"UPDATED Mon June 20, 2016 for Grammatical and Structural Issues:  ORIGINAL REVIEW WRITTEN IN 2002:  This is an entertaining book, once again not for people under the age of 12, because of some of the content, but Meg Cabot has this way of writing in making all these situations hilarious while mixing just the right amount of Fantasy and Reality together and one hilarious story that while fantastical is a reflection of real life as a teenager.   I was unable to put this book down (it was truly a struggle when I did have to take a break from reading it). That is a true rarity in books, this is not like a classic nor will it ever be, but it essentially good pulp romance for teens, something teens should be able to enjoy  for years to come.  I suggest you read the first, and then read this. Do not watch the movie then read this book because the premise and story of both book and movie are 100% dissimilar.  Not a book to take seriously, but a great piece of fantasy to take your mind off of the real world for a bit.  God Bless ~Amy  PS: SHE'D BETTER GET WITH MICHAEL SOON!!!"

0,"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!  The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.  The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.  Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them."

0,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.  With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.  Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.  I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have."
0,"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.  With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door,  it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.  The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parents  I served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.  The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."

0,"I finally picked up the black version off of Woot for a great price. The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well."
0,"This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure. The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners. The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian. While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, the Ritz and Park Hyatt, it falls short. We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection. While the prices were similar to the Peninsula, we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try. Wow, were we ever disappointed. First off, we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7. OK, thats fine and we sat down. The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong, so that she could make it right. When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ($20 per glass), she consulted with the manager and then another manager (a heavier fellow in a dark suit). She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses. What bothers me is not the outcome, but the fact that the management is not service focused. At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula, this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure, it would be made right. At the Conrad, the Terrace manager just ignored it."

0,"This is an interesting product; kind of a cross between wax and silicone.  It can be used as a polish and also as a sealer/barrier to keep surfaces from oxidizing.  It's a small container, but should last a long time.  The best uses I have found are on objects that are a combination of wood and metal; it can be used on both.  So polishing a gun or knife can be a one step process.  I also used it on a newly purchased wooden work bench to help protect it.  Overall a good buy and great for home/automotive use."

She goes to the local police department to talk to them about the Penelope, but she isn't given any other information.

It's not ground-breaking; if you've read McCullough's _John Adams_, or Ellis's own _Passionate Sage_, you'll find most of this information familiar. However, Ellis's approach is a good one: this is a biography not of John, nor of Abigail, but of John-And-Abigail. There's a lot of good, well-researched character development, and a nicely nuanced view of this ever-evolving relationship. It might be a little less compelling for readers who are unfamiliar with the Adamses or the period."

0,"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product. I do wish they were less expensive; but we need them, so we buy them."

It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).  I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.  I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.  I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on."

The heating in our room was loud, making it difficult to sleep. The gym is not big enough, and the hotel parking garage is very expensive. The hotel has so many guests that the lobby was too loud to relax in. We didn't get great service at the hotel bar, and the bar ran out of bar snacks because so many people were in the bar area.

0,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).  'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).  In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')  As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."

I'm not sure if they will stretch as I wear them out of the house though. I would probably order the smaller size, but I'm not sure how long it will hold up.  If you have a wide butt, it is not as big as I thought it would be.

If anything, the section on how the collapse of WTC1 and WTC2 was made more clear with the explanations supplied with the excerpted footage from Explosive Evidence than Explosive Evidence itself.  Where this documentary fell down was in the omission of Silverstein's PBS interview where he freely admitted that WTC7 was deliberately imploded, which was one of the few actual pieces of evidence given in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Myth-and-The-Reality-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000VRF4C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11: The Myth and The Reality - 2 DVD Set</a>.  The other glaring issue was the allegation that pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma were running rampant in the wake of the destruction of WTC1 and WTC2.  Problem:  asbestos-induced interstitial fibrosis and mesothelioma have very clear latency times of 20 years after the date of first exposure.  If such an epidemic is to happen, it will not happen for another 45 months from the time this review is written.  Also, mesothelioma already occurs in 1/1,000,000 people each year WITHOUT prior asbestos exposure.  If these diagnoses in past cases are correct, there are some equally disturbing causes: either a) there was prior exposure well ahead of 9/11, or b) there are additional toxic materials not previously identified to the public used in the construction of WTC1 and WTC2."

Dr Perlmutter makes it very hard to dispute that grains are not great for our bodies. Definitely worth a read.
0,"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.  I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.  The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage."

Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.  I like the style and apparent built quality, the glass top makes it very easy the clean in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, it is wildly inaccurate at the gram-scale, and unreliable at ounce-scale, and only useful for lbs/kgs.

0,"I've had these for over 2 months now any they work very well.  They are plastic so you need to use a little care when inserting the SSD.  I've putting SSDs in and out many times and have not had any issues. SSD must be pushed all the way in (sometimes you think it's in but misses by 1/8"".  When installing, be sure to tighten screws as tight as possible without breaking the plastic.  I find this much more reliable the pull open door types  that you push on the end to get SSD to release (I've broken 2 of the door type because pushing broke the plastic lever).

Amity. Erited. And one more which name I can't remember. Beatrice's test results are divergent. This is bad. On choosing day, both Beatrice and Caleb have to chose their fraction. Caleb chooses Erited, while Beatrice chooses Dauntless. Caleb go's with his new fraction. Beatrice go's with hers. She needs to jump on a train, then on a roof, then of into a net in a underground hole.

1,I would not stay at this hotel again. The rooms had a fowl odor. It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned. The neighborhood was also less than desirable.

0,"Herding dogs often love to push balls around with their noses, which helps satisfy their herding instinct if you don't have sheep. The ball needs to be too big for them to fit into their mouths, otherwise they might just pick it up instead of pushing it around, which isn't much fun.  Our Border Collie/ Australian Shepherd mix expends tons of energy running around pushing it all around the yard like crazy, frequently changing directions. Some days it is actually her primary form of exercise, she loves it so much.  It's a bit too big and hard for her to bite into, which is a good trait for a herding ball. Larger dogs could probably manage to bite into it."

0,"I love this hat. The styling is super cute, especially with the bow at the back. It seemed to fit about the same as most standard ladies hats of this type, possibly a little looser as I have a big head and tend to find most hats slightly small until they have been broken in and stretched. This fit well from the get-go. There is a slight amount of adjustability (there's a velcro closure by the bow on the back) but not much. The construction on it is solid and seems like it will hold up to a lot of wear - already been through the wash once after being thrown in a mud puddle and stepped on by my toddler, and it still looks good as new. I purchased the dark violet color - it's definitely not violet, more of a light tweedy brown - BUT it is the exact color that it shows on the computer screen. So ignore the words and go off of the picture :) Huge brim is great for the beach, reading, gardening, or just everyday wear to protect your face from the sun. Please note, the brim does NOT extend all the way around the back. It almost gives this hat more of a bonnet look than the oversized sun hats one often thinks of. I think this gives it more style, but if you're looking for something to also protect the back of your neck, this is not the hat for you. I love this hat and will be getting a lot of use out of it this summer!  I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

0,"On the plus side, this movie serves up the most beautiful images of Italy. In fact, Italy is the star here. And I completely enjoyed all of the Italian actors who played smaller roles.  It's a pleasant, likeable, feel-good movie, and if that seems like damning with faint praise, that's because it is..  Very much a chick flick, which is not a put-down.  (And when did movies about relationships, feelings, romance come to be something to sneer at, anyway? )  There are no wizards here, no space aliens, no explosions, no threats to the future of the planet.  No violence at all.  The actors are all fine and Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, superb.  One exception is Christopher Egan, whose performance for most of the movie is over the top, which may be less inept acting than poor direction.  That being said, here's the downside:  It's going to remind you of a lightweight, made-for-tv romance of the type you can find on the Lifetime or Hallmark channel, just with a bigger budget.  The intrusive candy-pop music selections can't help but point you in that direction and make you think that perhaps it's targeted to junior high schoolers. I found myself wondering how Vanessa Redgrave had wandered into a piece of fluff like this.  The plot has more potential than substance as presented here and with each new development it's easy to predict what will happen next.  No real drama, yet no comedy either.  In fact, no tension, no suspense, no surprises, no energy or sizzle.  Which is why the best I can say about it is that it's okay.  Just okay.  But I would have been angry had I spent $10 or $12 to see it in a theater.  If you want to see a 'chick flick' that emotionally touches you, inspires you to think, has more than a passing impact, then I suggest you consider The Enchanted April or Mona Lisa Smile or the marvelous German film, Mostly Martha (the original, not the American remake)."

0,"has gone downhill so much we almost checked out. We stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in Chicago. We've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula, it has always been a comfortable and clean, service oriented hotel. Not only has room service been eliminated (if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street, so is ONLY Italian), complimentary morning coffee is no longer available, mini bars have been removed from the rooms, etc. etc. The only restaurant, the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night, the bar also, so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests. Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations, but we weren't told of it. We also learned that the bell staff (who have been there for 13 and 8 years) is being eliminated. So, in other words, anyting to do with 'service' is gone from this hotel. I hear they are going to begin renovations in December, but that is no excuse to let an old glory 'go to pot' in the meantime. We won't be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving. We even had to pay for internet. Mind you, our bill for 3 nights was 900.00+, no room service, no restaurant/bar charges. Highway robbery for what you get ow at the Ambassador East. Sad."

0,"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).  It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.  Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying."

0,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.  Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper. By the end of the third book I had more than 100 bookmarks."

0,"Maybe I expected too much, but I was disappointed. It was set up so well to be an amazing movie. Acting for the most part was real and to the point. In the middle it just turned into a mi between ""How to promote your business with Twitter for complete beginners"" training video, and an episode of Restaurant Impossible. Jon Favreau went up a notch in my book, but entire movie was incomplete and too predictable. Ex-husband scenes were over the top and Sophia failed to convince as the ex. I SO WANTED THIS TO WORK! ARG! Enjoyable but failed to captivate. I was merely watching."

1,"I got his Women's Silicone Roller & I Love It. I also love that it's been used to make two different sizes of roller, both of which have different weights. The only thing that I do like about this roller is that it's a little thicker than my previous one. The texture of the roller is very soft and it's a little thicker than my previous roller. I also like that the roller has a handle that can be used to push the roller down when I'm not using it. I also like that the roller has a small, rubber ring that I can use to hold it in place and put it on. The roller also has a tiny, plastic sleeve that I can use to cover my face. I also like that the roller has a rubber liner that I can use to keep my face warm and dry. I also like that the roller is a little more flexible and helps prevent wrinkles. Overall I really like this roller and would recommend it to anyone. I bought this roller for my wife and she loves it."

1,"I was hesitant to read this book, as it seemed too preachy for my taste. I wasn't impressed. I liked the story and the characters, but it was boring. The author seemed to be trying to get the reader to love her characters. The writing style seemed a bit too choppy and choppy. There was a lot of dialogue and the story didn't quite get to the heart of it. It was like a well-written story that was written in a very short time. I liked the ending and it was nice to see a hero come back and save the world. The characters were too likable and the story was just too much like a story to me. I loved the ending and didn't like the ending at all. I don't know if I'd have read it again if I wasn't so absorbed in the story. I really did like the ending. I read the story for a week and it just did not seem worth it. I would recommend this to anyone. I've read all of the James Patterson books. I've enjoyed the first one a lot and loved the last one."

0,"This lamp is very basic. The warning label was designed for the older style incandescent light bulbs. That is out of date. The shade is too short to accommodate the longer twist fluorescent bulbs. The twist bulbs produce less heat than the older style incandescent light bulbs. A 60 watt maximum for incandescent light bulbs, which produced a dim yellow light and lots of heat, is too limited. The electric cord had a long ""flag"" label wrapped around it, with an admonition to not remove it. Ha! Right! I'm going to leave the stupid label to interfere with my using the electric cord, safely! Time to design a lamp for the modern bulb, fluorescent or LED. Otherwise, this lamp provides a convenient but basic light."
0,"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.  I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.  I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.  It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...  Please see my other review on Amazon of yoga and meditation dvds."

0,"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.  Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.  They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.  This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.  A highly recommended read.  Read and Reviewed voluntarily for Reading Is Our Satisfaction Blog  FIVE STARS."

When my dogs see these, they go crazy! One of the best ""bang for your buck"" options out there."

I can't believe I've read 8 of the 9 books plus the shorts and vignettes within a week's time. I'm a fast reader but this even surprises me. I highly recommend this series to everyone as it's filled with fun, some drama, some mystery and intrigue, but down right good small town living as it should be."

You can't go wrong in this series and the cliffy with this book had me wanting to jump through the screen...This is not a series you can predict in the very first few books this author keeps you hanging each and every time.  Get this series is all I have to say  Happy Reading"
0,"After much research (and waffling) I held my breath and ordered these bars along with the Sunlite Steel stem and was able to convert my craigslist 1986 Schwinn LeTour mixte to a fully upright riding position.  As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conversion that I cried.  Thank you other reviewers and bloggers...you gave me the courage to order the parts and the ability to finally sit completely upright.  My full review of the products together and process is on the Sunlite stem page...I don't want to bore with repetition.  I will say, the handlebars seem like very good quality to me.  I like the straight front which will accept a basket, and the grip part was long enough for my vintage Schwinn grips plus brake levers.  I have downtube shifters and, as others have noted, there is not enough room on the straight back portion to have grips, shifters, and brakes.  But it worked for me.  I did as another reviewer reported and angled the bars down a little, so my wrists are in their natural, straight alignment when on the grips.  Am loving the whole set up!  Thank you amazon and thank you reviewers!"

Even though our rate was so cheap, the service was wonderful, the front desk were polite& cheerful, the doormen and valet were great and helpful, and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on, free of charge! The fitness room was clean, large and provided fruit and clean towels, and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel. Location of hotel is safe, and such a beautiful area. Check the rates directly online of the hotel's website, as it was the least expensive. We will stay here again for sure."

0,"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy. The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces. Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there. These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.  I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?  But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far. I am hoping they make a 3.0 version with a  heavier base and no areas where kibble pieces can get stuck."
1,"I have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first. However when I arrived there was amazed at the location! It is near so many shopping places, museums, theatre, and many others places. Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long, however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day! The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel. All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room, good service, and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby, will be heading back to this hotel many times."

My room even had an internet connection! I also had dinner one night at the China Grill, and it was an amazing meal! Overall, I had a great stay, and will return next time I am in Chicago."

In our experience the horse walking worked well on smooth flooring and thin carpeting, but not (obviously IMHO) on thick carpeting.  Restarting the horse after it enters sleep mode is a little tedious (holding the button down until something happens) but better than the alternative of running the batteries down.  I can see some definite additional play possibilities if and when they start making more of these remote control horses, especially if they speed them up a bit and add unicorns so that they can be made to ram into each other.  (When I mentioned this to my 9-year-old daughter, she raised an eyebrow, folded her arms, and said, ""Daddy...."", then picked up the horse and stalked off.)  Maybe it's another one of those differences between boys and girls things.  Note: This play set is one way to (start) acquiring horses and dolls for the otherwise horseless and doll-less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-and-Her-Sisters-in-a-Pony-Tale-RV-Vehicle/dp/B00C6PV4QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale RV Vehicle</a>, another remarkable toy in this line."

You have to read the fine print.  I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.  Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens."

0,"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.  There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?  At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.  There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.  The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.  The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.  If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.  Was it perfect?  No, but it came close."

(In other words, it's not my feet that are different sizes.) All said, I am keeping them but won't be buying another pair in another color, as I had considered doing before trying them ... unless they become $15 less expensive, and then I'll deal with the size issue."
0,"Ahh, Kennedy even for a Dom he really was a sweetie! I'm sure he wouldn't like to be thought of as a sweetie, but his actions says otherwise.  Dar/Mackenzie, she was a strong businesswoman, with an independent mind, she knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go for it. Her visit to the Hub, although not her first was interesting, she definitely got more than she had bargained for.  I loved her group of friends, Bella was a good friend, as was Mackenzie in return.  Kennedy had a strong group of friends too; in Julien, Reece and Grant.  We already know Reece's story and I'm sure Grant and Julien's are going to be Fab.  Although they were together for Reece's bachelor party, they really had Kennedy's back.  As eccentric as Julien is, he helped Kennedy see sense and made him realize he had been a fool.  As did Bella with Mackenzie, I loved the interaction between Mackenzie and her neighbor and his dog, she has a really caring nature.  The sexy scenes were fab, and I needed to fan myself more than once, not to mention other forms of relief :) !  I felt that although the story ended on a very good positive note, it would be great to have seen how they got on with the moratorium they had agreed to.  Looking forward to finding out more about Julien or will it be Grant in the next book.  Love your work Sierra !"

1,I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago. I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again.
0,"""Into the Wilderness"" is great escapist reading. Though the beginning could be described as somewhat sedate, that is certainly not the word for the latter part of the novel. I found myself tightly gripping the book during more than one exciting scene, wide-eyed and breathless as the action unfolded. Great characters people the book,  the writing is terrific, the (...) scenes are tastefully done, and the adventure is a grand one. I love this book and look forward to reading the subsequent novels in the series. Highly recommended escapist fare."

0,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.  ""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.  Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.  ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept."

0,"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.  This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".  But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.  But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.  On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".  And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.  Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller."

The story is told from the perspective of a young girl who is facing a difficult life, and it is hard to be with a person who is young and strong. The characters are well developed, and the story is fast paced. I was able to keep up with the characters, and the story flowed well. I received a copy of this book for an honest review.

Unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, The Sofitel would surely have it. My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago, one would hardly want to leave. Fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave."

If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.  Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."

0,"Somewhat reminiscent of The Book of Lost and Found, by Lucy Foley, Cooking For Picasso weaves a tale rooted in the mother-daughter relationship, with mystery, heartbreak, and romance in lovely Mediterranean landscapes all blended together in an entertaining tale.  I liked the parallel structure of the book, switching back and forth in time from the modern-day part of the story in which the granddaughter, Cline, is dealing with her mothers poor health, her conniving half-siblings (characters who come up just short of comic-opera levels of villainy), and a search in the French Riviera town of Juan-les-Pins for a mysterious bequest from her grandmother Ondine.  The book is somewhat uneven in structure and execution, trying just a little too hard at times to sustain the edge and the mystery, casting one too many stumbling blocks in the way as Cline delves into her mothers and het grandmothers pasts, and delving a time or two into some quite frankly erotic scenes which, while not offensive were rather graphic, and a bit out of character with the rest of the book. All those things having been said, this book is a delightful read, over all, which has me pining for a Provenal vacation!"

1,"The author maintains that it is an academic work, which is a shame because it is a powerful and important work.  The book is both entertaining and informative.  It is very interesting to see what is happening in the world in which this is written.

0,I did receive these as a promotion and I really like these gloves. They protect my hands from heat with a pot I took right off the stove and tried them by holding it in my hand. Didn't feel any heat transfer. The silicon grips are great too as I don't feel that my hands are going to slip. Have used them multiple times and they do not transfer heat. I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus. I would probably like the longer cuff for taking pans out of an oven but it is not like these are short and I don't think I will burn myself but maybe if you are a bit clumsy you might? I would totally recommend them even if I was buying them.

I have used this product for about a year now, and it works great. I have had no adverse reactions to it. I will keep buying it. I have a cat who is obsessed with this food. This has given him a great amount of energy. It's very healthy for him and his digestive system. I would recommend this food to anyone who has a cat who likes to chew. I have a small dog and he likes it too. This is a very good dog food. I have three dogs, two of whom are tall, and one of them has had a few issues with it. It's very good for a small dog. I give it four stars because it is a little pricey but I will buy it again. My cats love this food. They love the taste and are getting used to it. My cat's favorite is that she eats it when she is eating. She will be eating it when she is done. I don't give it to her at all. I give it to her when she is at work or while she is on the couch. It is well made and it is very well made."

I really enjoyed the story and felt there was a lot of action in this one. I was a bit annoyed by both Taylor's and Lucas's reluctance to confide in each other and their ridiculous resistance to the marriage, but I do understand it was expected due to their backgrounds. I wish we'd been able to meet Lucas's brothers. There was a nice little mention of the Emerald and Black Harry from the Crown's Spies Series. Overall, very nice story."

0,"Unfortunately, this movie is not very good.  Such an epic moment in time truly deserves a good movie, and I was suckered into watching this on the grounds that I may have stumbled upon one.  Well, there was a reason why I'd never heard of this movie, that reason being: because this movie is really bad at being a movie.  It's EXTREMELY hackneyed and cliched, and doesn't make that okay by being fun to watch.  It's not bad because it's an anti-war movie or for any political reasons, it's bad because it's boring and poorly put together as a film.  Maybe someday they'll make a good movie about The Battle of the Somme, but as of 2016, that day hasn't come."
0,"This is a great courtroom drama, with detailed analysis of the characters involved. No character is a stereotype, with some approaching pure evil and others somewhat good, but all the characters are believable and their behavior consistent. Turk is very adept at providing just the right level of detail to convey his message. The story and its ending are groaningly realistic. The good guys don't always win, and evil sometimes prevails. Perverted and unusual sex are on display, but not graphic. The message is delivered in good taste, but still delivered. The courtroom action itself is spell-binding, and makes it impossible to break from reading. Give this book a read, you won't be disappointed."

The author explains the reasons why it is so difficult to stay in the West, how it came about, and how to move back home. It is a great read, and I recommend it highly. I was so happy to see the first book in this series! I love the characters and their story line! It's very refreshing to see the characters in action again. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great read. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next one. This book is a must read for all of us. I couldn't put it down. I have to say I had a hard time putting it down. It was a story that I was deeply interested in. I love the characters and the story line. I thought this was a great book to read.

0,"DFW deserves a better biographer ... this book reads like a very long Wikipedia article.  I applaud Max for doing original research (interviews, etc.) and roughly half of the information in this book was new to me, but I feel like he should have spent way more time actually WRITING a biography rather than collating a bunch of letters and interviews without really analyzing his subject.  I never get the sense that the author is anything more than a mediocre journalist, or a member of a particularly active DFW list-serv who decided that he wanted to write a book---except that he didn't actually know anything about writing biographies."

0,"I've owned this wireless mouse for 3 years now, and it worked wonderfully for the first year and a half. This is a good wireless mouse for your notebook. It is small and easy to stuff into a pocket. I like the feel of this mouse; it fits snug in my hand, and doesn't feel cheaply made. The battery life is about 1-2 months if used daily. The scroll, I think, is the best part of this mouse. The quality of the scroll is good, and coherent with your actions. The reason i'm giving this a 3 stars is because the signal of the mouse got much worse over time. I was be able to use this 10 feet away without a problem when it was new, but after a while, it became choppy and would disconnect even if I were a few inches away. All in all, this is a good, cheap wireless mouse that is acceptable while it lasts."

0,"In a world of Elena's, Sookie's, Bella's and Buffy's it is refreshing to have a somewhat campy novel about vampires that isn't all blood and lust.  Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.  This story really reminds me of the early Queen Betsy books - you know the GOOD ones - and is a funny yet engaging tale that kept me entertained the entire read.  I really hope that this turns into a series as Queen Betsy should just be staked already and I'm looking for a new fun series to take its place."

0,"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it."

1,"Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. At first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. To make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. This was simply unacceptable by any standard."

I wanted a 2 point belt vs 1 point for the stability and this patrol belt works great!  Took me a few minutes to figure out how it worked... there were battle clips and quick length adjustments that I wasn't familiar with at first. Once I got it dialed in, it's rock solid and very easy to adjust on the fly! The bungee cord section works great at buffering the weight of my 8lb rifle on the run.  Last thing, I found/bought this sling from the Amazon Warehouse as an used item for $14! Out of the box, it was pretty much brand new with no signs of ware! Their description of ""good to excellent"" condition was right on."

0,"This was a beautifully crafted movie, gritty, suspenseful, well written and wonderfully acted. It told a nice detective yarn with real characters, well developed characters. There was enough grime and blood to be titillating but not in my opinion over the top. The pacing was just right; It flowed beautifully right down to the wonderfully done pull at the close of the last scene. It was almost really good. But the script pulled me out of it too many times. The dialog occasionally felt like it had been pulled right out of a novel without nearly enough of the back story you would find in the novel to justify it. I imagine it would feel okay to someone who had read the novel but in the movie it was sometimes insufficient to suspend belief. That being said I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. I would watch another with this character."

0,"Judy Holiday won an Oscar for this film, and no wonder: her performance of Billie Dawn, a ""dumb broad"" who suddenly wises up in a most unexpected way, is certainly one of the finest and most original film performances in 20th Century American cinema. The story, from the stage success, concerns a crass junk yard tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who goes to Washington to buy a Senator--and promptly considers that his blonde-bimbo mistress Billie Dawn (Holiday) lacks enough poise for such refined circles.  He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to ""smarten her up.""  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light. The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.  The film very neatly balances its comic elements with its serious side, and neither predominate nor throw the film off center; director Cukor steers a perfect course.  A must-see and a must-own."

0,"That's a ""you go girl"" both for the super spunky heroine who doesn't want to wait for a knight in shinning armor to save her, but instead is ready to solve the mystery herself and live for herself instead of following conventions, and for the author Anne Osterlund, who took on the big task of writing a first book and turned out a fun read (also because I sort of knew her when we were little, so I'm impressed that a small town girl has done big things!).  I really enjoyed this story.  Even though some of the events in the plot may seem familiar to those who like romance/fantasy, Anne did a good job creating a fresh take on those events with her original heroine.  I'm hoping for a sequel maybe, and look forward to reading more by this author!"

I'm uncertain if it was caused by the demand from FSX but I do know something was notably wrong. To be fair, I may just have received a faulty piece of hardware. Nonetheless, after the third nose-dive; out it came. I didn't care about warranties at that point and I am thankful that my OS was not on it. Sadly, it was the worst hard drive that I ever had.

Other than that, it's a nice little drive.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this drive.  It's a solid drive, and it's solid.

They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often. They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do!

0,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."

0,"This was a gentle, romantic Western. The main story includes two couples, one younger and one slightly older. The older couple have known each other for a while and their relationship develops into love. The young couple meet at the beginning of the book and slowly get to know each other and then fall in love. Each relationship must deal with the fact that the men believe in spanking their woman for any misbehaviour. There is also a great mystery that's weaved throughout the book. It's a very believable story and another winner from Misty Malone!"
0,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.  Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.  Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon."

0,"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about Saba and her journey to recover her twin brother, Lugh, after he is kidnapped from their home at Silverlake.  Saba is very close with her twin brother and puts him on a pedestal...he is the light to her dark.  When the reader first encounters Lugh, he is a father-like figure, taking care of the day-to-day needs of Saba, their father, and their younger sister, Emmi.  Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.  Along the way, she also meets Jack and a gang of revolutionary girls called the Free Hawks.  We watch how she grows as a person and learns the importance of family and friends.  I highly recommend."

I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me. i told them to cancel the room. based on the reservation experience, I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel."
0,"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro. Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)  Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG. I did receive a complimentary unit for an unbiased review, but honestly they would have been my first choice for purchase anyway. They have a loyal customer in me though I would be sure to let you know if they dropped the ball in any way with their products."

0,"I bought this for my 18 mo old granddaughter along with a Melissa and Doug Jenna doll.  I took one star off because the bedding is pretty thin and chintzy.  But that was okay because I wanted to make my own bedding for it anyway.  Wish I would've taken a pic.  Turned out really cute with little quilts, sheets and pillows.  Bed is quite sturdy though and great size for the M&D Jenna doll.  Very happy with it."

1,Best purchase I've made this year!
1,"it fits 3/8"" and comes with an easy to carry pouch.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the design.  The ring is not solid, it's a bit bent and it's not clear how it will bend.  This is a problem for most people and a problem for others.  I also don't think the ring is a solid enough ring.  I would buy another ring to replace it if I needed one.  The price was great for this item.  You can buy it for $100 and it will last you a long time.  The price is a good price for what it is.  I'm not a big fan of the price and I don't"
0,"I mostly liked this book and read it quickly. Hoever I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It left too many questions unanswered and some things just didn't make sense. For example, why was Truscott always following Alex and how did he get all of hs inside information? How could Truscott and Michael Bell know that Alex went to Vermont? How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen. Why wouldn't Alex have heard the shot when Michael Bell killed Truscott. So, basically I liked the book a lot but the ending was a big let down."

0,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.  Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.  The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.  When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.  The price of these shoes was outstanding!"

Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters.  Perhaps in my top 3 of Burrough's books."

Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in, we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention, she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault. Needless to say I will not be staying here again."

0,"This Next-shine digital scale is super cute!!! I have wanted to have a smaller scale around the house for some time now.. For mailing things out, weighing food ect. I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.  I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.  I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.  * I received this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.

0,"This is the nutritionally best guinea pig food commercially available (IMHO).  I've done a lot of research over the 20+ years I've been a guinea pig pet-parent and I run a guinea pig enthusiast and informational site.  This is my #1 recommended pelleted food.  I live in a very rural area where guinea pigs as pets are pretty much unheard of so finding a small animal vet for my babies was difficult and we have to drive about 30min to get there.  The vet and one of his technicians are the only people in the county who have taken a 'pig for a checkup and imagine my delight to find out they use and recommend the brand I was already using: Oxbow.  I used this brand for my rabbit who lived a healthy 10 years. Please remember to protect the vitamin content by storing in a dark container in a cool environment.  Sunlight deteriorates the Vit. C which important for 'pig health."

1,"As other reviewers have stated, the light does not emit a visible amount of light. This is a very small light and I am not going to have to use the flashlight in my work area. It is not waterproof so it will be very difficult to see through. The light is a bit too small to be used in a confined space and it is not so bright that it is distracting. The light is bright enough to see through some objects that are very small. The light is bright enough to see through small objects that are very small. I am not a professional or expert and am not sure that it is a good light. However, I am very pleased with this light and would recommend it to anyone. I would also like to say that it is a very solid product and the color rendition is excellent. I would recommend this light to anyone. I really like these. They are very bright and the colors are pretty good. I bought a couple of and they work great. I have a number of other lights that I would recommend to anyone who needs more light. They are a bit dimmer than these and I can't see much in the way of light at night. I like the way these dimmers are designed. I like that they have a solar panel so that I can use it with my other lights. I really like that they are not so large that I cannot see in the way of light. The only downside is that they are so small that they are very hard to hold up to the elements."

I was so excited when I saw this, it's just so charming and fun for kids.  There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.  I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."

0,"I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels, but this place is awful !!! I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more 'botique' . The carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! The bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. We told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. The elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. I did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. What a disappointment :("

I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.  I'd recommend this, I've used it a couple times now without issue.  There is an on/off switch too which should help with the battery."

0,"It is very, very small. It's a great concept, but it does not work for large, active dogs. The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed. Some people suggested that you can leave the tags attached to the O-ring and just slip them in the pouch, but still, you run the risk of the pouch ripping away. I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.  Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom. My husband suggested I put the tags on a carabiner and then unclip it from her at night and when she is in the house so we don't have to listen to them jangle. Then I can just clip the carabiner back on her when she goes outside."

This is ridicoulus.The iPod dock in the room didn't work. Also, we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over. Definitely is not value for your money.

0,"I don't know how I missed this story and this author. I think it has something to do with Amazon's awful search results of books when searching for a specific genre. However, I did come upon this wonderful gem accidentally and I could not be happier. I have read both books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Can not wait for the third book in this series. Great characters, great chemistry between the H/h, excellent plots and twists. You won't be disappointed. My personal beef with books in this genre, is when the heroines are redundantly stupid and frustrating throughout the story. If you can get past that, you will definitely enjoy this series. I read it with my Kindle Unlimited subscription, but went back to purchase both books. Hopefully book three will be out soon. Great BWWM story you won't want to miss."

Each little bug has this super happy smile on its face, they're all really soft and each one has some nice feature, like wings that crinkle or a rattle inside. My son (6 mos) likes the spider best because he can get a really good grip on the legs and then try to cram the entire thing into his mouth (not possible). The jar is cute, all the bugs come in and out very easily. it's a good toy but sheesh, if you're thinking of buying this for your own kid, save your money and get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hasbro-Playskool-Let-s-Play-Together-Fill-N-Spill-Fish/dp/B000FKNQHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hasbro Playskool Let's Play Together Fill 'N Spill Fish</a>&nbsp;(we've got that too, sans the red fishie because we took it to the mall with us and lost it), it's cheaper, just as cute, and is essentially the same thing.

The handle seems sturdier than others coupled with being a little longer.  The wheels are fine, I didn't want a ""spinner"" briefcase, but I was willing to let that go because of its other assets.  It seems some people have many more problems with wheels on luggage than I, so I must not test their durability enough to proclaim these ""sturdy"". They seem fine.  The quality of the outside material is a heavy nylon type, not something that would rip easily.  The laptop protector incorporated in the case is easily adjustable and accomodates my Dell E6510(17"") easily.

Despite having paid for Priceline, I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend, instead. I didn't regret it for a second. You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more. The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive. There are enough hotels near the loop (and near a train/bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively) that you should not spend the money on the Millenium. Do not waste your time and stay here--this is a trap because of its location, but it's not worth it. Really."

0,"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.  I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?  I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last."
0,It is not twistable after being in the freezer. I always have to put it under tap water for a while before I can twist it. Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 or more containers to fit a normal size bunch of parsley.

1,"Whenever I decided to stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park, the only thing that I had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband. However, the hotel choice wasn't the best. Right in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation. The room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room, which was much smaller than the original one. The hotel did give us a discount, but if I'd paid for the large room was because I wanted the it. A hotel with this name shouldn't put its guests in these kind of situation. I wont be reserving room there again."
0,"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.  I hope Vantec will see this review for the next design model."

This book is definitely a must read for any person interested in the life of a detective.I really enjoyed this book.  I love a good mystery with a good twist.  I have read a lot of her books and she has always made me laugh and cry.  The only reason I gave this one a five star rating was that I felt it was not as good as some of her other books.  I read a lot of her other books and this one was just a tad too sad.  It is a fun mystery and I would definitely recommend it to any fan of mystery or mystery writers.I've read all of the 3 books by this author.  I have no idea how to describe them.  I don't really know how to put them all together.  I know that this is a short book, but I think that it will be worth the time.  I love how it is written.  I have read all 3 books by this author.

The gimmick is very visible and identifiable.  Also, if you have big hands like I do, let's just say this trick is not for you.  It's made for people with small hands.

I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.  Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.  Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.  Five stars."

My cats are not very picky about treats, and it's not just the treats that are good for them. They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around. It does not look too small, but it does not have the same amount of room to move around. I have a 5 pound dog and she is a senior dog. She is a big chewer so it is difficult to get her to move around, but it is a nice size for her."

0,"Overall, I enjoyed the story. Some of the details/actions were not consistent with the time period. Also, while I think flawed characters make for much better stories, there are better ways to write in the ""flaws"" than having an antagonist point them out at every opportunity. Also, the attempt at romantic tension between the heorine and the male character grated on my nerves. The male character was presented, first to last, as an insufferrable jerk, though the implication was that he's really just misunderstood. He's being an ass to push her away because he really wants to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx....  SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future books by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery readers turning pages. Just, please, drop the annoying romance sterotypes, there are better ways to develop intimacy, meaningful and realistic connections, between characters. (A little more research on the crime element of the time period might help too)."

0,"What a great book.... Read in a few hours, I nearly forgot to eat!!! Read this book, the plot and premise is different and I enjoyed the suspense and not being able to guess what would happen... I always love a heroine that is strong and vulnerably honest at the same time. Shadow, the ultimate hot, broody, bad boy who is broken....I am however a bit of a Lincoln fan, will be interesting to see his character evolve more.  The love between shadow and aria did seem to be a little clichd and all too fast but all is revealed in the cliffhanger ending. Which was totally unexpected, I loved it....When is book 2 out????"
0,"I like the durability of these, I am not sold on their oblong size. I bought these because I was under the impression that they fit in spice jars. They don't fit as well as I'd hoped. You need to do some manipulating which causes some of the measurement to fall out."
0,"If you need a basic no frills stereo receiver, this is the way to go.  As a bonus it has a phono input for a turntable.  The Sherwood sounds at least as good as my Sony STR-DG720 in stereo mode and is probably more powerful.  I use this receiver with an HDTV, cd changer, and turntable.  I purchased a second Sherwood RX-4109 for about $90 with tax from electronics expo a couple of months ago.  I notice a very quiet hum from the speakers when the receiver is powered up and no signal is sent.  Once I press play on the CD player the hum disappears and can only be heard at extreme low volume.  It does not bother me as this is not my primary listening system.  The first receiver from Sherwood I purchased probably does the same thing, I just newer noticed.  Does not change my opinion of the product because of the price, power, and excellent am/fm tuner."

0,"The factory ""calibration"" differs dramatically on these. I got two and both display very different colors. Even with adjustment, they are still different. Maybe it is the backlight on one of them. Nice thin bezel. 100mm VESA mount. Got both mine for 119 and 6 months apart. Don't overpay. No ghosting.  Cons - Wiggles when hit. the two I got are at different heights (off by .5mm). I just put some folded paper to raise one. One of them shipped without the screw to attach the base. I just used one I had laying around instead. The led flashed at night VERY BRIGHTLY if the monitors are on. I covered up the LEDs with two layers of duct tape. This is inconspicuous if done properly and helps with the light. Stand is a little big, but not too noticeable."

0,"This hotel is totally overrated. Yes, the location is awesome, but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. The customer service, or lack thereof, was particularly disappointing. Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full. The housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day. Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway. As stated previously, the location is great. Location, however, does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff. I would not stay here again."

0,This was adorable and not very hard to apply.  I can't give it five stars because I've bought other wall decals where the application and removal was super easy.  This was a little more difficult because you have to pull off one layer and stick it on the wall in the perfect location the first time or else you're in trouble.  Because this is a small wall decal it was pretty easy.  I recommend this for anyone with a weirdly placed bathroom that people often mistake for a closet =)

0,"These are great for a 4 year old who likes to build!  The packaging is a little disappointing, as it is a cardboard box with a plastic cover.  This does not create the type of seal I would prefer for a toy with many small parts.  The pieces themselves are occasionally tough for a child to fit together snugly.  The choices in this set are fun and clearly created for a girl, and they have instructions on how to create several options in the box that are easy to follow. Overall this is a solid set if you have a girl who likes building and who enjoys pretend play, as it allows you to create a princess and some animal friends to play within the built structures."
0,"The story: Betrayed by her new husband, lovely Scottish bride Iolanthe MacLeod dies by the sword in the fall of 1382 in a landlocked keep on the English moors, far from the sea she loves. She gives up on her dreams of a man coming to rescue her and spends the next 600 years haunting the castle were she was killed. However, when Thomas McKinnon arrives to see the castle he purchased in 2001, she  recognizes him as the man from her dreams. At first all Thomas wants to do is restore his crumbling old castle, but he finds himself falling in love with a ghost. Now all he has to do is find a way for Iolanthe to become a permanent part of his world.   This is my first book to read by Lynn Kurland, and to be fair, it would have been better if I had read her other books first. She has a whole series on the MacLeods/MacKinnons/De Piagets. However, I do think that books in a series should be able to stand on their own and this falls a little short. There are too many back stories that need to be explained, and a lot of loose ends that are not tied (presumably these will be explained in later books).   This story does invovle time travel, and ghosts, so it requires a lot of imagination on the reader's part. The relationship between Thomas and the ghost inhabitants of the castle is quite funny and some of the supporting characters are quite likable. I loved the part where Iolanthe uses Thomas's computer to teach the garrison how to read. The part of the story where Thomas rescue's Iolanthe is also quite exciting and romantic. There are no love scenes in this book, only a few kisses and embraces. There is some violence and descritpions of battle scenes. If you like books in a series, I would recommend this book, but if not, then you may want to skip this one. JBogue paper-and-lace Specializing in paranormal romance and fiction"

0,"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try."

1,"I stayed at the Knickerbocker Hotel the last time I visited Chicago. I lived in Illinois during college, and as I was on a college budget, most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. For my visit back, I decided I would treat myself to a nicer stay than I was used to, so I booked a room at the Knickerbocker. Everything looked nice when I got there, but for the price I paid, I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got. Maybe I wasn't dressed right, or didn't carry the right luggage, but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in. Shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college, the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out, and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. Here, I didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and 'too important to be bothered' attitude I got when I checked in. I guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit, but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. Look, obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel, I already booked and paid for the room. Even if customer service isn't your number one goal, making money should be pretty high up on the list, and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business. I doubt I'll stay here again."

0,"I've used Krylon paint with great results before. However, this paint is not up to par. Firstly, I seem to have gotten a bad can. When I first removed the lid, I found it had already spurted out some paint (likely during shipping). I made sure the spray tip was clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coats and two days of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuffs with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint. This is a primer/paint combo, but I still prepped my surface with a good sanding and cleaning. This paint just doesn't have the quality I have come to expect from Krylon."

0,"I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September, and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle, but affected me and my husband. For example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. The keycard just would stop working. Then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. It happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and I called on the hallway phone to get help. Luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. I said no, and she called down to check. Apparently, no one had even called Security to get me back into my room! She had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. Then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. It was a little after 10:30pm. We were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about '24 hour dining.' That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service. I don't think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again. BTW, the spa is great to hang out in, even if you're not doing a massage."

0,"STYLE: Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.  It doesn't have any nylon patches or extra zippered pockets like many others.  The design is clearly more function than fashion, but the overall cut of the jacket is relatively slim.  FIT: I bought this to wear as a second layer under my overcoat and to wear around the office when it gets cold, instead of a cardigan.  I am a shirt size 15.5 32/33 and the medium is a good fit, though it would probably be too tight over a heavy sweatshirt or sweater.  QUALITY: Quality is perfect.  No issues with any zippers or seams.  OVERALL: For the price, this is an excellent product.  I wear it every day and am giving it five stars.  However, if you are looking for something that will make a fashion statement, then I suggest you look elsewhere."

The cast was perfect and kept largely to the novel.  Lana Turner, Donna Reed, Edmund Gwen were perfect in their roles.  For its time this movie was far ahead with the special effects and photography.  I recommend this film to those who still believe of the courage of youth and the joy of reconciliation as older people.  I just can't recommend this film enough."
0,"It is official: vampires are so last year. Kate's Fallen helps lead the way in this new angelic revolution. Novels such as Fallen will easily do for angels what the Twilight series did for vampires.  Fallen was almost exactly what I was hoping it would be. It was dark, romance, and had tons of unexpected plot twists that had me gasping. While there is some room for improvement with the pacing of the novel, the overall premise was amazingly creative. It features a wonderful blend of religious ideals with Kate's fictitious world. Kate has a wonderful way of pulling the reader into the world of Sword & Cross. I constantly found myself thinking I had only read about five pages, only to discover it was closer to twenty. This is due in part to how well Kate explores the world she has created. Every detail has been thought of, and is explained beautifully.  But by far, my favorite aspect has to be the characters. Luce is an interesting heroine. I am really interested to see how she develops since there is a lot of potential with her. And I can't wait to see more of her and Daniel. They are an interesting pair to say the least. While I love those two, it is Cam that really has my attention. He is an alluring mixture of good and evil. I am dying to learn more about him, and his overall role in the plot. In regards to secondary characters, Kate has created some of my favorites of all time, with Penn leading the way. They are funny, creative, and above all else, memorable.  Despite certain plot issues that need to be addresses, I have to say that I am pleased with this novel. It was highly creative, and left me wanting to know me. I can't wait to see what twists await me in the next book."

I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.  Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.  Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.  I cannot wait till the next one comes out if their is a next one that is. I enjoyed getting to know these two couples and hope to read more about them in the future."

0,"I am probably not the most qualified person on Amazon to write a review on headphones/ear buds, but with that said, I LOVE THESE! Since my children are kleptomaniacs regarding anything electronic that Mom has, I only buy the super cheap headphones - the ones available at the gas station, costing $1-2. This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these. (Most of the earphones I've had made Johnny Cash sound like Axl Rose. ) I am truly surprised at how clear these make music sound and how well I can actually understand podcasts and comedy now. It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise. You absolutely cannot go wrong with these - and their low price just elevates them to perfection."

0,"I was a tiny tot--like one of Don Draper's kids, at the time of the events depicted in this season, and this series makes me feel I can make windows into my parents' world, even into their souls.  Dick Whitman's transformation into Don Draper is a brilliant trope, which operates both on the level of metaphor and plot, & is key to characterization.  Even if Dick Whitman had never switched dog tags with his dead commanding officer in Korea, he would have done everything possible to reinvent himself--and obliterate his past.  His ambition drives him into a brave new world in which he, rather like a master spy, must be the bravest.  The new name and social security number make this much more real & palpable, while generating practical complications which fuel the plot and allow us tantalizingly brief glimpses of the bleak world which drove him to his desperate deception.  Poignantly, he hands his half brother $5,000, a large sum in the early 1960's, to, as Dick/Don puts it, ""make a new life for yourself,"" to be another ""Don Draper,"" and vanish from Don's world.  But his brother misses the mark.  For mysterious reasons, he hangs himself.  In doing so, the half-brother's feeble surrender to fate becomes not only a foil for Don's strength, and the boldness of his social/psychological imagination, but an index of the ruthlessness with which he is prepared to ""murder his past.""  Looking at this series from the outside, the sets, costumes, automobiles, & etc., are every bit as authentic as other celebrated period dramas like Downton Abbey.  And in the the social realm, the casual racism, sexism, and class consciousness is perfect down to every dowdy pleat in Peggy Olson's skirt, every limp lock of hair in her bangs, every note of assumed superiority in Peter Campbell's prep school accent.  It's all here, a gripping sixties soap opera that will startle you, amaze you, melt your heart--and freeze it, keep you guessing--and hooked!"

0,"I don't prefer any of the stand-alone variations to the original Carcassonne and its expansions, but Gold Rush is definitely my favorite of them.  Compared with the original: -Railroads score similarly to roads (score double if only one tile has a locomotive) -Farmers score based on native villages (2 points each) and horse riders (4 points each) in the field -Mountains score the number of gold nuggets showing on the tiles -A City tile scores 3 points for each complete connected railway -At game's end, acquired mining tokens are revealed, gold is tallied and added to the final score  Gold Rush is challenging in a couple of ways. You only get 4 meeples, so throwing out that farmer too early will limit your options more than in the original game.  Placing one on a city tile is also risky, because you don't get it back until all connecting railroads are completed.  Also, other players can place a tent into a mountain your worker is attempting to mine, and they can mine it too (with some limitations). When you score the mountain you get all unclaimed tokens, but unless you did it quickly, there might not be any left to claim.  I don't much like the surprise victory points from the mining tokens at the end. It would be more strategic to know the value of what you have acquired as the game progresses, but that's a minor thing.  I really like the economy of decisions, in which you can choose not to place a worker, and instead take a mining token from a mountain you have claimed, or move your tent to a different tile within a mountain that contains more mining tokens.  The direct competition for mining tokens is a nice change of pace for me, but others might not like this aspect.  Overall, I think there's a slightly elevated tension in this variation of what is usually a pretty casual game, and I really enjoy it."

0,"I travel to chicago quite often, and have stayed at a bunch of hotels. I stayed at Conrad a couple of times. My impression was not too good. Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didn't feel welcome at all. The room was noisy. Thin walls, and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about. One time the tv was broken too, and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it... Anyway, given that this is a 4.5 star hotel, it really didnt live up to my expectations. After the 1st time at this hotel, I thought I might give it a second try. After the 2nd time, I decided I am really not coming back, especially given that there are so many other hotels close by.

Even before my visit, concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see, and booked tickets in advance to Second City.

The hotel is next to City Hall, where I had some business. We had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. Enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty. And that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish, if you want attentive service, this is the place to be. Thank you, Hotel Allegro, for a great stay. I can't wait to return."

0,"Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago, The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel 'needs updating,' but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.) There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars, that the Fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. See my profile for better ideas. Niftyc"

0,"FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.  And as everyone has already stated, this film is in widesreen and looks mighty sweet.  NO COMPLAINTS.  I can't give this set 5 stars because I think FEAR is not worthy.  BUt if you can find this cheaper than the stated price, maybe $10 or so, then you're taking about a 5 star purchase."
0,"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.  This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.  The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it.

0,"So, caveat of course - I did stop 1/3 of the way through the book, so it may well redeem itself later and come to a thrilling conclusion. I don't know, because I couldn't make it that far. Also, I think I missed one or more of the earlier books in this series. It seems like that might have been a prerequisite for liking the characters in this one, because none of them appealed to me. Mels, the heroine, was the most likeable but she still didn't grab me; she's stuck in a town she doesn't like and living with her mom and isn't doing anything about it. She's ""daring"" in that she doesn't wear a seatbelt, and nice in that she pays her debts and helps strangers in need, but that's about it. She's not striving for anything and has no greater plan of her own.  The hero and other male characters are all very JRWard-esque strong and uber-male and urban/gangsta, but not in a sexy way and again none of them really grabbed me. I wasn't rooting for anyone and wasn't worried about anyone. Unlike her Black Dagger Brotherhood series where the team is all about saving a community and innocents, in this series the cause (a fight between angels and demons) seems pretty self-centered. There may be some innocent caught in Hell that one of the angels is trying to rescue (again, must have missed that backstory in another book) but overall it seems the protagonists and antagonists are just trying to win a contest set up by the Maker in order to save their own souls.  Anyway - maybe if you read all the books in the series in order, and don't have any expectation of a good romance or quickly paced action, you'd enjoy it. I'll be skipping the rest of this series and waiting for her next."

The free program Burr Tools can let you explore more.  The puzzles in Doodle Fit use ""fixed"" polyominoes, which cannot be rotated.  This helps the enjoyability of these puzzles, since logic will often force a few of the pieces, and then the rest can be placed.  In each puzzle, a goal is given, and pieces that can make the goal.

I also ordered the traditional fit and it's lil more flush against the finger since it lays flat compared to the comfort fit. Comfort fit is rounded and sticks up from the finger slightly more. This ring is true to size but traditional fit runs 1/2 size smaller. Comfort fit is the way to go... The ring glides on/off like butter. Also 3mm is just right... Not too gaudy but wide enough to take notice. Love it!  Update 12/2015: I was able to go to Benchmark ring website and register my ring even though purchased from Amazon. Be sure to email Benchmark and ask about the registering your ring for their Lifetime Guarantee program. They have excellent customer service rep!  Update 5/2016: I am happy to report, after wearing the ring 6+ month nonstop, it is holding up nicely! Still shiny and polished.

Until I realized that the story was actually shorter than I thought, I couldn't put the book down, but I finally did because it was the early morning hours and I knew I could finish it off in the morning. Patrick, our hero, could be every girl's dream, and Cat is your smart-mouthed, spunky best-friend. I think this could be the perfect book to read at the beach or by the pool.

When Laila and her boyfriend Daniel go out for dinner at the restaurant of an old friend of Daniel's, they do not get to finish their meal. Hearing screams from the kitchen, Laila and Daniel rush into the kitchen to find a dead and frozen Santa in the walk in freezer. When his friend is suspected of the deed, Daniel asks Laila to help clear him. Daniel heads off to his family's home for Christmas and leaves Laila to work with the local police to find the culprit. I found the mystery interesting but the rest of the story was hard to take. First, the police were far to generous with sharing information with the amateur sleuth, second the sleezy behaviour of the friend left a bad taste in my mouth and was just left with no resolution and third, the murderer wanted to kill Laila, but all he does is tell her to give up her snooping?

0,"Best machine for the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three or four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!  It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five or six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and remove the grinder for a more thorough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months or so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes for the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!  I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.  I can't recommend this machine enough for coffee lovers. It makes the best espresso shots anywhere (we love Lavazza espresso http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Super-Espresso-Coffee-2-2-Pound/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1419869268&sr=1-2&keywords=lavazza+expresso), is easy to use and clean, and is a fabulous value.

0,"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.  When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.  EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""  ""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.  Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.  Beth Bradley.  Liar. Sinner. John. ""  There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.  This book is written in the 3rd person with both heroine and hero perspectives, it's unequal--there's more heroine than hero. I'd rate the steam at PG-13. There's a few scenes, but they aren't very explicit."

1,"I stayed this hotel for 2 nights. I had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures I've seen. Upon entering the building, you can easily see that it is clean and high class. The lobby was nice, and everything seemed as it should be. However, as soon as I made it into my room, it was completely different than everything previous to it. It was dirty, visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. The room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms I've been to. There was also a lingering smell from the last tenants. When I called the front desk about these issues, they sent someone up to fix it. I left the hotel about two hours and upon returning, they were still at it! This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors. The smell also did not completely disappear when they were done. As I was too tired, I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead. I hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me."

0,"We have been looking FOREVER it feels like for a good, durable outdoor table that will store away. It is great for kids. DEFINITELY will not hold the weight of an adult though, which was a little disappointing... we had our sons birthday party and he wanted me to sit with him and it about broke before I even put all my weight on it and I'm only 130. I don't think it would honestly hold more than 4 kids unless some sat on the joints. It held fine when my son (40lbs) sat on one bench but when his friend sat next to him (30 lbs) it began to creak and bend. The table top itself is a lot more sturdy. Our dog (60lbs) likes to lay on the table with our puppy (50lbs) and no bending or anything. Overall good buy, a little bit of a pain to put together but worth it for the safety factor."

It was like going back into my childhood, and I found this show is timeless.  You can be a kid and love it and you can be an adult and still laugh at Maxwell Smart's crazy antics.  The catchphrases you can't help but imitate and laugh at like ""Sorry About That Chief"", ""Missed It By That Much, And Loving It, and of course Would You Believe. This collection is a must buy for any Get Smart or Don Adams fan."

0,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better."

0,"Should have watched the video posted with the still pics for this toy.  In the pics, especially where the boy is kneeling, there is no background.  Because of this you can't tell that the toy MUST be attached to a wall to work.  See those yellow brackets (one is mid-circle on the right)?  The set comes with sticky pads that go on the backs of these yellow brackets, to attach them to the wall.  My son doesn't have enough open wall space in his room to use this.  Had to send it back.  But, I'm GLAD there was not enough wall space.  After watching the videos, the power boost, or whatever it's called, just makes the car go around and around.  NO interaction by the kids playing!  They just sit there and watch.  Check out one reviewers video for a quick experience of this toy.  The car goes around so fast you can't even see it!  Not the kind of Hot Wheel experience I want for my son.  Also, one reviewer said it was difficult to set up.  Not sure you'd WANT to break it down due when the child is done playing with it due to the difficulty factor AND due to the fact that it's stuck to the wall.  I prefer toys that you can put away after the child is done using it."

1,My husband was pretty happy with it and thought it would be a nice addition to his bike collection. I had to replace the crank with the H-frame to get it to work properly.

He said it's very lightweight and his bike is very easy to mount. The handlebar is a nice touch. I think it's a good addition to his bike collection. I would recommend it to anyone.

I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)  Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?   Review by: Kristy Dean  11/2014"

0,"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.  This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.  My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past."

I enjoyed reading it especially George (Lord Elmer's) antics.  I like how the author laces humor in this genre and manages to explain the difference between true love and infatuation.  Celine/Amy has her head over the clouds blinded by love when she loved those hideous poems. When she and George fought both of them made sense and I liked how they improved for each other.  Of all the places a duchess could give birth to, only Penelope could pull it off. Both Celine/Amy and George had brushes with danger and they always manage to get out unscathed.  I'd highly recommend this novel to those of you looking for a fun and light reading. Some scenes were hilarious I literally laughed out loud. More power Ms Wylde!"
0,"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.  Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.  Would I recommend this cage?  Yes, I may even buy another one for ""cat tree"" use myself if they bring the white one back into stock -- cages in the livingroom are not exactly ""high design"" -- I'd like them to at least match."
0,"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such. I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper. How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change. Is it odor or something else that is distressing him? 40+ yrs as a cat owner and veterinary professional has me looking at all issues. Please no comments in cat litter box behavior...I've spent my life helping others. I just wonder if he hates this whole contraption as much as I do? It has not made litter disposal simpler, easier, cleaner or cheaper."

0,"I bought this unit a couple years ago, and it is great. I use it often (mostly streaming or playing off my phone or laptop). When plugged in to the AC adapter, it is plenty loud. I use it to play songs I practice my bass to, and it's loud enough to keep up with a Hartke stack. I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though."

1,"The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower, while seemingly a good idea in theory, has many drawbacks. At first glance, it appears quite luxurious and grand, but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked. The hotel is quite tall, coming in at 32 stories, and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. The staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest, so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. The hotel tries to adopt a French flavor, but its efforts fall short. The only real French influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. The same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. The city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. Make a different choice."
0,"We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.  This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate. (1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it. (2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet. (3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in. (4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs). (5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.  (Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one."

1,I've read a lot of books by the author and this one is by far my favorite.  The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the author is very clear that it's a little different in the way she chooses to deal with her own issues.  The book is a bit slow at times and it's a bit hard to follow at times as you're trying to figure out who the main character is and who they are.  It's very refreshing to have a book that is written in the style of a book that is written with a great feel for a story.  I especially like the way the author describes the characters and the theme of the story.  I really liked the way the author gave us an idea of who

0,"After watching the Sharpe series on video I decided to read them in print.  Bernard Cornwell wrote this book first, although chronologically it is not the first in the life of Richard Sharpe.  What a great story!  It has all the elements of a great adventure.  This book is a page-turner from the very beginning.  This is a great book for the history buff - or anyone who loves an adventure.  One of the things I like about Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books is that they are great stand alone stories and you don't feel that you need to read the entire series in a particular order to enjoy them.  I have bought several copies of Sharpe's Eagle and given them as presents to those hard-to-buy-for men on my shopping lists."

0,"Our two labs roam our acreage doing their rabbit/mouse/fieldrat routine every day, come rain or shine no matter what the season.  They often came home in the summer afternoon covered in several types of burrs, fescue seed, mud covered noses, dirty faces, and tongues hanging out the sides.  But of course, they've brought home several kinds of ticks who had free loaded back to the homestead.  Going over every inch of their ""happy to see you, dad, I had fun"" bodies was a nightly ritual.  I say WAS because we then discovered the Preventic tick collars.  These collars are the greatest invention since the riding lawn mower!  Now the only ticks we see are the live ones crawling on top of their fur looking for just the right place to bite.  If one does happen to attach, it will be dead within 24 hours.  These collars last 90 days before they need to be replaced.  We put them on the dogs at the first of May when the first ticks appear (although I think the little suckers can crawl at -10 degrees on top of inch thick ice!) and then again at the first of August.  This application keeps the grinning duo tick free and both their lives and our lives much happier.  But I feel they kinda miss the attention of daddy tick hunting their bodies every day.  The dogs have never had the slightest skin irritation due to the collars but we don't but them on extremely tight.  I can still get four fingers under them.  The other nice thing about the collars is that if for some reason they get their collars caught in a fence or a limb, they are easily stretched so the dogs can get themselves loose without choking .  We've had one collar lost only once in the four years we've used the collars and although expensive to lose a collar, well worth knowing the dog wasn't hurt."
1,"My little fur baby was a little too small for him but it fits him just fine!  It is so cute and cute. I also love the fact that the clasp is adjustable so it doesn't slip around the neck like a collar. This one is still in good shape but I don't think I will order it again. I will definitely be ordering another one. We have a great, happy cat and dog and we use this as a treat to keep our dogs busy for a while."

0,"I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online. Unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. When we arrived, we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold. So, we had to move to another hotel. Amalfi did take care of the other hotel, cab fare, and after much negotiating...breakfast. We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient. Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned, we had to get up, pack up our suitcases, check out of the hotel, take a cab, check back into the Amalfi, only then could we head to the museum. We were also told that our first night's stay would be refunded. Well, more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later...there still hasn't been a refund. I can't even get a manager to call me back. The Amalfi wasn't all bad, it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance. The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. However, it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended. One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles, but they seemed really small for queens. Our view from our room was of the alley. So, overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor. Very disappointing indeed!"

0,"I love every single thing about the Race to the Treasure game.  I love that the instructions are printed on the inside of the box so you can never lose the instructions.  (If you happen to lose the box all of the instructions are located on their website)  I love that all the pieces come in a reusable pouch, not those plastic bags that get thrown away.  I love that all of the materials are all recycled but all have a very high quality feel.  Most of all, I love the sheer genius that is a cooperative game.  Sure, it is important for kids to know what it feels like to win and to lose, and we still play games like Monopoly Junior where there is a clear winner but when there is too much ""I WIN I WIN"" going on in the house I pull out Peaceable Kingdom's Race to the Treasure or Hoot Owl Hoot.  Cooperative games require all players to work together as a team to win.  At first I thought there was no way my 5 year old would fall for this, he is competitive and loves to chant ""I WIN I WIN"".  Much to my surprise, he loves all of the Peaceable Kingdom games we have played.  My 5 year old son loves to help his 3 year old brother because it ultimately helps them both ""win"" the game.  And two winners is always better than one, right?  Race to the Treasure is my favorite Peaceable Kingdom game.  The goal is to create a path to pick up three keys and get to the finish before the ogre gets you.  The game requires some thinking and strategy of how you'll pick up the keys and get to the finish but most importantly, it requires the players to work together to decide which path is the best way.  It's pretty amazing to see kids working together for a common goal rather than plotting against one another for the glory."

0,"The price and comfortability of this mask were the 2 best things about it, which are 2 very important things to have in a mask. The negative, for me, was the fogginess. I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well. It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3. If that was not the case, I might be tempted for a 5 star review, but 4.5 is probably more accurate. Great feel, comfort, size, and price."

I love how the heroine is a strong heroine who is strong. I liked how the story was written. I liked how the main character was a strong woman. I was a little confused at first, but I found it very entertaining.I'm a huge fan of the M/M genre.

I recommend this series to anyone looking for a good romance.I love this series.  I was waiting for the next book, so I was glad I got it.  It was a fast, easy read that kept me interested.  I look forward to reading more of the series.I'm not a big fan of the old-fashioned type of science fiction.  I know that this is a science fiction novel, and that there is an emphasis on a series and a book.  The characters are well developed, and the story line is believable.

1,"We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel. We found it conveniently located on E. Superior Street, near many local attractions. The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. The pillow menu was awesome, my partner and I have such different preferences, the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! I couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. My Beagle, Betsy enjoyed her stay at the 'Jet Set Pet' care center. She was pampered as much as I was. It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit. It included an iPod Shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist, a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours, and comfort items like a towel and map! I felt like I was the most important guest (surely, everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel!!"

0,"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).  Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...  OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.  I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money."

0,"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim. Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.  And unlike Joe Levine, none of US owned the screen rights to THE CARPETBAGGERS . . ."

I don't know who made the bed up in my room, but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. Ditto the bathroom. Water spots, soap scum and (ugh) hair of ALL kinds in the sink, tub and about the floor. GROSS. I requested non-smoking, either they didn't listen or didn't care, but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. The 'beautiful view' was ruined by water spots - not outside(which is forgiveable) but INSIDE! And they were sticky. I stayed only one night. The Holiday Inn had rooms available, and they were clean.

0,"I have never read anything about this author before, and I have to say that I was delighted with his work. I enjoyed this novel a lot, and it gave me a good glimpse of what life can be for a well-off older couple in modern Israel. How they cope with everyday life, family issues, death, mourning, separation, etc. It was a slow read, but not boring at all. It all happens during an eight-day holiday; Hanukkah. And with the lighting of each candle we get to see how the past and present of this family unfolds.  However, I would have liked to know more of some characters, like the couple's son and daughter, for example, or the grandfather, but you still get some hints as to what their lives are like. You can pretty much put the puzzle together, or develop the characters in your mind any way you want. After all the story revolves around the married couple, Daniela and Amotz, who by the way make a nice couple. The brother in law, Yirmiyahu, is so mysterious and obscure, that you get hooked with him trying to unravel his mind and feelings. Africa seems then the appropriate setting for this man, and all that surrounds him enhances the mystery. And he does spice the book a lot. Overall, I think it's a good read, and an enjoyable book."
0,"My husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night. I called the hotel and spoke with Eric, he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation, he said no and that was the end of it. My husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookit.com as well. I called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement. I informed courtney from bookit.com that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by Eric. She spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name. I got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he 'didnt recall' saying that. I was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied!!!!!!!!!!! He said, no ma'am i dont remember saying that. I said so since you dont remember thats it??? I said my husband heard him say it b/c he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there. I asked to speak to Erica, told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on. I asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth. I have never writte. A review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this. Erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN!!"
0,"I was cleaning out some boxes of children's books, keeping what I consider classic while giving the rest to my grandchildren or to the libraries. I doubled-back between this current edition and the previous editions to make sure this was the same one...it is, and I highly recommend this. I took a class in children's literature back in the 70's and I fondly remember it as being one of the most enjoyable classes I had in college the first time around. This book lasted through my children's growing up and is now going through new useage with my grandchildren. I love the way this book is organized. If you have a child with specific interests such as limericks (and I know few children who don't get a kick out of limericks) you can go to that section without delay. I grew up with Joan Walsh Anglund poignant drawings. They are not particularly 'great' art, but for children and in this book, they are vastly more suitable than the poorly drawn and maddening stuff put out in cartoons (especially of the Pokemon variety which will set off seizures in children). They say the age of this book is for four years to eight year olds. That isn't true. Every parent should try to take the time to read to all children in whatever form necessary...and it should start at age one. Reading aloud (or signing books) to your children not only makes essential bonds, but it also teaches children what you think is important, and also teaches them how to stop and pay attention. The massive complaints about restless children and the abuse of labeling (ADD/ADHD) has its beginnings in simple things such as turning the television/computers off and reading to your children. ... should be showing the pictures and pages of this book in a sampling, so that parents can make informed decisions about children's books. If you only get one child's book this year, get this one and sit down with your children and read. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"

0,"READ THIS BOOK!!!  I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. He was required to read this book for a college economics class. I absolutly fell in love with this book. I do not read much, so an 1100 page book is a big undertaking for me. I will pass on what my friend told me:  The first 200 pages will seem slow because of the character discriptions and history. Give it those 200 pages and you will be hooked and it will read a lot faster. It is amazing that one person could compile everything that is in this book. What a work of art. As a reader, you will definetly start looking at the issues surrounding you in a different light. Only negative:  ""The Speach"" at the end of the book. It's way too long winded and over the head. Suggestion:  Listen to this speach on youtube to help get through it."

0,"Please visit my blog for more reviews! :) [...]  Delirium was a delightful read! I had just finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and so Delirium was a great book to read while I was in that ""Dystopian"" book phase (which I still am). Delirium is set in a Dystopian future where their society believes that love is a disease that people can be cured of at the age of 18. Lena has just a little over three months before she turns 18, but she falls in love. She meets a boy named Alex who woos her, they fall in love, and then it kind of has a twist at the end... one that makes you go... ""Wait! WHAT!?! WHY!?""  What I liked I really liked Lauren Oliver's style of writing. The plot never seemed choppy, it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter which is always a plus. The plot is kind of original and I say ""kind of"" because it is a Dystopian novel and these kinds of novels always have something outlawed, or forbidden. The forbidden thing in this novel would be the feeling of love. This means that you are matched with some one who you don't love, and you will never love. They will be your roommate who sleeps in the same bed with you. When you have kids you will only be watching and taking care of them out of duty, not out of love.  What I didn't like Nothing. I really, really liked this book.  How did I read this book I read this book on my nook, but it is one of those books that I want to have in paper form as well."

1,"Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand. My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary. After looking at several hotels in the 'Magnificent Mile' territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad. The Conrad's website impressed us immediately. The pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September. My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. It cost a pretty penny, more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad. Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. That ended when we found out that our 'view' was of a back alley service corridor. So much for the skyline. Overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. The spa had very limited hours as well. Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago. I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago. I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet."

Had a security guy come out for estimate of a real camera, & he said ""why do you want a camera here, you already have one""?  I told him it was fake.

1,"My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable. My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me 'in the system'. We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. The room that I had originally reserved (King) was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room. I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service. It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. When finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it. So now I am cranky, tired and starving! I ate what I could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms. The woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago. I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again."

0,"this really should not come up in the sub category for external hard drive enclosures. This item is meant for use in a bench situation in a hardware shop. The cover is extremely easy to open, so easy that it does not even latch properly, although it has small plastic ridges that seem to indicate it should. You cannot turn it sideways at all; the cover will just flip open. it is also open at the back. if I were still working in a hardware shop, this would be awesome. Its my bad for misreading the title and not looking at all the pictures, but it should really be in a different category. I'm going to return it and get something else for home use."

0,"I love this series, one of the very few I will pre-order and autobuy. Jenna Bennett has a way of capturing my attention from the first page and holding it till the very last page. She blends humor, suspense, relationship  and mystery into storylines that keeps me coming back for more. I can't wait to see what happens next. But best of all is the relationship between Savannah and Rafe.  It's a Wow! This book takes place a month after the last one ends.  Savannah is now five months pregnant and it is the height of summertime in Nashville. She  learns former clients from a previous book are getting threatening letters when they advise her they may have to sell the house they love because of the threat.  Savannah begins to investigate, but the house's previous  owner is murdered before she can talk to him and then one of the current  homeowners is attacked in a home invasion. Can she solve the mystery behind the threat before it turns on her?"
1,"This is a decent helmet, but the design is a bit of a disappointment. I have one in my 6th-door SUV, and it is the first one I have worn. The helmet is well made and looks good on it. The construction is very good. The helmet does not leak. The only negative is the padding, which is a little on the small side. I will probably just buy a new one.This is an excellent product. I have used it for a year and have never had any problems with it. I use it for my elliptical workout and it has lasted me years. It is easy to use and it has a nice feel.

0,"When is the next book??  Wow!  This was sooo good!  It was very hard for me to put this book down once I started it.  The story was well written to the point I cried at times.  I could feel the pain and angst the main character, Ana, was going through.  Ana doesnt reveal what happened in her past right away but there were enough hints that I was heartbroken for her.  I was rooting for Ana through the whole book and it was a complete rollercoaster for her (as well as for me!!).  I don't want to give anything away as to what happened with Ana but there is a huge cliffhanger at the end of the book. It was one of those that sucked the air out of my lungs because I couldn't believe what just happened.  It was one of those endings that I had to sit back and give myself some time to digest and figure out what I will read next.  Book 2 isn't currently out or it would be a no brainer what my next book was."

1,All Cornwell's novels are great. I love the way they are written.
0,"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  I wasn't particularly interested in ""Office Space"" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does ""Office Space"" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.  Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but ""Office Space"" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.  Mike Judge obviously felt compelled to split open the unexplored injustice of white-collar slavery and definitely makes it work. This isn't a gross-out comedy full of outrageous behavior (I don't know if the bludgeoning of the copy machine counts), but if you want to unwind after a tough day of school or work and enjoy a downright funny-as-hell movie, you're making the right decision to owe this one a few bucks."

0,"PROS: 1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks. CONS: 1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly. 2. Runs very hot and noisy. 3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily. TIPS: 1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time. 2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment."

0,"THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told I'd be getting a king bed. When I check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. I protested to no avail. When I got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago. For the pleasure, I paid the same price as a normal king bed room. The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. We would wake up with body aches and headaches. My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. Not good. Also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in. It's not really worth it. ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. Some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. They would also come at vastly different times. HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime. I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. No other hotel I've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. Late checkout? charge. Shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. The front deck 'gold passport' people can't even figure out how to get you points. In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again). By the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. The bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. The food is edible too, but I wouldn't brag about it. The hotel is not directly on the main street (Michigan), but it's not too far from it. It's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the Navy Pier. Our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park. It's a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though. If you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to Wildberry on Randolph st. It'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! CONCLUSION I get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western. Save the money and stay elsewhere."

0,"We booked through a travel website. This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September. The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done. The hallway was so dimly lit, we couldn't see how to use the key card. The shock came when we entered the room. Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest's comfort into consideration. The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress (rock hard) over a platform. The 'nigh stands' were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height. The room was stark - all off-white, no color. No art work or any decoration at all. The full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit; if it were winter and the heat was on, I think this could be dangerous. There was a desk & chair but no clock/radio in the room; there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection. The bathroom was very small but clean. The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to. An older person could have never stayed in the room. Because of the renovation, there was no restaurant on-site. No vending or ice available on the floor either I can't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel. I would never stay there again."

0,"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.  The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches. Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.  Pros: *Saves a ton of room *Hardware included that worked well *Easy to install  Cons: *None  Additional Considerations: Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.  Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars  If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."

I particularly found the introduction of the Goth twins a bit unnecessary, but I can see they were necessary to help tie up some loose ends. The abrupt move to Eureka Springs felt just that, abrupt. While Phoebe is the source of all things bountiful, her purchase of the new house and the ease at which the gang made their move seemed forced. Sure, they had to get the heck out of Dodge, but establishing roots somewhere with no real investigation of the new location seemed odd. Three stars does not mean ""bad"" it just means it was an okay read. Nothing will stop me from hoping that there is a book seven as I really want to know what they make of their new home and how Phoebe will resolve her quest for meaning in her life. On a technical note, there were several typos which drive me nuts."

0,"I'll keep it short. My wife, daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. Location: It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. Hotel: The hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. Maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (I think they missed a night). Service: Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. There was no shortage of people to ask things. My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. They shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. Other: We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. Pool and changing areas were spotless. Room: Clean, sunny and spacious. Probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 TVs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. The windows open for some fresh air. Pillows were pretty comfortable. With all aspects considered, I think this was an unbeatable value! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. The airlines have cornered the market on that."

It's a great way to get some cool party favors and a bunch of fun items to play with.  The items are really nice and colorful.  They are a little difficult to put together but they work great and they're not too big.  It's a fun little set for little ones to play with.I bought these for my 9 year old for her birthday. She loved them! They are pretty sturdy and she was able to hold them in her hands and they held up well to the abuse we had in the house. So far, she loves playing with them and playing with them at all times. They are soft and cuddly so you can take them everywhere with you. We haven't had any issues with any of the toys being thrown or kicked. The toys are durable and they don't fall apart easily, so it's not a problem for"

0,"Kristin Hannah is among my most favorite authors. This story is among her most unusual subjects. Very interesting. I love this era and I have read many books about the war, the people, the horror of it all and yet war has such a romantic aura about it . ""The Nightingale "" does not disappoint. It gave me yet another bit of insight into that terrible war against humanity. I would recommend this book to my friends."
0,"I bought this for a little girl's birthday and it was a huge success. The additional styling tools are okay, but really I payed the extra money for this doll versus the one without the additional tools because this one has a better dress that is a little truer to the actual Elsa dress with the sheer over-lay."
0,"I was looking for a heavy-duty belt to handle my heavy, leather, tool pouches. It's not quite as heavy as I would have liked, but it does a more than adequate job. I have no complaints about it. It is a simple design and seemingly rugged in construction. I haven't worn it in the summertime, so I can't comment on the earlier reviewer's complaint that the color bleeds when you sweat. I am curious to see if that is the case."

0,"Nice flip up BUIS - push the button and the POP right up - kinda cool.  They sit nice and snug on picatinny rail but a little wide bodied on the base.  The rear sight has notched center line that matches up with eye hole - so that was good for centering the sight sight and I was able to adjust sight in quickly.  You might want to snug down the screws with some lock tight as that the rear sight came loose after several rounds and these screws require a allen wrench, so bring one along just in case.  My main sight is a fiber optics and these are just backups and I am pleased with them for the money - not a bad deal."

1,"This was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. For this week's vacation in Chicago, I heard several recommendations regarding lodging, but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. I expected an experience of comfort, luxury and customer satisfaction, but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. The design is breathtaking -- modern, clean, stylish, sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby, shops and restaurants, to the stunning guest rooms themselves. My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in, and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. Far from a traditional hotel experience, this was like moving into chic, exclusive downtown apartment, and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. Impressive, too, was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage, the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world, and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. It's a respect that shows through, too, in other areas: support for artistic organizations, charities and other programs of merit, as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay, whether for a weekend, a week, or longer. The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. In fact, we may visit again solely to stay at the James!"

Dog loved it, but humans, not so much. Kind of stinky like a strong hot dog smell and produces a lot of crumbs that the pup ignored until they were dumped in her bowl.  So for us, it is a sometimes treat vs the pork chomp sticks which she enjoys weekly."

I bought this for my wife to use with her iPad mini and it works perfectly. She loves it!  She doesn't have a lot of space to store anything other than the iPad, but I don't need to worry about that. She uses it for a lot of things, including drawing, pictures, etc. She loves it!Works perfectly, no problems with the software or even my keyboard.

If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.  Finally: overall, it is a very absorbent, very soft, very well-made towel.

It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper. One teeny tiny bubble that I can live with.

But it is a compelling one.  ""The Hood"" is one of those films where the camera is shooting it's moments of terror.  The film is shot with great accuracy, and the actors are superb as they take to the screen to make the film feel real.  I've seen it many times before, and I never saw it as a horror film.

The 'fitness center' is an oversized closet! We were appalled during our stay! Truly anticipated 'warm, Irish hospitality' and short of a barman, no one was Irish, warm or hospitable! Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request. Her manager (?) refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us. Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7:30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate. To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI! The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all. The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade-off."

When I checked in, the staff was very attentive, I showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude (small tip) and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar! I didn't get the 'Priceline' glare and it paid off for all involved. The air and water show was underway on the lake front, and we had planes flying over our room. The kids thought it was great. That night we had a great view of the fireworks at Navy Pier. The Sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason. The conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly. It was one of the best times we ever had in Chicago."

0,"It was hard to tell from the picture or the description whether the bowls were plastic or metal, and I unfortunately assumed the latter, but was wrong.  Plastic bowls are not great for most breeds of dogs, as they harbor bacteria, and obviously can be chewed, which can cause irritation and/or cuts and scrapes to the dogs face and mouth.  Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.  Because the design of this feeder is so round and wide, the ""legs"" are just slightly too wide for the tray in the bottom of the crate.  This would probably be a decent feeder for someone who doesn't mind lots of plastic or that have a larger area for the feeder.  It's definitely not compact or discreet, though it does seem to be sturdy for an all plastic product."

Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. It is sadly just not suited for my body. On me - it lets all of the wrong things hang out (I'll upload a photo to show what I mean). Fit wise, for the most part it did fit me as it should, even the breast area provided appropriate coverage. I just was not at all comfortable in this suit. I still gave it 3 stars because the return process was fast and easy. I won't say that there is anything wrong with this suit because as I stated the other reviewer looks fantastic in it and she says she feels great in it. Guess it's just not for everyone!!"

1,"This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere. It smells because pets are allowed. This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed. There was mold in our room and bathroom, pet hair everywhere! Kids love pools. How can they claim to be kid friendly without one? My kid was bored. The food was basically the same every day, no variation in the menu. Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their 'travel club' because our room didn't even remotely resemble the pictures. They did the old bait and switch. We reserved a 'family room'. When we opened the door of our room, we realized that it wasn't what the website pictured or had what the website described. We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers. Definitely do not recommend this hotel!!!"

0,"I needed a frame to put my king size matress on to get it up off the floor. I didn't have a box spring so I needed something with support. I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came for an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat. Now I will be honest, I am not sure how this  bed would hold up if I had owned it in my younger days, back when we were ""getting busy""  on a regular basis, but I would highly recommend it for a bed that is used for sleeping!!!"

I did not know about the ending, but I was really excited. I just watched the second season and I am so glad I did. It's very sad that they chose to make this one. The series has been going on since the early 90s, and this is a great show to watch.I was very disappointed with the video quality of the movie.  I found it quite bland and I don't know if it would be worth the money for it to be a 3D movie.  It was not the best of the bunch.

0,The author could have gone into more depth about covert bigotry.  THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.  The author should be commended for presenting the bigotry on the part of Muslim's and that it cuts both ways.  Maybe more depth would have been possible if not as much time was spent on the grieving that takes place after you lose your spouse.

0,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!  To see what N.K.'s idea behind Brandon's reflection was head over to the HEA blog!"

0,Pretty good product. It's way better made than the Luggable Loo toilet seat. It's a thicker plastic and there is also a rubber seal inside the lid to give it a snug fit when you close it.

0,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience. The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel. Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride. The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. I don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby, the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. The pool/spa/excercise room was not very impressive either. It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor, wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. There is also no hot tub and the 'spa' is a closet with a massage table. The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the 'sheraton promise' phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. The beds were super comfortable. I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago."

0,"Life has not been kind to John Moon.  Depressed because his wife left him, he spends his lonely days planning a reunion that will never happen.  Living alone in a cramped, dirty trailer, he leads a hand to mouth existence.  Chronically unemployed, he has taken to poaching to put food on his table.  One morning, Moon hunts and wounds a deer.  Tracking the animal to a nearby rock quarry, he senses movement behind him.  Reacting instinctively,  he whirls and fires a single shot into the surrounding wood, and sees something brown crash to the ground.  Assuming he has downed the deer, he begins to walk towards the trees.  It is only after he is charged by the wounded deer that he realizes he must have shot something else.  When Moon investigates, he discovers the body of a young woman.  Struggling to stay calm, Moon conducts a search of  the area, and discovers the girl's belongings, along with a package containing some $80,000 in cash.  Moon, overwhelmed by events, decides to hide the body and take the cash.  Shortly thereafter, he finds himself at the center of a bizarre series of events, as the money's owners eventually trace it back to him.  Moon, unable to contact the authorities, becomes involved in a life or death game of cat and mouse with ruthless criminals who have only one goal--to get their money back at all costs.  A Single Shot is a convincing portrait of a simple man caught up in circumstances beyond his control.  Moon's anxiety and despair is palpable, and the sense of menace Jones creates is almost overwhelming at times.  Grim and macabre, this gripping saga of small town mayhem and madness will shock and disturb you.  Reminiscent of the work of Jack Ketchum and James Dickey,  A Single Shot really hits the mark."

I used this to make a little bread in the oven, then it was ready to go.  The bread is so easy to clean and it is so easy to clean.  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works very well.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too small for the little bread I made, but it was perfect for the baked bread I made.  It is definitely worth the money.I bought this as a gift.  I had some other candles and this one does the job perfectly.

0,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."

I am on the fence about what to expect from this author. I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I wish there was more. I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine. The story is very well written and I liked how she is in a relationship with her man. I like that the story is not over. I love how the heroine is a strong woman and the relationship is not over. It is a cute romance. I would recommend it. This is a good story with lots of twists and turns.

Another problem with the IE6 is that they're too loud (115db/V), meaning you'd need an extra volume control if you plug it into an airplane audio socket. The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30.

1,"I purchased this at a discount on Amazon. com. I will update this review if I find a cheaper price. The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The bulb is not in the same position as the rest of the bulbs. The light is not a very bright white, and it has a very low output (just a single beam). I was hoping that the bulb would be brighter, but it is not. The bulb is not very bright, but I have no doubt that it will last for years, and is still a great value. It is a great value for a good price. This is a very good lamp. I like the fact that it does not have a ""lock"" which means that it can be turned off with the ""lock"" button. I have no idea how to turn it off without this lock, but it does not have the lock button as it is in the picture. I bought a new set and this is the only one I have. I use it to go to the bathroom when I am away from the house. It is a nice lamp that does not turn on when it is dark. It is not the best lamp I have ever owned, but it is perfect. I will buy more of this lamp in the future. This is a good product. I am very happy with the quality of the product. I use it for reading in a dimmer. I have purchased two more for my son's room, one for a bedroom and one for a bathroom. The one that I use is a standard, incandescent light."

0,"I really hated Annabel's family with all my tiny heart and soul. And I did not understand why Annabel just didn't go work in the fields by herself and leave her family to their own devices. That was really odd and kind of annoying.  Other than that, this book was decent enough. It's not the worst one I've ever read. I think there could have been a lot less bashing-you-over-the-head-with-religion, as in, it could have been much more subtly (and thus skillfully) done.  Stephen's character could have been fleshed out a lot more. He was kind of just in the background for most of the time, and so the part that focused on him didn't have as much impact as it could have. I like le Wyse and I liked Annabel, but their relationship was a little ""eh."" I loved Eustacia but thought she talked like Yoda. Most of the language in this book was a little weirdly done. I get that the author was trying to evoke the 1300s, but she didn't pull it off unfortunately. It just came off weird and it was very distracting to read the characters talk like normal people and then say ""Nay."" It reminded me of that John Pinette sketch ""I say nay nay!""  I thought the storyline with the baliff was well done, though I could have lived without Gilbert and Adam's characters. Same with Beatrice - did that actually have a point or not really?  This is a good, light read for when you just need a book that doesn't require your brain to function."

I have gotten gold bulbs that are called amber, even with GE numbers that formerly corresponded to imprints on bulbs that look like the dark amber ones.  I have also searched imprinted dark anber bulb GE parts numbers and found a florescent bulb.  These bulbs are very price, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.  One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.  At least this seller could guarantee they were dark amber."

It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable."

I would not recommend it. Also, it is not a good material for wearing under a bra or on a tank top. I will say that if you wear it under a dress or on a skirt, it is very uncomfortable.

1,"With an ear hook design, it's an impressive soundstage.  The only drawback is the speaker is so small that it's not portable.  The plastic earpieces are very large and bulky.  The only thing I like about this model is the price.  If you have a large ear, it's a great option.  If you have a small ear, you'll probably want to get a second pair.

The author does not delve into the details of the construction of the universe, but instead does a great job of explaining how the universe works, and how to make it work for you.  The book has a lot of fun, and is very educational. I think that this book will help you to become a better person, and I would highly recommend it.This book was just ok.  I had read the book several times and was a little disappointed.

Maintenance took a look at it, and couldn't figure it out. Told me I'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. He then passed some gas and left. Real professional. I phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first. Horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. Bathroom was incredibly small. Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. Very cramped. The beds weren't very comfortable either. Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy. Location seem very convenient. I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. But all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two.

So much fun to use that after I'd had it for a while I found myself looking for ways to use some of the attachments I hadn't yet needed.  The only thing that's not so great is it seems to be in a box meant for more than one model - so there are molded places to put things that aren't included.  That takes up space in the box that could be better used to store what DOES come inside & would make it easier to put stuff away.

Jamie is a special type of witches breed and her power is coveted by more dangerous, powerful beings who kill anyone who gets in their way. Tiger-shifter Aiden Shrader is one of the Watchmen assigned to them, and an instant attraction develops between Olivia and him. Forced to drive a long distance trip to safety, they can't help being around each other, nor stop the desire flaming.  Aiden was raised by a horrid man who sexually abused him. Finally able to get away, he doesn't consider himself worthy of any woman, especially a human one. Yet, he will go to any lengths to protect Olivia, even die for her if he has to. Hot on their heels are the bad demons and undeadlies. Can Aiden and his fellow Watchmen stop them from capturing or hurting Olivia and Jamie? Will Aiden be able to hide his tiger-shifter powers from being exposed to Olivia and thus, frightening her?

For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end. A major bonus point for the author providing a list of glossary of terms so as to not confuse the reader, especially since if, like me, this is your first foray into the Watchmen series. It made it easy to catch up to speed. A fascinating tale, be sure to consider picking up a copy of Touch of Seduction"

0,"I didn't like this book and I didn't like Sally Mann.  It was the most boring book I have read in a long time.  First of all, she really puts a great emphases on how smart she supposedly is.  She includes notes from elementary, high school and college teachers.  Pardon me while I yawn.    This book is interspersed with photos, copies of notes and letters, and anything Mann throws in to make herself look good.  Her notoriety comes from the nude photos she took of her children growing up.  Many people found them sexually suggestive.  I found them exploitive but not really offensive.  Mann spends time defending herself on the photos calling herself nave time and time again.  That's OK for awhile but it gets tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all.  She is shocked that pedophiles are interested in them. Really?    She also separates the pictures from the children.  She says the children are merely actors in the pictures and can keep the two separate identities apart even the 6 year old. Then she goes on to say how nice it is to have pictures of their childhood.  Which is it?  Are they separate or true depictions?    After that she goes on to explore past relations.  She discusses her husband's parents murder/suicide.  Then she goes on to discuss kinfolk in even the more distant past.  This is when I lost complete interest and just thumbed through the rest of the book's pictures.  By then I was so turned off that I didn't even enjoy them.    This was definitely not the book for me."

0,"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...]. One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it! When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally. Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched. A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way. I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year. I'd encourage anyone to try this out,it's a good one.  JUST DON'T PINCH OR PULL ON THE WIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

1,"I bought this thinking it would be the only one I would purchase.  It's been one of the few I haven't had a problem with.  I think the reason I bought this is because my dog is a very picky eater.  This one is a bit more expensive, but it's still a good product.  I'd be more inclined to buy this if it were offered at a higher price.I used it for two years and it has held up very well.  I have a young dog and I have a very picky eater.  I just switched to this product after I saw it work.  It has been working great.  It is a very good product for my dog.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.I like the fact that it comes with a variety of different colors. I have a 10 year old Lab and he loves this.My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. She loves to play with it and I thought it would be fun. However, he was a little too big for her. I gave it 5 stars because it is a good size for her. I think it is perfect for her. I think it will work for her if she gets bigger. I also think it will work for her if she grows a little more.I have a dog who is a bully, and this toy has helped calm him down. I put him through his paces, and it's helped him learn how to bark and walk. It's been about a month now and"

0,"Sad that catholics in america, who have eaten so heartily at the protestant table, while bringing so many terrors into the country, would want just more ""spin.""  Against a backdrop of their open border policy (Hart-Celler), the legacy of Kennedy's, the Jesuits inciting Latinos with ""liberation theology""  (anti-anglo-protestantism) to ensure newcomers will be filled with that peculiar hate as the border is opened for them---- such same old!  And instead of a warning to them, and in the world where the Catholic murder of Christians in Serbia so recently (oh, is that just a big silly thing that should be put in ""histoical context"" also?) is known to so many--- one wonders.  Do such people ever begin to take in anything at all of ""the other?""  Even as they moralize?  Even as they harm?  Even as they do not look at their own real history, but only seek to cover it?"

0,"I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night. I was debating getting a second one simply for better symmetry, but the one lantern as it is looks perfectly fine, even charming by itself."

A little bigger than I expected but sometimes I wear two pair of socks so I think think I'll keep the size I have. Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them. I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!  I lowered to a 3 from a 5.  The first pair were great but the second pair I bought took months to break in and caused so many blisters.  The waterproofing failed in one shoe fairly quickly so rainy days at work suck."

0,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."

0,"I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.  On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.  Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.  I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand."

0,"Received a copy of the title in exchange for an honest review.  This was a super quick, sweet little read that follows a jaded journalist and a male romance novelist. I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac. The reader goes through the entire emotional wheel with Sheridan as she's told she's not getting the assignment she wants, and then through her falling process.  Like I said, I wish it had been longer, but this is a good taste at the writing of Sara Hantz"

0,"This movie is as funny as parts of the other 2 at times but i wouldnt say its as good. It has some funny moments but also some very stupid non funny moments. The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator. Overall i give it 3 and a half stars. Pretty good."

0,"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.  Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.  Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder."
0,"I arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery. They put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when I arrived. The front desk staff gave me the key to my room and I put my stuff away and went to meet the group. We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon. We went to speak with the front desk. We were met with 'We can't do anything about that right now due to the hour. We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in.' Unacceptable!!! My $1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room! Not my mistake! FINALLY, after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes, they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered. She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon. All of my belongings were recovered in the security room; however, all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation! Terrible, terrible customer service. They sent up an apology letter, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries to the room. Although I was appreciative of the gesture, it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say 'We can't do anything about it.'"

0,"As a lifelong Lakers fan and the absolute biggest Boston Celtics hater you will ever find, I was somewhat doubtful whether I should buy this book. I was well aware of the sports guys almost pathological hatred of great Lakers such as Kareem and Kobe and I did not think he could do a book and be fair in his pyramid ratings of them, nor anyone who didn`t play for the Celtics. I finally got the book and am glad I did. Simmons took plenty of shots at Kareem, but, ultimately gave him a 3rd best player ever rating. At the beginning of the book, Simmons went into great detail as to why he says Bill Russell was a greater player than Wilt, and his arguments and historical proof of his opinion was so accurate that I have to change my own opinion ad go over to the Sports Guys side-Russ was better than Wilt. His rating of Kobe at only the 15th best player ever was ridiculous. With Kobe`s 4th ring won in 2009 (without Shaq to you Kobe haters) was the final hurdle he had to get over to be rated as one of the top 7 or 8 players ever. West and Oscar won one championship each, Wilt and Kareem were the MVP`s on the teams that they did win their one ring on, and Kobe has won 4 and, yet, Simmons rates him behind both of them? Laughable. No sport places a higher premium on the all time status of players being based on championships won than pro basketball. With that truth, Bird with 3 rings, rated way higher than Kobe with his 4. Well, thats just the Celtic bias coming through since Simmons makes quite clear he thinks the sun sets on Bird`s rear end. Oh well, basically the book was fair, it was funny , it was worth 700 pages and would be a nice addition to any basketball fans library."

0,"The world depicted by this book (and what I believe will be expounded on in the next two sequels) follows a few principles of communism - equality, submissiveness, trust, and longevity of life.  Thus, the main conflict is on the issue of ""freedom of choice"".  Being ""Matched"" infers that a pairing decision was made by someone else (an authority) and is similar to an arranged marriage.  The story focuses on how 3 teens cope with this reality as they ""come of age"".  The book is written from a first person perspective.  It is very well written and edited.  The pacing is slower than other dystopian contemporaries, but the flipside of this is a richer narrative of the main character's thoughts, logic, emotion and confusion (I wouldn't quite define it as angst).  Because life is often a battle between money and principle, love and infatuation, organization and creativity, and democracy and autocracy, I think this book is relevant to most people.  It all depends on whether you have the time to spend thinking about these thoughts and options."
0,"A great first book to begin ones journey with the ancient Vikings fascinating age of expansion from the 700s to 1100s. Thanks to their Vikings ships, they covered great geographical areas by crossing oceans and sailing up river routes. Sure they were ferocious warriors to start with when exploring new lands, but they loved peace and harmony as well as evidenced by their successful integration with natives through matrimony, conversion to Christianity, peaceful trading and adopting local customs and assuming local names.  Thanks to archeology and artefacts scattered in all the lands they covered, we know today they were so well integrated in the lands they ventured to that their graves intermingled with the graves of the natives.  An insight into the ancient Vikings will throw great light onto what we witness of Scandinavian societies today. Their pride and joy is deeply rooted in their path to Christianity and the bridges they built with the natives of many lands."

Her preference is for the Nike and Under Armor slide ins, but she says these will do well in those moments where her good shin guards go missing.  The size large in the Franklin brand are pretty much the same size as her Nike slide ins, so I think these run a bit on the small side.

0,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."
0,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."

The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting, was close to the theater, and had what seemed to be a good rate. What a huge mistake. The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. The room was not clean, the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving, they never bothered to come turn down the beds, and the late check-out 'priviledges' which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became 'upon request' - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. Dont' waste your time or your money here. At best, it's nothing special. Personally, I like the Fairmont in Chicago, but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco."

0,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.  The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.  Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."

0,"The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic story about what happens to a foolish puppet who does not listen to the wise advice of others and who disobeys his unselfish father Geppetto.  From the moment he comes to life Pinocchio causes trouble.  He chooses not to listen to the Talking Cricket, a black-bird, a Parrot, and a Fairy with blue hair.  Pinocchio encounters a (supposedly) lame Fox and a (supposedly) blind Cat who dupe him into putting money in the (alleged) Field of Riches.  After skipping school Pinocchio narrowly escapes a vicious police dog and a hungry green fisherman.  Pinocchio becomes a donkey (Collodi makes good use of symbolism here!) as a result of his visit to Funville.  The donkey becomes lame after tripping in a circus act.  A man comes along to purchase the lame donkey so the animal's skin can be used to make a drum.  After being thrown into the sea with a stone around his neck the donkey changes back into a puppet.  Pinocchio is then swallowed by a shark and discovers that his father has suffered the same fate.  Father and son both escape and Pinocchio becomes a real boy.  The moral of this story is fairly clear: Our bad decisions and foolish choices have negative consequences.  Though this story is targeted to children (boys in particular) the lessons presented in this book can apply to adults as well.  The version of this story in this review is an adaption and is designed for younger readers.  However, adults will enjoy this wonderful story about a classic literary character and the error of his ways.  The book concludes with a brief biographical sketch of Carlo Collodi."

0,"While the teaser on the book jacket moved me to buy this book, I couldn't finish reading it. The writing is uninspired, predictable. The story seems formulaic, safe - the sad stories of several women who meet at a knitting circle. The sadness is brought out pretty well, especially initially about the main character Mary's loss. But too much of sadness going on and on works against the story, I feel, so I began to ignore the emotional meanings and look for the story.  I tried to keep at it, but I gave up halfway, which is rare for me to do. I actually skipped the stories of two of the women - you know they are coming, and you don't care about any of them so why should you be forced to read what sad things they went through? Disappointing book."

Wow!! East of Eden was heavy for me!! Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed. The Theme: Brother vs. Brother The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on him. He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come. The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say ""History"". The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money. I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!! Overall, a great great awesome read!!"

My son tried it out first and was very impressed.  The first thing I noticed was that the lights were easy to install.  Even I could do it.!!!  I wish all items were made that easy to use.  They are well made and fit  a variety of handle bars.  The lights are very bright and that's what you want for a bike.  They have three choices of slow flash, fast flash, and a constant light..  I was very impressed and  can give a 5 star rating.  The price is good also."

My daughter and I stayed here for a getaway, and quickly were able to get to Milennium Park, shopping, Navy Pier, great dining, exploring festivals and strolling through beautiful areas along the lakefront and Chicago River. Check-in was easy and we were treated with courtesy throughout our stay. Maria, one of the concierges, was especially helpful in finding us a unique place to eat. The room was lovely and comfortable, although our tub didn't drain well. Just a wonderful stay!"

0,"The Problem: Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.  The Solution: Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.  I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.  Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.  So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable."
0,"Very disappointed in this vx-981K. I had hoped to be able to do a 4k photo burst capture-the menus in the unit are difficult to navigate and understand. The manual is awful, and can't find anything on the website to help. Very misleading as to what this can do. No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps."

0,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?  I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.  Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.  I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.  Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much.

0,"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views. All in all a good book worth reading but has to be supplemented with further readings on the post-war Soviet Union subject."

0,"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!  UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.  I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product."

It is not too long, and it is filled with good ideas, and the characters are believable.  Overall, this is a good film, and I recommend it to everyone who has seen Dracula before, and for those who have"
0,"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.  Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.  The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.  Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is."

Ailig does a good job of getting his Clan to except and trust him. In the beginning his father Neill hates the idea an does everything he can to not pass on the Cheifton to him. He seems to hate Ailig and it becomes clear why. The story held my interest. It just doesn't have much romance going on an very little sex nothing even worth mentioning. Bk. 1 and 2 just lacks that hot sexy romance story I like in the H/H. These books end abruptly for the couples. There is no epilog to let you know how the couple fared together. There are unanswered question. Such as Morainn believes she is barren. She tried to have children by her dead husband but didn't. This could have been the dead husbands fault!!

0,"Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.  One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.  UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood."

I like that the keyboard is full-size and metal backed for a sturdy feel. This keyboard is better than the Logitech K400 and way better than the Aerb ultra-thin keyboard/touchpad/remote control.

0,"After viewing ""His Last Vow,""  I am left absolutely stunned and I cannot wait to see what happens next.  I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.  The supporting cast is wonderful and I am glad that Mycroft, Molly, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson have been given more screen time."

Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.  The product description is a little strange - ""LED Incandescent"" - it's LED, not incandescent. It's also non-dimmable per the packaging."

0,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.   At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."

After the sheets were changed, I got no more bites, thankfully. Despite this, I managed to enjoy the stay. I liked the location next to the river, and the fact that it was easy to walk to Magnificent Mile."

0,"I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.  Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.  Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.  As I use the headset longer, if I find more Apps that it won't work with, I'll come back and update my review."

Now as high school is coming to a close the pair have decided to attend a party but when Vivienne separates from Ray to use the restroom their world is torn apart in an instant.  Twenty years after the massive event happened that claimed the lives of a lot of the other teens in attendance at the part Vivienne appears out of nowhere. Everyone she knew has aged even though she hasn't at all. Vivienne longs for Ray to also return but when he doesnt she dedicates her life to figuring out time travel to hopefully save Ray from whatever event had sucked her into the future.  A Betrayal of Time by Lucia Ashta is a novella length fantasy read that had a great story of lovers ripped apart but would do anything to be together again. The town thought it was an earthquake that had stolen the lives of their children until the day Vivienne appeared again. Once it was known that she wasn't the only one whos body hadnt been recovered she dedicates her life to figuring out what had happened.  While being a short read the author did a wonderful job weaving together the time travel along with letting the readers know enough about the characters to care about their outcome. This is definitely one Id recommend to the fantasy/time travel lovers out there.  I received a copy from the publisher via NetGalley."

I wish I would have gotten it a little bigger for her, because it's hard to get her to stop when I get it. I would have given it a 5 for her, but I didn't. She's a big chewer, so I wanted to give it a 5 because she's a little too big for it to stay on. I'm not sure if it's a problem with her weight, but it's not the only thing she enjoys. I haven't noticed any changes in her coat, but I have noticed a slight improvement in her eating habits.My cats love this food. My dog is about 20 lbs. and he was very picky about his food.

0,"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons: 1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do."

I liked the fact that the movie took place in the 1950s. I think that's a bit of a stretch to say that the movie takes place in the 1950s. The first time I saw this movie, I was in a different time, and it was kind of depressing. It took place in the 1950s, and it was a bit of a shock to me.

0,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss."

In trying out this cape coat, I can tell this coat is probably made based on Asian size, which means the size would be one to two sizes smaller than the US size. When I live in Taiwan, I usually wore small, and after I moved to the US, I wear x-small petite. So be aware of the size before you purchase this item. I will say go one size up if you follow the US size. For example. If you usually wear small in the US, you probably need to order a size Medium for this coat. I ordered an x-small. It fits, but the shoulder part might be a little bit tight. But I guess a small might be even better for me. The style of this cake coat is simple, cute, and elegant. It will go well with almost anything. It is light weight, and the texture is soft. It is sort of ""thin"" compared to a regular winter coat. It would be good for spring or fall l, but for winter, it will be too thin for me. The quality of the coat is ok. I won't say it is made from very good material. I can tell it might get wrinkled easily (for its thin material) if you do not fold it neatly. Overall, I like this coat. For its price, it is good enough."

0,"It should have worked, because It's a fun idea, but it falls painfully flat. It's hard to imagine Michael York as a serious seducer for one, and two, Angela Lansbury gives a performance that suggests that she is on a stage. It was a box office disaster, and you can see why. Harold Prince was a great stage director in his prime, unmatched really, but his two efforts into film, this and the appalling mess he made of 'A Little Night Music' revealed that he just didn't know what to do with the camera, or how to direct actors for film. Someone should turn it into a musical. I think it could work really work."

0,"Cons: Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it. I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable. As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc. 5 second delay to get the mouse recognized. Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect. At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver. The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button. Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.  Biggest pro: The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it. I give it 3 stars because of the software trouble and trouble getting it to install correctly. But it really is a remarkable device and it does what it sets out to do."

0,"This book was a recommendation of my reading group. Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.  I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight. The writing was good, there was NO foul language or explicit scenes. I would classify this book as a ""cozy."" And while it was good and well-written, it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, unable to put it down, so I give it four stars."
1,I put this light in a dimmer switch and it works great.  The light is pretty dim.  I had to replace a bulb that is around 30% dimmer.  The light is bright and the color is quite a bit warmer.  I use it in a dimmer switch to light up my room and it has a very warm light.

1,"Toy manufacturers seem to churn out more and more wooden trains for the kids, and this one has been a hit.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the train is very sturdy.

The carriage is very sturdy, and very simple to use.  The carriage is very simple to use, and very simple to use.  The train is very simple to use, and very simple to use.

0,"Perhaps it was bad luck for V. Hislop that I came to this book immediately after Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue - now there's someone whose characters zing off the page, from whose pen flows effortlessly great prose and who can put together a damned good story. None of  which, sadly, applies to Ms Hislop. OK, so I might have been dazzled by Telegraph Avenue, but I think that even if I'd read The Thread close on the heels of say, a thoroughgoing perusal of the phone book, the latter would shine by comparison. I think that Ms Hislop intended The Thread to be a peon to Thessaloniki which is, I'll grant her, a great little city. But it never comes to life; if there is such a thing a taxidermic prose, Ms Hislop can do it. Poor old Thessaloniki is just a one-dimensional sketch under her hand, a stage set about which she poses a cast of cliched cardboard cutouts (the Nazi's mouth is 'thin' - aren't they always? - the protagonist's bad husband is fat and smelly; the university students are all intellectual firebrands. Etc etc). There are far better books than this about this area and this period. For example, anyone who wants a great fictional account of the sack of Smyrna should read Jerusalem Poker (Edward Whittemore), or Middlesex (Jeffrey Eugenides) or Birds without Wings (Louis de Berniers) while Alan Furst's Spies of the Balkans brings pre-war and wartime Thessaloniki beautifully alive in a way that Ms Hislop could only dream about. Don't waste your time with this book. Read something good."

0,"I owned a couple of other trail running shoes before, but got to say this is the most high tech one.  What interests me about these shoes are the fact they are as comfortable as tennis or running shoe.  Two, I live in the Northwest and at time do wondering into the forest now and then.  What actually caught my eye was the nifty color scheme orange and black then the cable shoe laces.  This looks good, I seen a NorthFace with the twist lock, but that is bulky.  I never own Salomon's shoe before, but do own some of their snowboarding equipments and got to say they are a specialty company.  Features: Well I am using this in the snow for the time being because it is gore-tex to keep out the water.

The Teva's rubber sole grip on the bottom is already worn down in less the half a year.  I hope this ""Contagrip"" last a little longer.  Both have OrthoLite insole.

0,"Note that ""adjustable"" means the fit, using hook-and-loop closures, onto the body part.  These are not the type of weights which allow addition and removal of sandbags to adjust the weight. The outside is a lycra-type material, making the weights comfortable against the skin.  They stay on well--I use them for ankles--but are easy to get on and off.  If your exercise or physical therapy routine requires quick change of weights, I recommend these.  Switching these off with a 2-1/2 pound pair easier than adding and removing sandbags in the truly ""adjustable"" set I own."

Clean up is super easy because almost no crumbs or residue from the cake remain in the pan. The cake did pop right out without it sticking to the inside. The instructions do say to bake with the pan placed on top of a cookie sheet. Great for a party as a way to showcase a cake.

1,"Since I just recently purchased this lens, I noticed a few things.  First, the lens is so small that it's not easy to get around. This is a very large lens with a small lens hood.  Second, it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a huge difference between a medium-sized lens and a compact one.  Third, the lens has a VERY weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm forced to hold it just a little too tightly.  Fourth, the lens is a bit too big. It's a bit too large for my hand and I'm forced to hold it too close to my eye.  Fifth, the lens is too small. I have no idea how long this will last. I'll have to buy a bigger lens to replace it.  Finally, the lens has a very weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm"

We used it for making homemade bread for two people.  We used it as a quick and easy way to make homemade bread for several people.  We made a lot of homemade bread and it was pretty easy.  I like that the bread is thick and it holds a lot of flour, so it's easy to make for our dinner guests.  We also used it to make a pasta dish for two people.  This is a very handy feature.  I like that it's a small and easy to carry to the counter to store for later use.  I also like that the bag holds a lot of flour so you don't have to worry about it spilling out the bag.  I also like that it doesn't come with a lid.  It's a little awkward to use but it works great for our needs.
