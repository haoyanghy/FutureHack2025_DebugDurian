1,"When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago, I immediately went to their website to check them out. What I found there was decent, nothing really stood out. It wasn't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened. The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional. Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly. The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day. When I asked about more towels, the maids were happy to help me out. If I were ever to be in that area again, I know exactly where I'm staying, the Swissotel."

0,"We were feeding this to our two puppies (Goldens) for the past 7 months. At first they seemed to like it okay and then all of the sudden the last bag of food they weren't interested in it at all. Matter of fact, as hungry as they were, they would leave their entire bowl of food, untouched all day long. Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review. So if your dog's refusing to eat or only nibbling at their bowl of TOTW and have loose stool or diarrhea, you may want to think about changing foods. Look up the consumer complaints yourself."
0,"This movie is wonderful with a touch of cheesiness I look for in movies of this genre.  The child actors are much more disturbing than the movie itself, but that has to be seen to be believed..."
0,"These are good at creating bubbles. However, they start ""shedding"" with moderate use and cleaning. My hydroponic reservoir had a little bit of algae in it, so I needed to clean the airstone as well. Bits and pieces kept coming off of it. After the cleaning, I noticed bits of the airstone falling off into the reservoir every day.  Considering these are less than a dollar each, it's not the worst thing in the world. However, I really would prefer they didn't ""shed"" into my tank."
0,"This is not a movie I ever think about when I'm looking for something to watch, but over the years I've watched it two or three times and I always enjoy it. There's nothing outstanding about it; it's not a unique plot, the acting is so-so - but for some reason none of that hurts it's watchability. It's just a good movie."
1,"This was an interesting story, but the characters were just too real. There were too many of the same clichs that I've seen before. The characters were just so real, and that made it difficult to put them down.I enjoyed this book. I don't know how I would recommend it to anyone but I will say that I had to wait a bit for the second book. I just didn't care for it as much as the first one. It's very sad that this book is ending. I hope the series continues.I loved this book"

0,"The sock, underwear and other drawer are great. The bra holder is good but not for larger cup sizes."
0,"PROS: 1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks. CONS: 1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly. 2. Runs very hot and noisy. 3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily. TIPS: 1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time. 2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment."

0,"Since we can never have enough umbrellas, I was pleased for the chance to try out the TravelZen umbrella in exchange for my review. {I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion. I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}  This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car."

0,"I'm in a new house, and trying to keep to my resolutions of being organized. You know all those little things you have around the house? In the bathroom, the office, the kitchen? This, and the other sizes, are all great for corralling them up and keeping them from looking junky.  I'm using one of these to keep my diabetes equipment - testing, syringes, etc. Before, I kept them in an old tupperware, and they'd always get jumbled up in the bottom. Now my syringes are standing up, my oral meds are in a slot, and the whole thing slides neatly into a cabinet.  I've got one in my office, too, holding all the things that aren't pens - little styluses, nail files, computer screwdrivers, etc. In my bathroom, one's holding tweezers, manicure scissors and little samples of perfume in 1 cubby.  The nice thing is, even though I have 2 of them tucked into cabinets, they're good looking enough that I don't mind keeping them on a counter or desk."
0,I commute to work and this is the best light I have ever owned.  The high beam seems more than enough for me to ride a paved forest preserve trail in the pitch black.

0,"Bruce Willis did his best work here and the rest of the cast was excellent as well. As good as this film is, it's unfortunate that all M. Night's subsequent work was unfavorably compared to it.  I can recommend ""Unbreakable""(also starring Willis) as the same kind of mystery with a ""drop jaw"" ending."

With its neo-classical stylings and its non-classical service, it is just a combination for trouble, We had established our reservations for Friday the 15th amd arrived at 4pm to check-in. No Room. One hour after their posted check in time and nothing. No apology, no offer for upgrade, no discount. Nothing. As a seasoned traveler I have had my share of disappointments but this tops the list."

0,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew's birthday and it was a hit. He especially loves the way it changes his voice. It is not always clear, but still is a lot of fun. The prerecorded phrases and ""breathing"" sound are very realistic. It came with demo batteries, but they did not work, so we had to take it out of the package and put new batteries in it. The instructions consist of pictures only, so it was a little confusing as to where the batteries go. We actually took the wrong cover off (it was the forehead pad) thinking the batteries were under it, and it broke in the process, but it was easily glued back on. As with any electronic toy for a 6 year old, I'm not sure how long this will hold up, but so far, he loves it."

I also love it for the whole family.  I'm not sure if it is a comedy or a film for older kids, but I think it's an adult movie.  It's very touching.  I highly recommend this movie.I thought this was going to be one of the best shows ever made.  The acting was superb, the direction was perfect, and the production values were top notch.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has never seen or heard of the show.  If you're a fan of the show, then this is the show for you.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.This is a movie that I enjoyed watching over and over."

0,"I bought this to use in transferring data among my various netbooks, laptops and desktop computers I have at home and in my workshop. Seemed to perform just fine when connected directly to onboard USB ports, but very, very sensitive to being connected via powered USB hubs. With one system (WinXP home with a powered USB hub) it totally took down the USB bus as long as it was plugged in - not good at all.  So - seems OK as long as you're not using a USB hub. But unfortunately it's a pain for me to disconnect something else in order for me to plug directly into an onboard USB port on the one system."

0,"I love Elizabeth Berg's writing. That being said, I did not like this book. Probably because the more I read of George Sand, the less I cared about her. Actually that's not quite right, as by the end of the book, I really detested her. She might have been a brilliant writer, but seemed to me to have the morals of an alley cat, a narcissistic one at that, going from one lover to another. Who cares is she was philosophical about it."
1,"Ok, first and foremost, I wanted a professional quality finish. I chose this for my application as it is a two-piece tool. The tool is designed to be a two-piece tool that is not designed to be a two-piece tool. If you are looking for a professional quality tool, this is the tool for you. I have had many jobs where I have had to replace a tool that has had to be replaced for many years.  However, when I got this tool, I wanted to be able to change out a tool that has had to be replaced for many years and I had to replace it for that reason. I don't want to have to replace a tool that I have used and to have to replace it for years to come. I like the fact that I can change out a tool with no hassle.  The tool is a very good quality and I was very impressed with the tool. I will be purchasing a second set of these for my office and they are going to be worth every penny.  UPDATE: I have replaced the tool with this tool and have had no problems. The tool is now a very good quality tool. I have replaced my tool with this tool and have had no problems. I have also used this tool and it has helped me tremendously"

0,"`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.  The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.  I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.  The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting."

0,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.  First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one: Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.  Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.  The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.  This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.  The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."

They were easy to install and when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blum-Universal-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B002K9TAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blum Universal Mounting Bracket</a>&nbsp;i was easily able to mount them to the base of my 1\2 plywood shelves. The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.  Pro's  100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them  Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes  Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go  Con's  If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out  Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level  Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot  Conclusion For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price."

0,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.  I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."

0,"This is a valuable book for our generation, and I wished it has a more populist version.  It's a textbook for Stanford engineering and senior science students.  Much of it is readable by anyone with basic science courses; but remember reading your first year's physics books, the ones with physics problems at the end?  Take this up another notch, with requiring completion of second year math.  My peers went on to highly successful careers in engineering and sciences; I transferred to a liberal arts school.  I'm always highly suspicious of math equations to explain lots of things, and find this slows readings quite a bit.  But, if you happen to enjoy wading through a few math equations, this is an excellent comprehensive introduction to renewal  energy.  Its writing style is outstanding as well."

0,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man... Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey. While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books. By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."

He's not a very playful dog, he won't taste the ball he won't play with toys.

I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.  I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.  I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.  I fell completely in love with the concept of snow globe moments. It reminds you to always be present in the experiences while you're in them and to always look for adventure and joy."

0,"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.  It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.  Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I. Go get one today!"
0,"We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three generation 'girls weekend' (Grandma, mom and daughter). I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece. Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. The American Girl package was perfect for us. My 8 year old daughter was thrilled. They give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. Our room, 1334, was large and clean. It had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. The employees are all very friendly and helpful. We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there. We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast. This hotel is north of Michigan Ave. But it is just a short, pleasant walk to the Mag. Mile. I would definately stay here again in Chicago."

They are the most comfortable I have ever worn and I am so happy with them. I recommend them to anyone looking for a glove that will last a long time. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend these gloves to anyone looking for a great glove. These are super lightweight and lightweight. I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality product. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding. My only complaint is that I haven't used them yet, but they are very well made and have been used in my gym."

0,"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.   Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.   Wonderboys will especially be appreciated by anyone who is a writer. The film will leave you with a thoughtful smile."

0,"These are great for a 4 year old who likes to build!  The packaging is a little disappointing, as it is a cardboard box with a plastic cover.  This does not create the type of seal I would prefer for a toy with many small parts.  The pieces themselves are occasionally tough for a child to fit together snugly.  The choices in this set are fun and clearly created for a girl, and they have instructions on how to create several options in the box that are easy to follow. Overall this is a solid set if you have a girl who likes building and who enjoys pretend play, as it allows you to create a princess and some animal friends to play within the built structures."

Great characters people the book,  the writing is terrific, the (...) scenes are tastefully done, and the adventure is a grand one.

0,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

0,"This is a cute idea, but it's not all that much fun. After the novelty wears off, there's not much to it. This is a miniature race track with these cars that you charge up, then let zoom around for a few laps.  It's kind of neat.  These teeny tiny cars - seriously there are as big as my thumbnail, have batteries and motors in them.  The set needs two double-A batteries to work; and you ""charge"" up the little car, then let it go flying around the track.  It's a little klunky, but kind of neat. Once the track is set, you place the car in the charging area and press a lever.  The lever sticks these two prongs into the back of the car.  The back of the car has 2 little metal pieces where the contact is made to charge the car.  Mine didn't work.  I had to fiddle with the wires in the back of the car but finally I was able to make contact.  When the car charges, it makes a little revving noise which is kind of neat.  Then you release the car, and it zooms around the track a few times.  It's cute.  It's also boring.  The novelty of one car wears off quickly.  This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it's not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It's pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could ""race"" them etc, but alone, it's pretty dry stuff. My nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.  At least it doesn't take up much space."

0,"My father read this book to me the first year it was published. I was nine and it has been on my bookshelf since. I can't tell you how many copies of this I have purchased for people. This is a great book to encourage thinking, not simply memorizing. Each page contains new language, new ideas, new ways to play with learning. It also happens to be a wonderful story. I may have been too young at nine to read it on my own, but certainly it is a great read-aloud for children nine or a bit younger. At nine, I didn't understand all the fancies, but like the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland, this book succeeds on many levels. The Phantom Tollbooth encourages a child's love for language. It paints wonderful pictures (with the help of Feiffer's charming line drawings). It is as perfect a thing as can be written. Oh, and if you're an adult without any children at home - buy the book for yourself. It will take you away from the Doldrums and into the Kingdom of Wisdom where your spirit can be renewed."

0,"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that."

They do not retract inside the robot and instead stick out. It's not a big deal. The robot is about 10"" tall, but you can raise the head to make it about 11"".  The robot includes 3 cheap AAA trial batteries. I immediately replaced them with Alkalines. They are accessed from the bottom of the robot, and a screwdriver is required.  The power switch is also on the bottom. Options are: Off, Play, and Trial. Dialogue is triggered by pushing the robot's power pack on the side. Push it once, and it says one the robot's popular phrases. Hold the button for a few seconds, and it will go thru all the robot's dialogue. If I counted correctly, there are 15 phrases.  The LED lights look very cool.  All around, I like this little robot.

1,"I use cast iron pans, and I am very pleased with this pan.  I have used it twice and am very happy with it.  The pan is a bit thinner than some of the other cast iron pans I have owned, but it is still very sturdy.  The handle is a bit too small for a single person, but the pan holds up well for me.  I have had no problems with it, although it is still very heavy.  I would recommend this pan for anyone who is looking for a pan that will hold up to heavy usage, or just someone who is looking for a pan that is easy to clean, but doesn't have a lot of storage space.  I'm very happy with my purchase.

1,I've read a lot of books by the author and this one is by far my favorite.  The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the author is very clear that it's a little different in the way she chooses to deal with her own issues.  The book is a bit slow at times and it's a bit hard to follow at times as you're trying to figure out who the main character is and who they are.  It's very refreshing to have a book that is written in the style of a book that is written with a great feel for a story.  I especially like the way the author describes the characters and the theme of the story.  I really liked the way the author gave us an idea of who

It could be either the reason why my cat first willingly got on it after 3 weeks. And albeit on my bed, it's now still competing with my pillow and comforter and my face for my cat's butt. The power is really low. Covering a comforter on it all day cannot raise the temperature for me to feel very warm so I doubt it makes a difference for cats who have higher body temperature than human"

1,"OMG, First reason why I chose this style is because it is a nice fit for a person with a narrow foot.  The front of the shoe is slightly wider than the back, so that it is a little smaller in the heel.  The front is very soft and gives good support.  The straps are very comfortable and the material is very soft and soft.  The color is very nice and the material is very comfortable.  The only reason I didn't buy this style was because it is very short for a woman, but I am glad I did.  I am usually a size 6, but ordered a medium.  The length is perfect.  The fabric is soft, but the color is very bright and vivid.  It is a cute color to wear for a costume.  I wish it had the support that I need.

0,"This book is different from any story I ever read. While it starts as a regular suspense, it soon turns into a grabbing thriller where the emotion and suspense escalate with every page. I had trouble putting it down as I followed the tribulations of the heroine Dorrie. Morgan Mandel does a great job at keeping us turning the pages as we discover Dorrie's problems and wonder how she will react. The villains are great too, each with a convincing motivation to explain their actions. This is the first book in a series and we can't wait for the others."

My beagle pup has loved this since the day she joined our household at eight weeks.  The other dogs have enjoyed the larger sizes all their lives, but this one is just the right size for  my Buffy.  It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat.  She will work on it to get the food out.  When she gives up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher.  Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight.  It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.  Again, this will make life a bit more interesting for them.  I highly recommend!  This arrived well before before expected."

0,"My cats loved this product. I used Instinct food for them prior to starting to make my own food two years ago. Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients. If you use this product, Keep a close watch on your kittie's chin!!"

0,"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.  Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.  Would I recommend this cage?  Yes, I may even buy another one for ""cat tree"" use myself if they bring the white one back into stock -- cages in the livingroom are not exactly ""high design"" -- I'd like them to at least match."
0,"I struggled through this book because it was so highly rated; I kept reading because I thought I would eventually figure out what was so special about it.  But I never did.

Adam is so passionate and such a dominant that he protects all the women in his life. All the women he cares about. And he doesn't take no for an answer. I had to write the author and tell her that I'm so excited for the very next book. At the very end of Adam, enough said, I hope that the two people that are discussed at the party are the next book I think that would be absolutely wonderful.  Summertimes over so I won't call this a beach read. I would say this book is definitely one that you could curl up with a nice blanket some hot chocolate, apple cider, or smooth Scotch and enjoy the read."

The author has a good history of how the USA was one of the worst countries in the world, and the details of the military operations of the USA during World War II are excellent.  I was especially interested in the author's account of the events of the invasion of Normandy. I found it fascinating and enlightening. I think the author's narrative style is quite believable and I highly recommend it to any military or civilian reader.This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a book that you should read.This is a very good book. I like the fact that I don't have to deal with the emotional side of the story.  It has a good story, but I have to deal with the book.

0,"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.  I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.  Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens."

1,I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago. I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again.

0,"When I selected this Barbie doll and horse play set (based on the upcoming movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-Her-Sisters-in-A-Pony-Tale/dp/B00E95AEBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale</a>) to try, I didn't realize it was remote controlled (it appears to be the only Barbie horse so controlled so far), so this function came as a complete surprise, and once I figured out that it needed 4 AAA batteries not 2 (mentioned on the box of course but surprisingly not obvious in the battery installation instructions), it functioned exactly as it was supposed to.  Controlled either by the Barbie doll remote control or by forehead button when Barbie is riding (though depending on the play area you might be able to bounce Barbie's arm activated infrared signal off the wall and make it work that way), the horse walks, stops, bows, and recovers from the bow as intended.  In our experience the horse walking worked well on smooth flooring and thin carpeting, but not (obviously IMHO) on thick carpeting.  Restarting the horse after it enters sleep mode is a little tedious (holding the button down until something happens) but better than the alternative of running the batteries down.  I can see some definite additional play possibilities if and when they start making more of these remote control horses, especially if they speed them up a bit and add unicorns so that they can be made to ram into each other.  (When I mentioned this to my 9-year-old daughter, she raised an eyebrow, folded her arms, and said, ""Daddy...."", then picked up the horse and stalked off.)  Maybe it's another one of those differences between boys and girls things.  Note: This play set is one way to (start) acquiring horses and dolls for the otherwise horseless and doll-less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-and-Her-Sisters-in-a-Pony-Tale-RV-Vehicle/dp/B00C6PV4QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale RV Vehicle</a>, another remarkable toy in this line."
0,"In a world of Elena's, Sookie's, Bella's and Buffy's it is refreshing to have a somewhat campy novel about vampires that isn't all blood and lust.  Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.  This story really reminds me of the early Queen Betsy books - you know the GOOD ones - and is a funny yet engaging tale that kept me entertained the entire read.  I really hope that this turns into a series as Queen Betsy should just be staked already and I'm looking for a new fun series to take its place."

0,"Suze is now working at a resort this summer as a babysitter to eight year old Jack Slater. He is really shy until Suze teaches him about what he is, a mediator. His hot older brother Paul is Suze's age, and he keeps pestering Suze into going out with him. Of course, she doesnt want to because she is falling in love with Jesse, even though he is dead and they can't be together. At home her step dad and step brother are digging in the back yard to install a hot tub. During the night, another ghost yet again, wakes her up. This time it's not a ghost seeking her help, it's a ghost threatening that the digging stop or she'll kill Suze. This ghost was Jesse's fiance, who he was on his way to marry when he died, and Suze believes she knows why this ghost wants the digging to end. To find out what happens read it!

The material is very light, and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had it in a while, but I'm sure I'll be getting it in the next couple of weeks.

0,"This is the best book I've read in 2017 -- funny, sad, entertaining, totally satisfying, At the end (a denouement I never expected), I wanted to turn back and read it again to watch for the preparation and clues Towles had scattered throughout.  What's to be said about a book in which the protagonist (a Former Person to the Bolsheviks, Count Rostov to his friends) is under house arrest in a Moscow hotel for 40 years, Nikita Khrushchev plays a very small part, and New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury's overcoat is crucial to the way it all works out?  But the plot isn't the best part -- it is Towles' light-hearted prose style. Though he doesn't let the reader forget the horrors that were occurring outside -- massive starvation, five-year plans that didn't work, World War II -- what is important here is one man's mastery of his circumstances."

0,"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable. For now I will keep looking for a similar product but with better workmanship. Fail."

I ended up suggesting the Hotel Restaurant for my interview and they took such a good care of us, they made me feel so comfortable that I was hardly nervous at all. And the place was pack! The room was superb! Really cool design . I had a room they call an apartment, and it was fantastic! The natural light you get in this room is awesome, and I am very sensitive to dark places. They have a full bar in the room , which I was able to use to entertain my friends that night. I went to the gym for a little bit of exercise and I have to say I have never seen such a extensive facility in a hotel. All the staff made me feel like I was family.

0,"INSTALLATION TIPS: 1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later. 2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.  BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.  BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious."

I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!"

0,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.  The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.  Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!  Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review."

1,My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back. The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either. When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key. When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made. The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food. We ended up going home two days before we planned.

0,This book is a classic for a reason. Jane is a heroine the reader can embrace.  The writing is flawless; Charlotte Bronte can evoke such genuine emotion.  If you want a book that you can immerse yourself in this is it.  I'm not one to re-read a book after I've already read it but Jane Eyre is one of my few exceptions.  This book should be in every library.
0,"My husband is just under 6' and wears a 34 pant and a medium jacket; the large was quite a bit too small. It ripped out immediately, so he removed the feet to give him extra room. The quality was such that we immediately ordered the XL. So except for size, I would recommend this for light-duty work. Our purpose was to work in a damp crawl space."
0,I received a copy of this book in exchange for a review. There is so much emotional upheaval in this last book. Cassie having to deal with the ramifications of her assault and Cody's reaction that results with him being temporarily separated from her. Rather unjustly but when has anything ever been easy for these two.  How their love is the only thing gives them the strength they need to deal with the difficult times. Willa-Mae and Mike providing them with the space and support they both needed. Inspiring. A large box of tissues is a must have before you sit down to read this last installment. You will not be disappointed. Look forward to reading more stories from L.G. Castillo.

1,"I was in business in Chicago, so I decided to choose what I thought would be a relaxing hotel to treat myself a bit. I should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when I asked for some of the complimentary apple cider advertised. She told me, 'It's by the signs' in a 'you-idiot' kind of voice. Too bad the signs were too far away from me to read without my glasses! I was ashamed and did not ask for anything from the front desk again. The room itself was horribly decorated and nothing special. The 'I'm too ugly to steal' furniture patterns and colors did not say 'luxury' to me! I went down to relax by the pool with my laptop, to get some work done. Unfortunately, the pool was overrun with about five rowdy kids. No parents in sight. I would have reported them to the front desk, but was shamed by the aforementioned apple cider incident. Thank God I left my laptop in its case, or it would have been ruined by all of the water that was splashed on me! The 'free breakfast' tasted like cardboard; it was something akin to a free breakfast at a $60-a-night hotel. I only tried it once because it made me feel sick when I ate it. The only good thing about my experience was leaving this overpriced motel behind to go to work!"

I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers. I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book! Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!! I will however read Darius and Taylor's story."

0,"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone. Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome. The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo. The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive. I enjoyed the film and the theme.  It held my interest and kept me watching."
0,"Swissotel continues to be a *yawn* As previous posters state, punching in your floor is ridiculous. On the other hand, technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators (but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me, why change)? In any case, I want to take a nice hot soak and--guess what--they are having water problems... SOOOOO disappointed. Hopefully I don't get bug bitten this time (checked under the sheets). Sadly, due to my company's deal, I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh*...but so far they are batting 1 star.... -------------- Oh boy, it must be my luck...or rather this hotel is just run down. I had to swap room FOUR TIMES. And that's for a Thurs nite-Sunday morning stay. My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms. They gave me the key to the 2nd room, which happened to be occupied. Luckily the occupants had their security latch on, so there wasn't any embarrassing moment. My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today (just now) I had to move because of water leakage (above my room and below my room). BOY, talk about an awful hotel (or my just awful luck???? Maybe it's karma since I wrote a bad review last year, and continue to write one...but it's the TRUTH). Oh, also last year may not have been bed bugs. I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg. Perhaps it is something in the sheets...or the air/HVAC.... in any case, despite the decent staff, it is a ONE at best (0 for hotel, 1 for the still nice service--since it's not their fault....)

Winters has done an amazing job in writing this series so far.  The second book picks up exactly where the first leaves off Allison is going through a rough time now that she has lost her job and she believes that Cooper was behind it all along. This book you will really find that you will have a love hate relationship with Cooper while he is absolutely charming and sweeps Allison off of her feet at times he also acts like a complete and total jerk during others, so in other words a complete and total alpha male (sinfully delicious yes please!). This book leaves you will a lot of questions at the end like whether or not this is going to work out for Allison and Cooper. Will he be able to change his ways? Will Allison finally be able to catch a break?  K.B. Winters did such a fantastic job writing this book it was full of drama, suspense, action and some hot and steamy sex scenes the chemistry between Allison and Cooper in this book is so great it just grabs you and makes you feel like you are right there along for the ride with them. She does such a great job of bringing the reader along and making them feel like they are a part of they story.  Fantastic job! I cannot wait to see what the final book reveals!"
0,"Following in the footsteps of the first book in the series, Marine for Hire, this delightful story treats us to Mac and Kelli. Mac is a security expert, ex-military, who needs a fiancee quickly as cover in his negotiations for an arms deal that is about to go down. Kelli is his sister's best friend, someone he vaguely remembers as a cute pig-tailed girl, but who will do in a pinch. Imagine his surprise when this vivacious gorgeous woman (who unbeknownst to him has had a crush on him for years) shows up for duty. The question is whether Mac will let the temporary arrangement they have turn into something more. I loved this story! Kelli is such a fun character - feisty, flirty, full of life. She has loved Mac from afar for so long, and now has the perfect opportunity to seduce him into bed and hopefully ingrain herself a little bit into his heart. Mac is also wonderfully written as a strong, handsome confident man, stoic on the outside but holding in strong passions on the inside. He feels that it's his duty to protect those around him and getting involved with a woman is too distracting. But Kelli is such a delicious distraction that he is willing to let down his guard just a little - long enough for her to get into his bed, and maybe a little corner of his heart as well. The sexual attraction between them sizzles and the love scenes are steamy and well written. Along with the relationship plot however is some suspense and action as well as Mac's job takes them into dangerous territory. In addition moments of humour abound, making the reader laugh out loud many times at the crazy antics that ensue. Secondary characters play important roles in the plot as well, mostly Mac's family as the relationship between Mac and Kelli develops. This was a fun, steamy, heartwarming read with laughs, tears and all emotions in between."

0,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."
0,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.  With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.  Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.  I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have."

0,"My 12 year old sheltie has bad hips, which I guess is common for his age and breed.  Before a vet recommended this product, we were helping our dog stand up after laying down for too long, and my husband had to carry him up and down stairs in order to go outside.  This was three years ago, and I was sure it was about time to put him down.  He's a little slow going up and down stairs, but he does it on his own now.  He gets up and down on his own and follows me around just like he did when he was a puppy.  He's a happy dog and still as loveable as always.  If we accidentally run out of Nutramax Cosequin DS, he starts to limp and slow down within a week.  This has truly been amazing .. I wish they made something that worked this well for humans."
0,"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.  Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering: Power: 700 Watt Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208 No audible alarm for any events.  After all, I am happy with the pot for the price and the build quality.

He has never had a problem with it, but he is definitely enjoying it!  We've put it together over a year and he still enjoys it and we're using it for his ""gift"" to his brother.  He was able to play with it for almost an hour with no issues.  It's still pretty cute, but not as durable as the older ones I've had.  My only complaint is that the handle is kind of loose.  I was very disappointed with the way the handle broke off.  I would have given it a star if the handle had been more sturdy and I could have fixed it without the handle.  I was worried about the stability of the handle being loose, but it's a small plastic that will hold together well enough and it's durable enough.  It comes with a nice variety of accessories for him to use with it, like a piano and a dartboard and a toy kitchen.

0,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.  This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.  Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.  I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.  This one had action, forbidden romance and a lot of fun moments. One of Georgettes best books in my opinion and I definitely recommend to fans of paranormal romance."

0,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.  After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.  Simple Maintenance is key:  If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it. If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)  My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.  It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.  Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars."

0,"This is a remarkable documentary, not for any other reason than it's indomitably spirited lead.  Yes, Tammy Faye is a cartoon, a travesty of taste (on the dvd it is easy to focus on her fashion, we kept going back to some sort of hat that looked like she was a huge, religious, heavily made up insect....antennae and all.)  But like all good documentaries, it respects it's subject in a way that you come from it with much love and appreciation.  The dvd has no special stuff but the documentary alone has enough for cult viewers, pop culturists and voyeurs to obsess over for months.  There are puppets(religious puppets that they formed from porky pig heads), there is Jesus as Joy, lots of singing, Jerry Falwell(if you never hated him before, you will now) riding down a water slide, narration by a sedated RuPaul...but under all the incredible tack, Tammy Faye emerges as an amazingly passionate, forgiving non judgemental human being.  Her stand considering gay christians and christians with aids is almost revolutionary.  .......also there is a speech she gives at the end, when doing a sermon, which is inspired and forgiving.  It gives you a very different perspective on the permanantly made up miracle maven......This is a documentary that stays with you, respectful, kitschy(love the jim j and tammy faye show), informative and at times confrontative, this is a really fun watch.  You will end up liking Tammy Faye a little more than you expected..."

When I went to check in I was told I didn't have a reservation, knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working. Finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. Thankfully they knew how to use the computer. I go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. I could not believe it when I complained, I was told to spray some air freshener. I had to go visit family. When I got back my room key did not work. Once again there I was complaining to the helpless employee. He told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. I could not believe the mentality of this guy.

0,"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.  That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.  Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.  I've brought it in the shower and into a swimming pool with me and had no problems, so it seems great for water sports and activities."

There were some things I didn't like, and that made it a little difficult to understand. I had to read it to understand how it all came together. This book is a must read for any young adult. I would recommend it to anyone who is into young adult fiction. I absolutely loved this book. I was just so excited to read it and read it again. It was a wonderful story. It is filled with characters that are likable and I enjoyed the way they connected to each other. I had a hard time putting it down. It was a story that I will never forget. I loved the way the story was told. I will miss the author. I will miss the author. I love this series and am looking forward to seeing where the next book comes from. I am always a fan of Julie Kingsolver's writing, and I was very impressed with this book. It was well written, and I was able to relate to the main character, who was a very good character, and the relationship between her and her father. I think this book was a great addition to a series that is often referred to as a ""coming of age"" book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys family, mystery, mystery, romance, and historical fiction."

For the price,  this was better than I expected.  You do  get what you pay for though.  The inside feels and looks very cheap and I don't love the feel of the strap.  I took no points off for these issues because they are minor and if I expected a higher quality I should pay more.  This purse was exactly as described and perfect for me.  I would definitely recommend it and when it wears out I will probably buy another."
0,"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people."

I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.

0,"I almost gave it only 3 stars. But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars. I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down. It will not last much longer. I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam. Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.  With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it. I've had it for about 3 weeks now. My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely. I was worried that I might be turning diabetic. A checkup confirmed that I wasn't. The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.  It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it. But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's. Anyone younger should should have an easier time getting used to it.  Using a piece of good firm memory foam on the knee board should make this an excellent kneeling chair."

1,"In terms of concept - this is the only food I've tried that my dog doesn't eat.  I had to get a rawhide and the flavor was not great.I have a dog that likes to be outside in the yard.  This was perfect for him.  He gets a lot of exercise, and it has a great smell and it is a great way to get him to get used to the outside.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too big for him, but he does love it and it fits perfectly in the front door.  I am glad I bought it because it is too big for him to get used to.  I'm sure I will purchase another one in the future.I like the fact that it comes with a variety of different colors. I have a 10 year old Lab and he loves this.My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. She loves to play with it and I thought it would be a good toy for her. The size fits her and I can't see her getting upset or pulling at it.

So for us, it is a sometimes treat vs the pork chomp sticks which she enjoys weekly."

0,"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!  I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.  They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.  I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.  I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.  A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.  I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time."

0,"There is no more imoortant job than being a stay at home mom (or dad). And this book reads like talking to a wise and supportive friend. In Stay At Home Mom: Lousy Pay, Lousy Hours, Priceless Rewards, Ali Bierman tells sweet stories about raising her kids, as a stay at home mom, throws in some profound quotes and most important, packs the book with useful real world tips. She is a very creative person and uses that to channel love into her kids and teach us new ways to do the same. There are also surprises and gifts from the author! But my favorite part was finding out how her kids turned out when they grew up. Highly recommended to any parent (even if you cant find a way to stay at home). 5-stars."

1,"The Good:  The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:  The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version. I'm glad I found this review helpful. It helps me to make my own decisions. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. Very good quality. Very good for the price. very goodI love this little bag. I have a small kitchen and my bag keeps food from drying out. It fits perfect in the refrigerator and I love that it has a little plastic underneath. My only problem is that the bag is about 2"" wide. I wish I had seen that much larger bag when I got it. I purchased this for my daughter's wedding and she loved it. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it is perfect for her room. It is very soft and perfect for her small room. I bought 2 sets of this for her room and I love them. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful."

I will update the review after I see some changes.I use this to give my dog a massage as it is very gentle on her.

0,"Laurel Hawthorne is a woman with secrets, which she believed she'd left behind when she married David and moved into a posh gated community. Until, that is, the night that their daughter's friend drowned in the Hawthornes' pool, a terrible event that put a huge crack in Laurel's carefully maintained facade. The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a riveting, Southern gothic, family drama, driven by the skeletons in Laurel's closet, her fear for her own daughter, and her love-hate relationship with her glamorous older sister, Thalia. Did someone cause Mollie's drowning? Was it an accident or a murder? What does daughter Shelby know that she isn't telling? Does David have a mistress? Do ghosts really appear to Laurel? And, underlying all these foreboding questions is an even darker one, about a death that occurred during her childhood.  The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a real page turner, from the first to the final chapters."

1,"I purchased this at a discount on Amazon. com. I will update this review if I find a cheaper price. The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The bulb is not in the same position as the rest of the bulbs. The light is not a very bright white, and it has a very low output (just a single beam). I was hoping that the bulb would be brighter, but it is not. The bulb is not very bright, but I have no doubt that it will last for years, and is still a great value. It is a great value for a good price. This is a very good lamp. I like the fact that it does not have a ""lock"" which means that it can be turned off with the ""lock"" button. I have no idea how to turn it off without this lock, but it does not have the lock button as it is in the picture. I bought a new set and this is the only one I have. I use it to go to the bathroom when I am away from the house. It is a nice lamp that does not turn on when it is dark. It is not the best lamp I have ever owned, but it is perfect. I will buy more of this lamp in the future. This is a good product. I am very happy with the quality of the product. I use it for reading in a dimmer. I have purchased two more for my son's room, one for a bedroom and one for a bathroom. The one that I use is a standard, incandescent light."

0,"This bag is working out perfectly for my wife in her new job. She never removes it from the wheels as it takes a couple minutes to convert over and isn't really hard to shoulder carry with the wheels. Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it. She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this."

I finally got the book and am glad I did. Simmons took plenty of shots at Kareem, but, ultimately gave him a 3rd best player ever rating. At the beginning of the book, Simmons went into great detail as to why he says Bill Russell was a greater player than Wilt, and his arguments and historical proof of his opinion was so accurate that I have to change my own opinion ad go over to the Sports Guys side-Russ was better than Wilt. His rating of Kobe at only the 15th best player ever was ridiculous. With Kobe`s 4th ring won in 2009 (without Shaq to you Kobe haters) was the final hurdle he had to get over to be rated as one of the top 7 or 8 players ever. West and Oscar won one championship each, Wilt and Kareem were the MVP`s on the teams that they did win their one ring on, and Kobe has won 4 and, yet, Simmons rates him behind both of them? Laughable. No sport places a higher premium on the all time status of players being based on championships won than pro basketball. With that truth, Bird with 3 rings, rated way higher than Kobe with his 4. Well, thats just the Celtic bias coming through since Simmons makes quite clear he thinks the sun sets on Bird`s rear end. Oh well, basically the book was fair, it was funny , it was worth 700 pages and would be a nice addition to any basketball fans library."

0,"An engrossing YA sci-fi thriller. The story centers around a group of teenagers who live in a small English town, and alternates between the present and the past as you follow the main character Ben, who is on the run from a mysterious group, to find out who's after him and why they want him. I found the cast likeable, and the alternating timeline helped to build suspense around what's really happening at the University. The book ends in a way that indicates it's the start of a series, but the main story in this book has a satisfying conclusion and gives you enough answers to things that you're not left hanging about everything. It was an enjoyable read."
1,"This film was originally conceived as a satire on the ""White Queen"" who is the daughter of the wealthy and powerful woman, the Queen.  The film was shot in a very large city with many beautiful women.  The film was shot in the spirit of ""The White Queen"" with no racial or gender differences.  The film is about the rise of the female monarch, the Queen, and the Queen's rise to power.  The Queen's rise to power is not based on the fact that she is a woman, but rather on the fact that she is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful man.  The film does not attempt to challenge the notion that the White Queen is a woman, but rather to examine the relationship between the Queen and the wealthy and powerful.  The film does attempt to show that the Queen is not the daughter of a wealthy man, but rather is the daughter of a powerful man.  The Queen's rise to power is not based on the fact that she is the daughter of a wealthy man, but rather is the daughter of a"

The front wheel is a good value for the money and I would highly recommend it. The front wheel does come with a small case which is nice to have in case you have a problem.

I also ordered the traditional fit and it's lil more flush against the finger since it lays flat compared to the comfort fit. Comfort fit is rounded and sticks up from the finger slightly more. This ring is true to size but traditional fit runs 1/2 size smaller. Comfort fit is the way to go... The ring glides on/off like butter. Also 3mm is just right... Not too gaudy but wide enough to take notice. Love it!  Update 12/2015: I was able to go to Benchmark ring website and register my ring even though purchased from Amazon. Be sure to email Benchmark and ask about the registering your ring for their Lifetime Guarantee program. They have excellent customer service rep!  Update 5/2016: I am happy to report, after wearing the ring 6+ month nonstop, it is holding up nicely! Still shiny and polished. Some scratches but no big deal since I am hard on my hands as it is to be expected while doing the dishes, shower, cooking, etc."

0,"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.    Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like."
0,"This has become an essential tool to restraining my ever growing labrador. She is not out of control by any means, she just gets very excited about her walks and has a very powerful 4 wheel drive system that I cannot compete with.  She was also pulling hard enough that she was choking herself.  The choke collar would be counter productive in those terms, so decided to go with the pinch collar.  We tried a harness, but that only let her pull harder.  I was about to send her to Alaska to become a sled dog. Just kidding, we just need some time to work through it.  The first day I put this on she pushed the limits and yelped a couple times.  Since then, she has learned to respect the collar and we have not had any issues since.  She only goes to the end of the leash and lightly tugs at moments where she is really excited to meet another dog, while still respecting the collar.  Otherwise she has learned to leave some slack in the leash which is comfortable for both of us.  This product has made our walking experience infinitely more pleasurable.  I highly recommend."
0,"READ THIS BOOK!!!  I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. He was required to read this book for a college economics class. I absolutly fell in love with this book. I do not read much, so an 1100 page book is a big undertaking for me. I will pass on what my friend told me:  The first 200 pages will seem slow because of the character discriptions and history. Give it those 200 pages and you will be hooked and it will read a lot faster. It is amazing that one person could compile everything that is in this book. What a work of art. As a reader, you will definetly start looking at the issues surrounding you in a different light. Only negative:  ""The Speach"" at the end of the book. It's way too long winded and over the head. Suggestion:  Listen to this speach on youtube to help get through it."

I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac.

0,"I had such high hopes for this chair.  I'm suffering from a minor sciatica pain and I had hoped that a chair like this that would relieve lymphatic vessels around hips would help.  But this one did not.  I couldn't find a comfortable position.  After only using it for a few hours, my shins were slightly bruised! (Purple veins were apparent)  I tried not to put too much weight on the knees/shins, but then my pelvic bones were in pain like I was on a bicycle for hours.  So I would put my weight back on my knees/shins, but then I would have pain in my shin - not so much in the knees.  I decided I couldn't work like this for 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.  So only after a few hours of use, this item is going back.  The user should be able to adjust the angles of the seat and the knee pad to fit the individual's needs.

The growing love story was exactly what was needed.  And the baby was perfect, even if she was too young to speak.  I really wanted to have a bit more at the end.  There should really be a short wrap up at maybe 6 month or a year later.  Other than that, it was fantastic."

1,"I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had! Firstly, the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there; they looked dingy or just plain dirty. Second, I went to function one night and came back in late so I was really tired the next morning, hence I slept in late. I put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean. Obviously, the room service lady can't read. Third, and worst of them all, when I checked I was only allowed valet parking so I gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece. Well, the next morning when I asked for my car to be retrieved, there was a big dent in the driver's door of my 2010 Mustang! I was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that. In the end I had to get my door repaired on my own! The only thing I liked there was the food and it wasn't even all that. I was so disappointed and so I'm warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation."

0,"I absolutely love this Black Dome Tungsten Ring.  I wanted to get my hubby a wedding band that is different and unique.  I fell in love with this one, it is solid black and polished.  This ring looks so good and is made very well.  I got a size 9 which fits my hubby perfectly.  I have a ring sizer at home and this ring was sized exactly.  The ring is heavy for a normal ring, but that is expected from a tungsten ring.  He says it fits and rests comfortable on his finger.  Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.  This ring is very durable and will last the test of time.  It has a nice polish and since he has been wearing it, the polish has held up really nicely.  He does a lot of hard labor and nothing has scratched it.  I completely recommend this ring.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own  opinion and I was not compensated in any way."

0,"I bough this when I was living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.  I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.  You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)"

The amenities were not what I was looking for, and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests.

Additionally, it doesn't work well outdoors unless it is on super smooth pavement.  The result is that we have to use it indoors.

He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures.

I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos.

0,"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.  I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.  It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.  I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.  I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.  It's a very quiet fountain.  You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound.  I don't unplug it at night.  It runs 24/7."

0,"I'll keep it short. My wife, daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. Location: It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. Hotel: The hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. Maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (I think they missed a night). Service: Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. There was no shortage of people to ask things. My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. They shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. Other: We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. Pool and changing areas were spotless. Room: Clean, sunny and spacious. Probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 TVs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. The windows open for some fresh air. Pillows were pretty comfortable. With all aspects considered, I think this was an unbeatable value! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. The airlines have cornered the market on that."

We dined in Seston's Chop House, which I highly recommend. The staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience. The Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City!"

0,"Location, location, location. What a great find! Excellent, well-run, small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it. Rooms are good-sized and clean; good bed and shower with tub. The air conditioner, as mentioned in other reviews, is noisy, but it's a minor complaint. The staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge. The on site restaurant is great. The red-line El is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze. You are footsteps away from Rush Street and North Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan. I would not have a moment's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future; in fact, I wouldn't book anywhere else."
0,The quality is excellent and worth every penny.
1,"Awesome bang for the buck.  I use it as an emergency light for my work, camping, and just to get things done. The light is bright and is easy to use. The light is nice to have around when not in use.I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the price that's going to cost you. I'm very happy with it. I've had it for about a year now and I love it. The only reason I didn't buy it was because it's a bit of a pain to install. You have to get it to stand up to the elements and it's really hard to do that with the ratchet. But I'm glad I did. I'll be using it to make wood pieces for my wall or other things that I need to do. It's also a little hard to pull it out of the way. You have to get it on the floor and hold it down while you try to get it to stand up. I'm not sure how"
1,"(I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review). This book was awesome. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance. The characters were well developed and the storyline was full of action. I liked the fact that it was free, and it was a free book. I just didn't care for it as much as I did the other books I read. Overall, I liked this book. I really enjoyed this book, it was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a short story. I read it in one sitting. I'll be looking for more by this author. I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is determined to be happy."

It was a huge hit.  She loves it!  She loves the sun and the stars.  I think it will be a great addition to our party.This is a fun game for my son. He plays it by himself and I like that it's not too complicated for him to play. The kids enjoy it too.My son loves it, great size.These are super cute and my daughter loves them.

I haven't tested it by putting in the washer or dropping it on the ground, but it claims it can survive some abuse.  I would believe it based on how rugged it is.  It is very small so make sure you do not lose it.  My only complaint is that I wish they made these in a 256GB or 512GB models."

0,"This hat goes perfectly with the ""queen of hearts"" costume. It adds some cute flare for pictures. However, it did not work to wear the hat all night. The hat portion slides onto a headband. The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely. The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."

0,"WOW there are a million pieces to this set! Once we got everything punched out and sorted we could begin to build. The instructions were easy to follow and the pictures really helped. Sorting through the pieces was challenging but part of the fun. We built one ogre based on the instructions and found the pieces to be very easy to work with. The pieces are very cleanly cut and fit together well. They are soft but sturdy and will hold up to many robot builds. We went on to free build and found that to be really fun also. The possibilities are really endless with this set and I can see even teenagers enjoying building and creating different designs. Once the ogres and creatures are built you can display them or disassemble them to play another day. Fully assembled the largest ogre is about a foot tall. They store well in the box, but we opted to separate the pieces into baggies for cleaner storage. A very nice set!"

It does not work with the standard Android phone or tablet.  The charger is not a fast charger but it will charge it in about 10 minutes.  I will definitely buy another one.

It truly is amazing what you can do with your mind and you can tip the balance of any situation just with a thought. I feel like now I am more focused, conscious about my surroundings and kind of like more in control of my life. Really good book and worth the read for sure!"

1,"This is a party game, and it's a very fun game.  There is a lot of strategy involved, but the stakes are high.  The players are not the same as other games that have a little strategy involved, so it's a fun game.  But you have to know what to do to get the hang of it, and you have to think about how you're going to do that.  It's a pretty simple game, but it's well made and fun to play.  The goal is to have a group of people who are going to be in a circle with the other players.  Each player has a different kind of magic that they use to bring down the other players.  Some of the magic works better than others, but I think it's a good way to mix things up.  I think the players are going to like it, and they're going to have fun playing this game.  It's fun, and the rules are easy to follow"

1,"I was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel. The walls were paper thin, and I could hear conversations in the next room. This is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel. The room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price. We were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room, something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning. We requested new towels, but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request. The check-in process was frustrating, mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter. I don't know if she was having a bad day, or just happens to be in such a mood all the time, but either way, it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with. Overall, not a pleasant experience. I think next time, we'll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago."

1,"This hotel is beautiful, it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it. The location is wonderful,it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier, which was a great place to show the children on our vacation. We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car,and the valet was very nice and helpful. I also take my work with me everywhere I go,So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus. They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing. This place is great for the price, due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is. This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay."

0,"Excellent ending to the series. Sometimes you read a group of books and get to the end and think ""meh; I spent all that time reading for this?"" Not the case here. Storylines are wrapped up and all the appropriate people live happily ever after.

0,"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

After a little work, I was able to install Ubuntu on this drive and dual-boot between Linux and Windows 8.1.  Booting into Linux is super fast, even compared to regular Linux boot times.  For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down."

I highly recommend the whole series!  I really enjoyed Stella's character. She was very realistic, down to her insecurities. Because we all know sometimes we aren't as confident with our bodies as we would like to be. I loved how the two guys were each their own person. They had completely different personalities which lead to different working relationships and what people thought of them. I thought that was really unique because often it seems multiple characters will start to essentially merge into one.  The love aspect between Stella and the men in this book was a little hard to believe compared to some of the other books. It felt a little rushed. But beyond that I loved it! Still absolutely worth the read!!"

This book is a must read for any creative mind.  I would recommend it to anyone who is into music.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little"
1,"So, I volunteer at a shelter and I bought this harness for my puppy who is a strong chewer. I had to replace the harness with something that would keep him from breaking his neck. I still use it, but it's a little thin and doesn't stay on for long enough to hold up well. I also have a large dog and I think this has held up well. This harness has held up pretty well. I have a 60 pound terrier mix and this is his first time using it. I will definitely continue to purchase it. Overall, it's a great harness. It fits him well and my dog seems to enjoy it. I would definitely recommend it to any dog owner."

0,"This movie is as funny as parts of the other 2 at times but i wouldnt say its as good. It has some funny moments but also some very stupid non funny moments. The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator. Overall i give it 3 and a half stars. Pretty good."

1,"I ordered this LED as a replacement for the one in the saw.  The yellow LED has a very strong yellow tint and the bright white LED is the lightest in the saw.  I have had no issues with the saw.  I have had no issues with the blade.  I have used it with a saw and it is very smooth and smooth.  It has also been very easy to install.  I used it to hold a cutt down fence in a wooded area to cut into wood.  The saw will cut out a 2-4"" strip of wood and then it will put it back together and hold it in place.  It is a very durable tool.  The saw does a good job of holding and holding the strip in place.  It has a very smooth cut and the saw is very sharp.  I would recommend this saw for anyone.I really like these. They are great for taking a shower. They are very bright and they are very small. They fit my shower head perfectly. I use them for a wide variety of tasks. I have used them for very small jobs, I have had them for a long time and they are very handy. They are a good size for small jobs"

0,"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.  Please feel free to ask me any questions about this item, and I'll do my best to answer.

0,This is a really good ladder.  My only criticism on the installation instructions is that they should have a picture that illustrates where the retaining bolts/nails go instead of a written description.  A picture is worth 1000 words (and they only used about 20 to try describe the nail placement).

1,Amazing RAM. I've been using this for 3 years now and I'm still happy with the performance.Great product. Great price. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it's working perfectly. It's not a huge improvement from the original unit I had.The device does not work with Android 8.
1,"but just couldn't do it. For reference, I bought the size 11 in navy blue, the size 11 in red and the size 11 in black. The navy blue is a darker color and the black is a lighter color. I wore them for about an hour and still have no complaints. They are great for lounging around in the house and on the beach. They are very comfortable and look great. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. He is 5'10"", about 165lbs. He is 5'4"", 140lbs. He has had them for a couple months and they have been great. He said they are comfortable, but I would have given them 5 stars if I had not worn them. Very comfortable, it is a little narrow, but I have a very small chest. I have a large chest and it is tight, but not too tight. This is my second pair of this cute leggings. They are very comfortable and fit well. They are soft and comfortable. The color is exactly as I expected. Great, very comfy, I ordered size up as needed. I wear a 7 1/2 in skirts and these fit perfect!I had a little trouble finding a pair of Levi's that fit, but these were perfect. I love that they come with a zipper, but they are very cute."

I would buy another medium.This dress is really cute. It is well made and very comfy. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter. She loves them.These are super cute and comfortable. I have had some bad luck with some of the other reviews which I found were misleading. I got a size small and they fit perfectly. My daughter is 5'2 and 125 lbs and these were the perfect size for her. She wears a size 8 and these fit perfectly. They are a little small but I will order a size up if needed.

1,"I almost didn't buy this, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the collection. Great product. Great price! I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is by far my favorite. It is a great set. I would recommend this to anyone. I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she loves it! She is a little rough with it but she has had no problems with it. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too hard for her to put together. She is 5 and she loves it. I ordered this for my 6 year old son for Christmas. He loves it. We had fun building it on his own. He has learned a lot from the pieces and I think it will be a great addition to his collection. I think it is a good size for a small child. My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train. He plays with this every day."

0,"Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades. Yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. But other things have gone downhill. For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. I, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home."

0,"Crate was delivered promptly and packaging was in good condition.  The plastic pan is good quality and it was in good condition.  The only issues that I saw are the number of doors and the thickness of the wire cage.  The fact that this cage only has two door eliminates you being able to put two pups in or take two pups out of the kennel with ease.  You would have to remove the center divider.  The other potential issue is the lightweight gauge steel that the kennel is made out of.  Our two GSD pups get excited when we come home and jump on the kennel walls.  The walls are flex enough that the pups can actually open the side door when they jump on it.  For the price point though, this kennel was a really good deal."

0,Had one before over 10 years.  I left it on my deck year round in all types of weather.  Very durable and most important it makes it easy for taller dogs to drink.  The adjustable height is great.  I've even attached an umbrella to keep the water shaded from the sun!
1,Fits 3M V1000 8 Base (Cordless) and is a nice light for the price. Great product. Great price. I am using it in the garage to cover a shed and it works great. It will be a perfect addition to my collection. I purchased this to replace the old stainless steel bottom with a new one. The old stainless steel bottom was so bad that I had to replace it with a new one. The new one came with a very new stainless steel bottom.
0,"I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.  And this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level.  I catch my cat sneaking over to my dog's food bowl and eating this food, too.  I have to look into getting her some Harmony Farms!  I can do this because Harmony Farms is really good quality food that is affordable."
0,"Well, first off, I unfortunately didn't realize that this was more a novella, at just 95 pages rather than a novel, and with a title like 'Frenemies', I expected something perhaps a little more intense going on between our H/h, but other than some witty sparring and a bit of sarcasm, things were pretty tame, in my opinion. That is not to say I didn't enjoy the story. Until I realized that the story was actually shorter than I thought, I couldn't put the book down, but I finally did because it was the early morning hours and I knew I could finish it off in the morning. Patrick, our hero, could be every girl's dream, and Cat is your smart-mouthed, spunky best-friend. I think this could be the perfect book to read at the beach or by the pool. It's light, fun and short. Just right."
1,This is a really superb tool. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver.

The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.  I had to replace the tool with another one because the first one broke and the second one had no way to turn it on.

0,Been in use for a week or more.  Installed easy and never made a sound I could hear even on high.  If installed properly it will not even wobble.  Only draw back is it uses the very small bulb type and they cost a bit more than the medium bulbs.  I knew this when I purchased so I will not drop the five star cause its a fan I wanted and I love the look and function very much!  Recommended!!

It's not the best book I've read by far, but it was definitely worth the read.  This was a very short story about two people who are still in love.

0,"I have mixed emotions about this water filter system. I love how it is hung from a tree, and doesn't require pumping, but I did run into problems. I used it for a week in Boundary Waters, at least the bag. After 4 days,providing water for 6 people, the filter was completely clogged, and is incapable of being back flushed. The pre-filter screen was not fine enough to catch the ""material/ suspected tannin"" in the BWCA water. I eventually attached a Sawyer inline filter to the outlet hose which got me through the last 4 days. My Base Camp Pro did come with the new and improved filer, but it couldn't handle what I needed it to. I love the idea, but was pretty disappointed."
0,My daughter loves this. She uses it like a purse and can put it over her shoulder not just carry it with a handle. I like that she has a place to put all the loose poniville ponies and accessories that go with the houses. It came with one pony which is an added bonus for the price.

1,"We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! Fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. Once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. Needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again, let alone any other Hilton around. Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago!"
0,"Gargoyles has got to be one of my all time Favorites and it an American production too, now that's really something. However, Disney on the other hand BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! I think that Disney is owned by a Secret Society and that's why they're so EVIL.(PH34R T3H 3V1L) Can you think of a better EXCUSE? Why is it at this time when Disney is restoring all of thier past successes, Master Pieces of all time, all of thier best productions, that at this time one of thier greatest TV series ever of all time is being forgotten? Have they forgotten Duck Tales? Gummi Bears? Dark Wing Duck? Tale Spin? Chip'N'Dale Rescue Rangers? No they are putting all of these shows on DVD. So how about finishing Gargoyles? Oh, and that reminds me is this Season 3 actually the Goliath Chronicles or is that still yet to come? I hope to see the other half of season 2 come soon and for the completion of season 3 without any breaks like there is in season 2.

0,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).  At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.  But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."
1,"Even out of the box, it's an excellent value for the money.  I'm not a professional so I don't know how well it holds up to use.  I used it to make a couple of circular cutters, and it worked great.  I used it for the diamond cutters, and it held up very well.  I'm very happy with this product.I just installed a new shower head with this kit.  I have a well built shower head that uses a lot of water pressure, so I was worried about the water pressure coming out of the head.  The kit provided a good amount of water pressure, and I could not wait to use it.  I have installed this shower head at my house and I can tell you that it works perfectly.  I wish I had purchased it sooner.  I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Milwaukee automatic tool.  Easy to use and a great price.These are really bright.  They are brighter than the other lights I have purchased.  I love these lights and would recommend them to anyone.Great, very strong, and I like that it doesn't come on at night.  I also like the fact that it is fairly dim, which I believe is a great feature for a small room.  My only complaint is that it's not very bright, but it's"
1,"This is not your typical thriller. The plot is fairly predictable, and the characters are all pretty typical. There are some good points, but the movie is not a typical thriller.I enjoyed it.  It is a good movie, and one I would watch again.The series was well done.  I liked the acting and the movie had a lot of action.  I also liked the ending.  I felt like the show was on a downward spiral.  I think that is what happened to the writers.  The writers kept going, and I was disappointed.  This series is a good one to watch for that reason alone.I've been waiting for this movie for a long time.  It was a huge disappointment.  It's not a bad movie, it's not a great one, but it's"
1,"Overall, the hotel was okay. Though I did have a problem with the price. The accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate (other than the supposedly luxury mattress, it was not more comfortable than my own mattress!); but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel! There is a difference between the Palmer House Hilton lobby, and your normal, affordable lobby. But, I do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby; I go to get a good night's sleep. When I want to sight see, I go elsewhere. Like I said, overall, the hotel was okay; but it was not worth the price."
1,"These are great! I was hoping to add a little more variety to the game, but this one is a lot more unique than I thought.  The basic game is pretty simple, but that doesn't mean it's boring.

0,"The book was so, so good. I couldn't put it down because I definitely wanted to find out how this story was going to play out.  Talk about the sexy banter between Amber and Lance...so, good!  Lance mouth was just so deliciously sexy, off the chain.  Amber says ""You're not coming over"" Lance says ""I will be there and we both will be coming later""......Daym that was Hot!!  He can sneak in my bedroom at my parents house anytime!  The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate. He's all messed up, want to read more about that species relations thing, hope there's a shifter females and vamp hook-up, witches were mentioned and did they say dragon shifters....Whoaaaa!  Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!"

0,I loved this book. I've read a lot of the books on grain brain and paleo-type lifestyles. This was one of my favourites because it was so easy to read and presented the most compelling research. Dr Perlmutter makes it very hard to dispute that grains are not great for our bodies. Definitely worth a read.
0,"Another excellent party favor! Although not the best quality (handles are plastic, paper comes unglued easily, plastic latch breaks off) the colors are fun, you get a variety of patterns and they last through a few vigorous fannings. My only complaint is that the emoji themed fans were almost impossible to use since the diameter of the fan portion was so wide that there wasn't much handle to hold on to...there were 12 of them. Otherwise, the remaining 36 fans were great for the kids at my son's bday party."

0,"I really like this alarm clock so far.  It works very well with the iPhone and I've only had a few small issues with it.  Occasionally when you put the iPhone in the cradle it will only start charging the phone, but it won't play the audio.  I've only had this happen maybe twice since I bought it 2 months ago.  I think it's something to do with if you're playing a song already when you plug the phone into the dock.  It looks great, and I really like how the dock slides back into the clock for when you're not using it.  The dimmer is nice, but I wish it would maybe go one shade darker.  The audio quality is superb considering the size.  Overall, I'm very happy with the money I spent on this unit compared to the other ones available on Amazon."

I've been very umpressed by the power and have never seen a toilet this powerful in a home. It is not any louder than the standard toilet being replaced either. It has been clogged, so its not unstoppable. However, it was easy to clear and extremely rarely happens. It looks great too. I had no problems installing it myself and have since helped a family member put theirs in too."
0,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932.

0,It is not twistable after being in the freezer. I always have to put it under tap water for a while before I can twist it. Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 or more containers to fit a normal size bunch of parsley.

The screen is not super sensitive and sometimes it takes a few try to change the volume or move around the iPod menu to change a playlist. I haven't noticed any tears in the armband material and it has held up well to my various workouts in the gym and on the courts. Solid product, good price. If any issues crop up (good or bad) I will edit review as necessary."
0,I love this mat!  We put our auto water dispenser on it for our dogs because they tend to dribble all around the water dish and it was constantly wet.  Now the water doesn't sit on my floor it stays contained to this mat.  This mat is silicone so it is flexible and easily washed (can even go in the dishwasher if you choose!).  We have been using this for over a year now and I absolutely would recommend it to anyone wanting to keep that food and water mess contained from those slobbery mutts we love so much.

She received a gift card for Amazon for Christmas so she rushed to the computer to buy it.  When I got it and over the weeks she's had it I am really happy and content with it.  She made a great buy choice.  It doesn't run out of batteries quickly and it stays soft and cuddly when being squeezed each night by a little girl.  Good buy!  I strongly recommend if looking for something like this, and it is bright to create enough light to make a small one feel safe, yet not too bright to keep them awake."

0,"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties. While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring. Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father. While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances. The remastered copy is easier on the eyes."

Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.  I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.  The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.  I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did."

0,"Mary Shelley, who, in my assumption, was truly a fascinating author. She weaved together a very fast moving extraordinary saga, THE LAST MAN that kept me enthralled. Lionels life began on a cheerful note, but then tragedy struck. As I watched Lionels emotions go from sorrow, to bliss, back to sorrow, then grief in one brief moment took him by the throat and would not let go until his heart was broken. As deep depression set in he felt pure torment and could do nothing but try to comfort those around him as his dear friends, neighbors, and family departed, one by one, from what seemed to be a never-ending epidemic that swept through each countryside. This skillfully written masterpiece of a seriously tragic and also an intensely passionate story regarding love found, then lost through devastation, which led to unspeakable sorrow and loneliness, held me as I read line after line, and page after page, savoring every word. As I followed Lionel through his existence, in each chapter he must take action against this foe that always seemed to have the upper hand in everything, and yet, each time, he knew he must move on because of the need to find others. Will he have to live in constant silence, or will there be someone out there waiting to be heard? From the Sibyls Cave, where it all seemed to initiate, all the way through to the end, or the start of a new beginning, this fascinating tale of intrigue led me down some desolate paths, and through some unforgettable and very picturesque forlorn valleys."

Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:  Easy to clean, easy to open.

0,"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.  This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.  My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past."

1,saw this in the theater...really enjoyed it.  Not too many people who have seen this movie would agree that it is a great story.  The acting was superb.  The performances were just as good as the movie.  The story is told in a way that you would not expect from a film about a love story.  The story is told with a passion that you will never forget.  This movie is a must see for any romantic
1,"Of course this is a film with the usual formulaic clichs and elements, but this one is a very interesting film. I liked it and am glad I bought it"
0,"The first third to a half of the movie was slow, repetitive (part of the story line but it was basically boring), and not engaging, but I kept watching it  based on the 4.5 stars online review.  The last third was better and it had a decent ending. But I would not watch it again as it was just to boring to get to that point."

Like the way the writer takes you back to what has happened over the years to the family and fills you in on all the details.  Wish there was another sequel to the book!  Would love to read some more about the McCabe family."

I won't even wear the bottoms because they aren't made very well and the top fits extremely awkward, not because of my body type, but because it seems to have been thrown together to sell and ship quickly.

I don't want to put you off by a lot of the twists and turns in this book. I'm glad I did. This is a great series for the fans of sci-fi, and it will make you laugh and cry with every page.I love this book. I read it once a year and it was one of my favorite books of all time. I couldn't put it down. I will buy the next one. I love this series. I loved it and am reading it again.  I read this book one year ago and I had been reading it since. I enjoyed it so much I bought the next one. I read it again in a year and I have read it many times. I have never read any of the books on the series.

I am 5'4"" and it fits a little small for me. I have had trouble with other shoes, but this one works great for me. I just wish I could have gotten a size smaller.These boots are perfect for the weather. They are a bit wide but I like them and they are comfortable. I can wear them all day at work. I will be buying more colors!Nice fit, very comfortable, with good support. I wear a size 8.5, so I ordered a 9. I ordered a 9.5 and they fit perfectly. My only complaint is that the fabric is thin and uncomfortable. I wore them for a few hours and they didn't seem to be very strong, so I returned them.Very nice and comfortable!  Perfect fit!  Not the most comfortable walking shoes, but I think it's worth the money!Fits as expected. Will buy again.This is a good quality wallet"
0,"I can't think of any words to express how utterly devastating this documentary is. Through tragedy, this documentary seems like a sweet rememberance to a good friend, despite what the premise it is heart-warming the sentiment the friend (Kurt) put effort into this documentary, until the story unfolds. Nothing can prepare you for it; as a mother, a father, a grandmother, grandfather. It will squeeze your heart, and it's hard to breathe as it unravels. The Bagbys are so amazing, one can not fathom how strong they must be."

It was well written and kept me interested from the very beginning. I enjoyed the storyline and the characters. I also enjoyed the story line and the ending. I was really looking forward to the next book in the series. I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss books and this one is no exception. The setting is a small, isolated island with a great feel for a place where people live. The story revolves around a woman named Hannah. She is a single mother, but she has two sons."

0,"The price and comfortability of this mask were the 2 best things about it, which are 2 very important things to have in a mask. The negative, for me, was the fogginess. I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well. It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3. If that was not the case, I might be tempted for a 5 star review, but 4.5 is probably more accurate. Great feel, comfort, size, and price."

0,"Broke in less than 24 hours.  Probably more like 8 hours.  Come to think of it, it was about 8 trigger-pulls.  The battery connections went bad, and the pump developed a horrible leak.  This wins the award for cheapest piece of junk ever made.  Luckily I like fixing things, so I cut the handle off and installed my own battery box and replaced the pump tube with a much higher quality hose.  As pieces of it break, I will fabricate parts until it becomes a sentient cyborg bubble beast and takes over the planet."

1,"I felt as though Mora was an incredibly sweet, funny, and sexy heroine. She was just a little too self-conscious for my liking. The way she treated the bullies and other women that came into her life was just ridiculous. The one thing I really liked about the story was the way it kept you guessing. I could see why the author felt it was a little over-the-top for the most part. I think that's why I like"

People thought I had made the dress because of the quality look. It fit true to size. Only down side, the elastic at the arms is too tight.

1,"I had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago. What a joke. To start off, the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed. I don't know who made the bed up in my room, but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. Ditto the bathroom. Water spots, soap scum and (ugh) hair of ALL kinds in the sink, tub and about the floor. GROSS. I requested non-smoking, either they didn't listen or didn't care, but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. The 'beautiful view' was ruined by water spots - not outside(which is forgiveable) but INSIDE! And they were sticky. I stayed only one night. The Holiday Inn had rooms available, and they were clean. Never Again."

0,"It should have worked, because It's a fun idea, but it falls painfully flat. It's hard to imagine Michael York as a serious seducer for one, and two, Angela Lansbury gives a performance that suggests that she is on a stage. It was a box office disaster, and you can see why. Harold Prince was a great stage director in his prime, unmatched really, but his two efforts into film, this and the appalling mess he made of 'A Little Night Music' revealed that he just didn't know what to do with the camera, or how to direct actors for film. Someone should turn it into a musical. I think it could work really work."

0,"That's a ""you go girl"" both for the super spunky heroine who doesn't want to wait for a knight in shinning armor to save her, but instead is ready to solve the mystery herself and live for herself instead of following conventions, and for the author Anne Osterlund, who took on the big task of writing a first book and turned out a fun read (also because I sort of knew her when we were little, so I'm impressed that a small town girl has done big things!).  I really enjoyed this story.  Even though some of the events in the plot may seem familiar to those who like romance/fantasy, Anne did a good job creating a fresh take on those events with her original heroine.  I'm hoping for a sequel maybe, and look forward to reading more by this author!"

1,"I stayed this hotel for 2 nights. I had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures I've seen. Upon entering the building, you can easily see that it is clean and high class. The lobby was nice, and everything seemed as it should be. However, as soon as I made it into my room, it was completely different than everything previous to it. It was dirty, visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. The room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms I've been to. There was also a lingering smell from the last tenants. When I called the front desk about these issues, they sent someone up to fix it. I left the hotel about two hours and upon returning, they were still at it! This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors. The smell also did not completely disappear when they were done. As I was too tired, I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead. I hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me."

0,I use this for soda on the golf course and it keeps the ice out of the mouthpiece very well. having tohold the cap out of the way is kind of annoying but it is worth putting up with. It keeps the liquid cold for at least 5 hours as that is the length of time I am on the course and it is always cold at the finist of the round. It fits in the cup holders of most golf carts.

1,"I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. When we arrived at the hotel, the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system (I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it). After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked. We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically. I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money. I for one won't be going back to this hotel!"
1,"I'm lucky i didn't actually go to the movie, i was in a mood for the action and the story. I've seen a few movie with the same theme. I've been to many movies with the same theme, but this one was different. I was very disappointed with the story. I was hoping for something different. I didn't think so. I didn't want to give up hope. The only reason I gave up hope was because I don't have the patience for a movie like this. I'm not a huge fan of movies where a bad movie takes over. This movie was a good movie. It was a good movie."
0,"Best machine for the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three or four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!  It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five or six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and remove the grinder for a more thorough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months or so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes for the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!  I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.  I can't recommend this machine enough for coffee lovers. It makes the best espresso shots anywhere (we love Lavazza espresso http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Super-Espresso-Coffee-2-2-Pound/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1419869268&sr=1-2&keywords=lavazza+expresso), is easy to use and clean, and is a fabulous value.  You won't want to buy a latte at a coffee shop again."

0,"Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier works.  Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warriors from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  ""gwali.""  The princes of the realm are handsome and heroic, their  princesses beautiful and spirited.  The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a storyline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight or substance to the  tales, and harbor some doubts that the ""Riftwar Saga"" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests. Nonetheless I  will admit that so far Feist's stories do offer facile moments of unadorned  diversion and amusement."
0,"This bed might work fine at a smaller size...but the large size was very flimsy.  The sides collapse in on themselves when the dog isn't in it so it looks like a heap/mess on the floor.  It is durable enough and easy to wash...and the pillow is detached from the bed.  If the pillow isn't in the bed the whole thing really falls over.  I would not buy again and have just left the pillow out on the floor for the dogs."

I'm glad it was longer, because it was well written and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book. I'm not sure how I feel about this story, but I am glad I got to read it.

0,"This product seemed to work perfectly well. However, I put this on my keychain, which went into my pocket. The problem is that the little white cap falls off all the time. It is too loosely fitted to the drive, making it fall off with little to no force. It was only a matter of time before the cap fell off without my noticing. Now, I have no cap, and the device is pretty worthless to me without its cap."

1,"I am puzzled by this book. The author has no idea how to make a complex universe, and is basically an old man. The author also takes the reader into the realm of his imagination. The author does not delve into the details of the construction of the universe, but instead does a great job of explaining how the universe works, and how to make it work for you.  The book has a lot of fun, and is very educational. I think that this book will help you to become a better person, and I would highly recommend it.This book was just ok.  I had read the book several times and was a little disappointed.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction.  The author does an excellent job with the setting and the setting is a good place to start.

0,"When I was a little girl, I had a wolf ring that I adored bought in some tourist trap Estes Park, Colorado, Keystone, South Dakota, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, someplace like that which I honestly don't remember, but I loved that ring, even though it was a man's ring that only fit on my thumb.  Alas rings that a child can afford are not the best quality and the silver plating quickly wore off my thumb turned green and I could no longer wear it.  When I saw this ring from Moon Wings, a company I have had nothing but stellar experiences with, I knew that I had to have it, but upon reading the other reviews I realized that this ring is very big and clearly a man's ring I changed my size from a seven to a nine and decided it would work for either myself or my boyfriend. It is lovely. There are two things I think the future buyer should be aware of the wolf is not the cuddly sort, he looks to my eye angry and ready to kill, if you are a wolf lover who wants a gentle noble spirit animal, be aware.  Also if you wear this ring as a statement to the viewer of your hands rather than yourself, in other words facing outwards, the little stainless teeth have a real tendency to catch on things and if you wear it the other way to the observer it kind of looks like nothing much just a canine of some description.  I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review."

0,"This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.  It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.  The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.  The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned. All in all I'm pleased, other than the fact that my Earth Brown turned out to be Dark Brown, a color not even listed as an option by Amazon. The tag says ""Earth Brown"" but is not the color shown on the ordering page.  I won't knock it a star for that though I'd rather have the Earth Brown I ordered, or at least something that resembles Earth Brown more than a bar of chocolate."

0,I bought this to replace my 30 year old single speed Dremel.  WOW!  Shouldn't have waited so long.  All the attachments really make DIY home improvement so much easier.  So much fun to use that after I'd had it for a while I found myself looking for ways to use some of the attachments I hadn't yet needed.  The only thing that's not so great is it seems to be in a box meant for more than one model - so there are molded places to put things that aren't included.  That takes up space in the box that could be better used to store what DOES come inside & would make it easier to put stuff away.
0,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.  Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.  Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon."
0,"After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!! East of Eden was heavy for me!! Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed. The Theme: Brother vs. Brother The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on him. He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come. The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say ""History"". The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money. I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!! Overall, a great great awesome read!!"
0,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss."

0,"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.  There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?  At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.  There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.  The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.  The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.  If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.  Was it perfect?  No, but it came close."

He loves this toy but also it'll frustrate him. First of all, the front-window-compartment is very difficult for the kids to take off. The only way, to place a fireman on the drivers-seat is to take off this window-compartment. Second of all, the ladder comes off every time, my kids just touch it. A grown-up has to install it back on the firetruck. I don't know, why Playmobil couldn't come up with a different solution for this, but it's very frustrating for the kids, that it won't stay installed and they can't fix it themselves. The ladder won't stay up plus falls off the truck. The rest of the firetruck seems very sturdy and has bright colors. Love the sound-effects on it. Not too loud."

The one came on, the other I needed to use the pull chain for, however that's when I discovered their lack of quality. With the slightest pull on the pull chain the whole switch and bottom plate came off. In looking at where the screws go in, everyone of them was split. I took the other one down and examined it and it was in the same shape. I don't have time to mess with returning them and having a dark shop for a week or more while the replacements show up so I just drilled out where the screws go through and used small bolts, nuts and washers to mount the switch plate back on both of them. It won't come apart now, but I have doubts that these will even be functional in a years time with as cheap as they're made."

0,"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy. The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces. Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there. These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.  I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?  But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far. I am hoping they make a 3.0 version with a  heavier base and no areas where kibble pieces can get stuck."

We had a double room in the main tower. The room was very clean and updated. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The negatives about this hotel is that you have to pay extra to use the fitness centre and internet access. Also, parking is high ($45 valet/day). Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel. We paid $90 on Priceline and felt that this was a reasonable price."

1,"I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago. I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago's exciting night life. I found The Talbott Hotel's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for. The price sounded reasonable, so I booked a room. The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that Friday afternoon. After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. They blamed this on shortage of maids that day. They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. This disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again? Probably not."

I would read a whole series on the main concept though.  First rate.
1,"The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at. I've never been to Chicago before, but the location was fantastic. They had all sorts of different rooms, from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms. I've never seen so many options for rooms. The room I stayed in was well worth the nightly price. The location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation. We have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency."

Here's a quick example.  ""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""  That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.  Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass."

0,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."

What's more scary then the movie is the people who gave this film 5 stars. 48% of 50 some reviews gave it 5 stars?!? How is that even possible that at least 25 people on this planet, and I know there are more, think this is as good as such horror films that generally get 5 stars from fans and critics like Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St, The Exorcist ect... Obviously there is a second edit of this movie floating around that I'm not privy to. A edit that incorporates everything that makes a 5 star horror film. Gore, suspense, good acting ect..... Man I would love to see that version!"

0,"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers. They're fun and affordable and can save you lots of time bending over to turn things on."

0,"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.  The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.  The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.  If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR."

0,"It's a good message, and the illustrations are really captivating, but the story is very didactic. The message is very clearly ""be yourself"", and it hits you over the head with that. The illustrations are fun to look at. If it weren't for the heavy-handedness of the message it would be a really good book.  The story is reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. There's a girl who really likes lima beans, but nobody else likes lima beans so she always lies and says she doesn't because she's super worried about what everybody thinks of her. Because of that, she starts changing colors based on what other people want her to be. This expands to changing shape, and then becoming even more surreally assimilated into all the furniture and decorations in her bedroom. At the very end, a little old woman says, ""I bet you want some lima beans,"" and the girl says, ""No! Nobody likes lima beans! Wait, never mind I like lima beans!"" And then she eats the lima beans and everything is fixed. Ugh. The message is so obtrusive.  For more children's book reviews, see my website at drttmk dot com."

0,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!  Of course, it helps that I love Bob."

Our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. I'm not a germ freak or anything; however, I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to. The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention (FCCLA) and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it. The noise at night from every direction. The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party. Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic. With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another, absolutely ridiculous. The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo. During our second night I finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the Hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasn't anything they could do. ...read more"

It was an interesting story and I'm glad it ended. I enjoyed the characters and the story. I'm not sure how I feel about this author or the other authors. I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait to read the next book. I have read this author before and she is not my favorite. I have read all her books and have enjoyed them. I look forward to reading more.
1,"Oh, please, not these two. I'd love to see more of Olivia's work, but she's not the type of character I want to have a crush on. She's a strong, independent woman who will do anything to keep her best friend and lover safe. I love the way she's able to keep things in the family and not let her daughter go into any negative situations."

1,"Effects as good as any of the original movies. I saw this one a couple of years ago and I am very happy with it. The sound is great. I can't wait to see it on DVD. I will be watching it with my friends. Great Movie!  I found it to be the most entertaining movie I have seen on DVD since the first one. I will buy it again. I am so glad I did. This is a great series for kids to watch. The kids will enjoy the story, the characters, the action, the action and the action and the action is great. I would not recommend this to anyone under the age of 13. This was a wonderful movie. It is a wonderful movie to watch for the entire family. I wish they would have done this movie for the entire family. I wish they had made this movie for the entire family."

This is a very small light, and it's not very bright. This is why I ordered this lamp. It's a great lamp, and it will last me a very long time.  I will say that I have not tried it with my other two lamps. I have tried both of them, and they are both very dimmable. The only drawback is that they are not ""over"" the dimmers, but rather they are ""off"". I don't want to overheat them, but I don't want to overheat them. I can't think of"
0,"Be aware that there are only three Melies shorts on this disk and only one of them is in color. A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W. There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.  For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search ""melies flicker alley"" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too. The DVDs actually look better than the color version here."

There is a small seam that can be taken out and resewn, but I wouldn't want to do that each time I need to clean it. The sound quality is pretty good for this toy, but IMO, the music/singing isn't all that easy to understand. My one year old didn't play with it for more than a minute. However, every child is different so your child may get more use out of it.  We have other fabric books that don't have a sound box that rely more sensory objects like mirrors and textures that keep him engaged longer than this book did."
1,"The InterContinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure. Nestled deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown Chicago, the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm. From the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high Romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites, the InterContinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler. Book well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of Chicago."

I would recommend it.This movie is excellent. The acting is outstanding. The storyline is interesting and the directing is outstanding. The story is a little slow at times but overall, a very good movie.I love this series. I loved the way they created the characters. I loved the way the series turned out. I'm not sure why the producers didn't make it more interesting. I like that they didn't try to put every one of the characters into a movie.I'm a huge fan of the WW2 movie genre.

0,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".  Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.  Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.  In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).  Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.  You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!"
1,"Let's be a little more specific. The fact that these two men are also Christians doesn't mean they agree on every thing. I am not saying that the Bible isn't a very interesting book, but it is certainly not a very informative one. If you are looking for a good read, then this book is for you. I had to give it a pass because I didn't like any of the characters. I found it to be very predictable and a bit of a mess. I did find it interesting that the church has a theology of death and resurrection, but I didn't find it particularly interesting that they have a theology of a woman and not a theology of a man. I found it interesting that the church does not believe in a person who dies in a few days and has a resurrection. I found it interesting that the church does not believe in a man who dies and has a resurrection. I found it interesting that the church does not believe in a man who dies and has a resurrection. I am not saying that the church didn't have a theology of death and resurrection, but I am saying that it did have a theology of a man and a theology of a woman.

The only thing I had to change was the size of the hose. This is a large hose that is about a 2/4"" diameter and will fit about 3/4"" of the hose. I just went with the smaller hose.

I gave one to my son and immediately he asked us for more so I got him this 5 pack.  Be aware though that there is a version two of this bug which does a little more things.  These little robotic bugs run around like little bugs bumping into things and changing directions.  It seems irradic for the most part, but the packaging states that they do have basic sensors that allow it to react to its surrounding.  If you have a little boy or girl that likes lego, robots, and r/c stuff I am sure they will like these little guys."
0,"I cut this device a lot a slack in terms of criticism because it was so inexpensive (under $40).  It works as described and, with a little tedious fine tuning, it delivers a pretty clear picture. But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception. When used with a Slingbox this camera makes a pretty neat nanny cam--the live feed can be viewed from any web browser or from a smart phone (e.g. iphone, blackberry) and can be recorded to PC if desired."
1,"It's incredible how many movies are made by the studios in the last 30 years, and how many we get from them. The fact that they took out the first studio copy of the film that we have now, and in the process copied it into the film, is a great testament to the creative vision of the studio. I especially liked the fact that the studio version was so much more realistic and modernized, with its original look and feel.  However, when I first saw this film, I felt that I'd missed something, and I'm not sure why. I was a little disappointed by the fact that this film doesn't have a lot of great dialogue, and the actors in the film do a great job of portraying them perfectly. I can't imagine a better actor to portray a young man who is the leader of a gang of people who kill everyone in sight, and then later get their revenge"

0,"I am an Asian and am 5""3' tall and weigh around 101 pound. I usually wear ""x-small petit"" in the US size. In trying out this cape coat, I can tell this coat is probably made based on Asian size, which means the size would be one to two sizes smaller than the US size. When I live in Taiwan, I usually wore small, and after I moved to the US, I wear x-small petite. So be aware of the size before you purchase this item. I will say go one size up if you follow the US size. For example. If you usually wear small in the US, you probably need to order a size Medium for this coat. I ordered an x-small. It fits, but the shoulder part might be a little bit tight. But I guess a small might be even better for me. The style of this cake coat is simple, cute, and elegant. It will go well with almost anything. It is light weight, and the texture is soft. It is sort of ""thin"" compared to a regular winter coat. It would be good for spring or fall l, but for winter, it will be too thin for me. The quality of the coat is ok. I won't say it is made from very good material. I can tell it might get wrinkled easily (for its thin material) if you do not fold it neatly. Overall, I like this coat. For its price, it is good enough."

0,"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.  Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.  The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!  What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.  What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does."

So I reordered in an XXL (I normally wear an XL) and it fits well over my motorcycle jacket: it doesn't flap around like the XXXL.  The zipper feels sturdy and the item seems like it will last a long time.

0,"I was scheduled to stay at the Hard Rock in June, but had to cancel. I had booked the hotel back in January. When I called six days before my arrival date to cancel, I was told that I would be charged for my stay because I did not cancel seven days in advance. I told the customer service rep that I had never heard of such a practice, but she said, in a very smug manner, that I was told back in January. I honestly don't remember being told of the cancellation policy, but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel. I, for one, will never stay at a Hard Rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice."

0,"Sad that catholics in america, who have eaten so heartily at the protestant table, while bringing so many terrors into the country, would want just more ""spin.""  Against a backdrop of their open border policy (Hart-Celler), the legacy of Kennedy's, the Jesuits inciting Latinos with ""liberation theology""  (anti-anglo-protestantism) to ensure newcomers will be filled with that peculiar hate as the border is opened for them---- such same old!  And instead of a warning to them, and in the world where the Catholic murder of Christians in Serbia so recently (oh, is that just a big silly thing that should be put in ""histoical context"" also?) is known to so many--- one wonders.  Do such people ever begin to take in anything at all of ""the other?""  Even as they moralize?  Even as they harm?  Even as they do not look at their own real history, but only seek to cover it?"

0,"It contains accurate info but the info it contains is so broad that it skims over most of US History--I guess a textbook is supposed to to that in a general sense, but as a professor I found it lacking and wouldn't have chose this one for my course. I see that it comes with nice online components and is fairly modern but as a student reading it for a self-propelled style course that I took for fun I found that many of the test questions weren't even in this material and I could read it and not know about more than half of what I read. I did appreciate details that weren't in the textbooks of the 1990's like union strikes and monopoly dealings and a greater emphasis on race relations in mining and Native American dealings (more history being revealed) but over all I found the book a bit boring and strangely organized and lacking in depth.-- It jumps too fast post 1900 onward.--It seems to be cramming more history into the same length of textbook these days is their solution to the problem of more and more history being revealed, but I found it more of a problem. 2.5 stars."

1,"Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. I chose it largely for location as I don't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food, of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. Our room was amazing. Seriously amazing. It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse. I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. It was fantastic. For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable. The staff was friendly, the hotel beautiful, and the food delicious. What more could you want?"

0,"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.  These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.  The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.  Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family."

0,"I bought 2 and they are functional but made from cheaper material than I expected.  This isn't a deal breaker for me, but be forewarned, they seem to be made out of aluminum that is only slightly thicker than a disposable casserole pan (that can be purchased from the grocery store).  Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.  If you are looking for something fancy, this probably isn't for you. If however you are looking for an inexpensive way to contain grease splatter, then you will be pleased with this product."

The movie is a bit cheesy, but it's a very entertaining movie.I had no idea that this film would be so well written and acted.  The acting is great.  The story is well told and the story is very well told.  I highly recommend it.It was a fun movie.  The special effects were excellent.  The cinematography was superb.  The music was very good.

I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story."

There was much more destruction than your average alien-invasion movie has, but like the old A Team tv show, it wasn't real violence. Thor's one good line was something like ""you're right about Loki--his actions aren't rational. But he is an Asgardian."

Everyone but the two of them knew what was going on.  I just enjoy the innocence of this series and it reminds me of the great adventure of college life and friendships.
1,"I bought this air ratchet and it works great. I also love that it's reversible and can be used as a push button, both with and without a belt. I used this to make a little makeshift bench outside a garage. I also like that it has a lot of pockets. I have a few sizes of thumb caps, and one is a little larger than I expected. This one fits perfectly. The only reason I didn't buy it for the buck was that I needed one for the little shop vac. This one is a great size."

0,"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.  G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.  This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.  CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.  Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:  G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts. A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.  Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage."

1,"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a total of three days, and through out my stay I had a wonderful time. The room was impeccably clean, as well as the pillows and sheets. The beds were large and extremely comfortable. The staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. From the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, I got the best customer service. The hotel was also conveniently located. It was within walking distance to the shopping center. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago."

It comes with a dvd, air pump, and as part of the Zero Impact Program, a tree is planted with each purchase. It's a great value for what you get.  I like to use it to aid stretches, sit ups and push ups--makes a world of difference.  Being the visual creature that I am, I really appreciate the unusual colors Natural Fitness offers in their products.  If you love your gear, you will enjoy your activity more.  And with these tools available, there is no reason to buy the standard, often toxic equipment."

0,"As always, Grisham delivers very captivating story line. Rather than last me for a while as an ""occasional"" read, I blew through this one in just a few short days.  Character development is spot-on, and the depth of information about the challenges faced by Appalachian Miners is very revealing.  I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.  I was also disappointed as I expected some follow-up editorial information/direction regarding the plight of the miners. Was it fully fact-based, an entertaining, yet trumped-up piece of fiction, or something else entirely?"

Our cast of characters (or actual people in this case) includes the Clune family, the Glenn family and the Brooks family. The Clunes are, essentially, rich people (two adults and four children) from Malibu who live in a mansion. The Glenns (two adults and two children) are a middle class, church going family from Tennessee. The Brooks are something of an evolving family. They start out as a young man and his father, and become a young man and his new bride two months into the project. The families are very different in background and personality, making for some very interesting, not to mention entertaining, community interaction."" (from epinions)   Thank goodness, we were not born during this time. Life was difficult and if you did not chop enough wood for the coming winter, plant enough food for your root cellar, store enough food for your cattle and chickens and build shelter for them............you were not going to make it on the FRONTIER.  This is exceptional viewing, especially for todays children, to see what it was like to survive in those days on the Frontier.  Let's all be thankful for modern day conveniences.......ALL OF THEM.  A good DVD to buy for your library, I recommend it."

I've read a few of the other books in the series, and this one was a little different. I would recommend it. I really enjoyed this book. I love a good mystery with a good twist. I have read a few of her books and she has always made me laugh and cry. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I was hoping for more from this author. I liked the ending and she did a great job of showing us the world we live in. I have been reading some of her other books and they all had great twists and turns. I hope she continues to write better. I've read all of the 3 books by this author. I have no idea how to rate them. I don't really know how to rate the 4 of them. So far I have not gotten into them. I just know they are good."

0,"We purchase these cute little shoes for our little son and since he is a boy we chose this navy blue and white combination for him.  It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.  Anyway, overall, this is a very worthy purchase.  It actually has a bit of room for his feet to grow into which is nice for it means that he will be able to use these for a longer period of time. I was able to get this very nice item on a discount and I am glad to share to you all as well my fair and honest feedback about it.  My review on this product was based on my experienced with it through testing it or using it after receiving it."

The lobby is very impressive, the room was very nice. No complaints at all, from check-in to check-out. I was alone so didn't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves.

0,I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep. The front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend (gossiping) as I checked in (VERY unprofessional). The room she offered me was on a 'high' floor (5th.... HA) and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtub....I was DONE. Called down and had them re-clean the room; they made no offer to compensate or upgrade...not even a bottle of wine. The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room (like I have time for that). Disappointing as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member (btw they've done away with the amenities...you just get a free item from the mini bar).
0,"I adore the 'Lord Peter' series of books by Dorothy Sayers. I found this to have a darker feel to it than most - perhaps due to the lowering skies under which it's set. The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.  Incidentally, the story does not involve clothing or any form of haberdashery."

Libby has a complex about her looks and an eating disorder she has trouble controlling. It is all mainly due to her beautiful sister who recieves all her parents attention and the fact that she stole Libby's first boyfriend she loved..She can't believe when she meets Jax, that he could care about her the way she looks. She is scared that if her sister meets Jax, she will steal him away from her like before.

Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.  Pros: -Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent) -Follow Focus included -Matte Box included -Light weight -Quick release mount -Price -Easy to put together -15mm Rod System  Cons: -Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason. -No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution). -Rails are pretty short.  Why I think one should buy this? -You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price. -Up-gradable (You can add on things later on) -15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day. -You get all the essentials."

0,"My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel. The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. The rest of the staff however was terrible. When we first checked in, I was instantly discouraged. The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn't wait to leave the lobby. Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. At one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. Even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. Yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. For how much money we paid for each night, I would have rather stayed somewhere else. We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews, but we did not experience any of this during our stay. The rooms were alright, but nothing special. I would not stay in this hotel again."

Based on this experience, I set about replacing my old Sears 19.8V tool set with Black & Decker 20V Max tools. (The Sears batteries were no longer capable of retaining a charge long enough to be useful.)  The BDCCS20B circular saw is a new addition to the 20V Max family.  It serves me well for trimming shelves and various projects around the house.  And unlike the old circular saw, I don't have to stop every half hour to replace the battery pack. My new 20V Max tool set also includes the recip saw (also reviewed) and the edger/trimmer.  I will continue to rely on Black & Decker for more 20V Max tools!"

0,"Purchased the G-3 with 14-42 kit lens plus a 45-200 and 20mm lens for travel.  I am a serious digital outdoor/travel photographer but tired of traveling with 28+ pounds of pro. level equipment.  I was looking for a ""go light"" quality built camera with lot of features and adjustments.  It came down to the Panasonic Lumix G-3 or Olympus Pen.  The Panasonic won the contest because it has both and high quality LCD screen AND a high quality viewfinder (although it is electronic not optical.)  In addition the LCD screen folder out and rotates270 degrees which is a very handy feature.  If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.  The only serious limitation is with the available reasonably priced lenses, the are relatively slow compared to more expensive 35mm camera lenses.  This is the reason for the 20mm lens, at F1.7 it is better for lowlight indoor or outdoor shooting."
0,"After watching the Sharpe series on video I decided to read them in print.  Bernard Cornwell wrote this book first, although chronologically it is not the first in the life of Richard Sharpe.  What a great story!  It has all the elements of a great adventure.  This book is a page-turner from the very beginning.  This is a great book for the history buff - or anyone who loves an adventure.  One of the things I like about Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books is that they are great stand alone stories and you don't feel that you need to read the entire series in a particular order to enjoy them.  I have bought several copies of Sharpe's Eagle and given them as presents to those hard-to-buy-for men on my shopping lists."

1,"These are very simple to install. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.  I had to replace a couple of the light fixtures in the house and it's still working well. It's a little pricey for a new light fixture but it's cheaper than the other lights. I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see. I just installed them with the wire stripper and they work great. It's very easy to program and to program them for a specific purpose. You can program them for a specific area by either clicking on the box and selecting the desired color, or by turning on/off the light. I'll be using them for the new home and I hope they last a long time. I've had no problems with them so far.  The installation instructions were good but I found myself wanting to return them.

0,"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro. Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)  Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG. I did receive a complimentary unit for an unbiased review, but honestly they would have been my first choice for purchase anyway. They have a loyal customer in me though I would be sure to let you know if they dropped the ball in any way with their products."

0,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."
0,"Perhaps it was bad luck for V. Hislop that I came to this book immediately after Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue - now there's someone whose characters zing off the page, from whose pen flows effortlessly great prose and who can put together a damned good story. None of  which, sadly, applies to Ms Hislop. OK, so I might have been dazzled by Telegraph Avenue, but I think that even if I'd read The Thread close on the heels of say, a thoroughgoing perusal of the phone book, the latter would shine by comparison. I think that Ms Hislop intended The Thread to be a peon to Thessaloniki which is, I'll grant her, a great little city. But it never comes to life; if there is such a thing a taxidermic prose, Ms Hislop can do it. Poor old Thessaloniki is just a one-dimensional sketch under her hand, a stage set about which she poses a cast of cliched cardboard cutouts (the Nazi's mouth is 'thin' - aren't they always? - the protagonist's bad husband is fat and smelly; the university students are all intellectual firebrands. Etc etc). There are far better books than this about this area and this period. For example, anyone who wants a great fictional account of the sack of Smyrna should read Jerusalem Poker (Edward Whittemore), or Middlesex (Jeffrey Eugenides) or Birds without Wings (Louis de Berniers) while Alan Furst's Spies of the Balkans brings pre-war and wartime Thessaloniki beautifully alive in a way that Ms Hislop could only dream about. Don't waste your time with this book. Read something good."

0,"These shoes are so comfortable you will not want to take them off.  Even my sensitive feet with bunions are very happy in them.  True, they are not very elegant, since they look somewhat bulky, but at this point I prefer comfort over style.  The inner sole is soft suede with some cushioning underneath. I don't think the insole is real suede, rather it is microfiber and the upper lining is definitely synthetic fabric.  I bought black size 9.5 M and they are both slightly longer (26.7 cm=10.5 in) and seem wider than most medium widths since the fabric mesh allows more width flexibility above the sole.  They are not suitable for persons with very low or very high insteps as the zipper on top does not provide any width regulation (unless you leave the zipper partially open). The upper opening does not fit snugly on my low instep foot.  However the back sling has some elastic under the buckle, so the length is flexible and can be additionally adjusted by pin holes - I had to use the first pin hole. So, I would label them at least 9.5 W. I lowered the rating for incorrect sizing to fours stars.  The insole has perforations under the ball of the foot, which means the moisture gets under the lining and ... the odor stays longer. I used them in tropical weather (on a cruise, both on the ship and on the land) for less than a month and they already stink, though I do not have any sweating problem.  I also got surprised that my French shellac pedicure got stained, not only on the white strips, but on the clear body of the nails as well. My black microfiber suede tote bag also stained my French manicure, so this is the fault of the fabric stain (and shellac polish vulnerability). Maybe the light colored sandals don't stain though.  I lowered the ratings to three after one month due to these two problems."

0,"I thought this was just okay. It is nice and thick, but did not keep me superbly warm, so I was disappointed since it was quite pricey. I thought that these wool thermals would be considerably different, but it feels like I am just wearing a thick 100% cotton top. It is also a loose fit."
0,"This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.  The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.  While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike."
1,"Solid construction, it's not cumbersome, and it's lightweight. It's also a very strong one. I had to replace a solid one with the TRS-80, and that one came with no issues. I think it's going to be a very good investment. I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony A-100 (which I've had for a while). This new Sony A-100 is much more compact and has a very good sound."
1,"Whenever I decided to stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park, the only thing that I had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband. However, the hotel choice wasn't the best. Right in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation. The room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room, which was much smaller than the original one. The hotel did give us a discount, but if I'd paid for the large room was because I wanted the it. A hotel with this name shouldn't put its guests in these kind of situation. I wont be reserving room there again."

0,"Nothing special here. Good inexpensive headphones that are comfortable on your ears and head.  These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight and yet do not fall off the head easily. Of course I am not exercising with these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on the head during a workout.  A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.  For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or the dog eats them not much of a loss.  Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better than these cups."

1,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had! From the first moment we walked in, we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby. I casually mentioned that it was our anniversary, and after we came back from dinner, we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. The staff was professional but friendly, and made us feel so welcome. The room was immaculate, the furnishings were so plush - we didn't really want to go home! Room service was prompt, and the views were spectacular! We are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat."

I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that had a broken seal."
0,"Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007. Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile. Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist. Dinner at the restaurant was also good. Prices are reasonable. Room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago. Concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet."
1,"With 2 dogs and 4 cats, I thought it would be a nice addition to the house.  It's not.  I am not saying that the plastic is not great, it's just not made well.  The carpet is very thick.  I don't know how long the rubber will last.  I will probably just stick with the plastic on my carpet.  I will say I will buy another one.  I'm not sure what it will hold, but I don't have to worry about the rubber pulling.  I will definitely keep it, but I'm not sure what it will hold.  I do like it though, and I'm glad I did.  I like that it's a bit small for my cat, who weighs a bit less than a cat.  But, I like that it's not as heavy as a plastic bag.  I don't really mind the weight of the plastic,"
1,"UPDATE: I bought a second pair of the same pair in a different color, and the first pair was a little too tight around the heel.  The second pair was a little loose around the ankle, and the third pair was a little loose around the toe.  I ordered the full size of the 2nd pair, and it fit perfectly.  I am very happy with this purchase.I love these shoes! I wear them all the time, and have a pair of Sketchers for my father's birthday. I usually wear a size 7, but ordered a size 8.5 and it fit perfectly! I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone.This is my second pair of these. I have been wearing them for about 3 years and I can tell they are comfortable. They do run a little small, but I think they are a good size. I wear a size 8.5, and these run a little large. I would say that if you are a size 7, they are going to fit you, but if you are a size 8, they will not. I have had them for a few months now, and I do think that they are very comfortable. They are not bulky at all, but if you are a size 7, they will make you feel very comfortable. These are a good buy.This is a good quality wallet.  I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit.

If that's not amazing, then I don't know what is.  Important Note: my 980 Ti is not the EVGA reference version, but the MSI reference version, so the provided plate does NOT fit. I had to leave the plate off, but it did not affect performance as far as I can tell."
0,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.  But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.  For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.  Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.  It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."
0,"This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect ""huggable"" size for my 1 year old.  The small animals/food for the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is for the baby to ""feed"" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine motor skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the ""right"" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails or a play yard - at least according to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.  However, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy."

0,"Blasphemy is the second book featuring Wynam Ford (now a private detective). In this book, Ford infiltrates a government-run facility which has built the world's largest particle accelerator for a mere $40 billion. (Please suspend your disbelief.)  I like the way Preston has worked together several subplots which all culminate at the end of the book for a complex climax. I am also a fan of Preston's easy writing style--it's good for a quick read. I am not a fan of Preston's portrayal of Born Again Christians--I think it's a bit over-the-top, though I guess it's a reasonable depiction of a very small percentage of rapture-ready Christians. Also, Preston is clearly not a physicist, but I guess not everyone can be perfect. :) Overall, I think Blasphemy was good for a quick sci-fi/techno read, but shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a beach-book."

I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it.

Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat. Now I will be honest, I am not sure how this  bed would hold up if I had owned it in my younger days, back when we were ""getting busy""  on a regular basis, but I would highly recommend it for a bed that is used for sleeping!!!"

Amity. Erited. And one more which name I can't remember. Beatrice's test results are divergent. This is bad. On choosing day, both Beatrice and Caleb have to chose their fraction.

She needs to jump on a train, then on a roof, then of into a net in a underground hole.

The room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. I was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed. Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed."

He seems to hate Ailig and it becomes clear why. The story held my interest. It just doesn't have much romance going on an very little sex nothing even worth mentioning. Bk. 1 and 2 just lacks that hot sexy romance story I like in the H/H. These books end abruptly for the couples. There is no epilog to let you know how the couple fared together. There are unanswered question. Such as Morainn believes she is barren. She tried to have children by her dead husband but didn't. This could have been the dead husbands fault!!

We did some switched batteries and tried some minor problem solving but the car just wouldn't work correctly.  Contacted the company and received a prompt response back.  Did the steps as was recommended to us from Tech Support and then gave them the results.  They again responded promptly and advised that they would need to send out a calibration tool but with the holidays and such we wouldn't have it until after the 1st of the year.  No problems here.  Rec'd the calibration tool earlier than I expected and performed the steps that were supplied and everything works great!  Couldn't be happier with the support we rec'd.  ...and love this racetrack.

The book is very interesting, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the West Indies. I do think that the author should have included some very interesting facts about the West Indies, but I would not recommend this book to anyone who is not interested in the history of the West Indies. I have read some of the reviews of this book, and I do not think that this book was a good read. It is not a history book, it is a history of the West Indies, but it is a history of the times."

1,"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.  The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.  The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.  Henry Ewing's father was very good at sports, but his mother was a bit too shy and a bit too violent.  In the movie, Ewing is a bit of a troublemaker who"

0,"Bought by Nicolette Hugo  Designation: Standalone, 302 pages  Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.  The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.  Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.  So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.  There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.  *REVIEW STARS* Hero: Killian 5 stars, Jerricho 5 stars Heroine: Scarlet 5 stars Steam Level:5 stars Plot: 4.5 stars Overall: 5 stars Cliffhanger: no  I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book."

0,"I was contacted by this vendor to provide a review in exchange for a discounted price.  That said,  I'm glad I purchased this toy.  My male cat especially goes crazy over it.  My female cat hasn't bothered with it as much but hasn't been feeling well in general.  Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.  Two items I would like to see the vendor improve would be including felt pads underneath so it doesn't scratch my wood laminate floor (I will add some felt furniture pads underneath).  Second, increasing the post diameter at least one inch. Currently it's under three inches and a little narrow."
0,"Ok so I just got these and they fit really well (In my opinion). Im a womens size 7 1/2 and I got in a mens 6. These are the Rewinds and the seller says that they are in men sizes only.  When I first got the skates I had a hard time turning corners but after loosening the axle a bit I still have trouble but its probably just because I need to practise.  The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.  For an affordable skate its good and from the looks of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates.  So basically size is good & fits good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels."

0,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?  I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.  Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.  I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.  Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much.

0,"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it."

1,These take up the entire room. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of things. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is very fragile.

0,"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)  Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.  The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made."

It had everything you could possibly need. I almost didn't want to leave the room. It was definitly worth the price. I would go back. The clientel was also very helpful.

0,"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.  Pros:  * Image Quality * Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays) * Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%) * The user manual is decent, though not stellar. * Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good. * Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).  Cons:  * Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help. * Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel. * Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus. * Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.  Conclusion: I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.  BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.  If you care:  You can see my photos with this camera on Flickr at: [...]  I ordered the body w/o the kit lens, and instead got the Canon 17-40mm L zoom and the Canon 70-300mm IS zoom.  At some point I'll add the Canon 50mm 1.8 lens."

0,"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.  Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.  Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."

I use it in conjunction with my wife's weekly work out and exercise routine.  I've had it for a few months now and it's very effective.  I'm impressed.  It's not a terrible feature, but I find it frustrating that there's always a manual entry that is only a couple of lines long.

1,"Love, Life and Everything Else (Cora Deleuze's book)  The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.  This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written.

It is a very colorful and rich look for our guest bedroom. You could use just about any color of sheets with this and it will look great.

0,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.  The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.  The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.  The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.  Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.  They fit well though, and are comfortable.  I wish the material was a little thicker, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and stick with four stars as long as they hold out."

0,"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.  I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.  The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage."

Outside of Rick, Daryl, and Andrea however the other characters are weak. It's not a good thing when you don't really care if most of the cast gets killed-off. Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful.

0,"HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage Set-This 3 piece set arrived within 2 days. Thanks Amazon Prime! I have to say WOW! I am pleasantly surprised by the quality. This particular set is in WHITE with a shiny finish featuring a vertical grooved pattern. I'm hoping the pattern will prevent denting. There is a protective clear plastic wrap encasing the set. Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper. It compresses your clothing & frees up valuable space. As I visualize the airline terminal staff tossing my luggage into the back of a transport vehicle & loading tons of luggage on the conveyer belt, I have a feeling these 3 pieces will survive the airport onslaught. Love this my new luggage."

0,"This game has become one of our family favorites! I play with my eight year old son, my seven year old daughter, and my five year old daughter. It's a great game and finally after months of me winning every game, my kids have all beaten me at least once (and I do not believe in throwing a game). The board is set up like a map of the United Sates and each person is giving routes that they have to complete. You get points for completing your route, or you lose those points if you don't get them. The concept is relatively easy, but it's a lot of fun! I only have one real issue with this game and that is that the cards used are small cards - not your standard playing card size. It's terribly annoying for shuffling, etc. I really wish they'd make them standard size instead."

It is so much better quality than I expected and very well made.  The fabrics are all nice and thick and everything is quilted and padded and double/triple layered fabrics. I expected something thin and sort of cheap like dress up clothes, but it is nothing like that at all. It is really nice.  The chefs hat has a nice thick comfy pink band around the head and the white part is a soft, almost silky feeling type of fabric. It lays nicely and is not stiff to fit oddly or stand up awkwardly.  The little over mit and pot holder are quilted and adorable.  The apron is put together so nicely with nice thick material and perfect hems.  The utensil set is a thick hard plastic but has no rough edges to worry about scratching any surfaces. I thought they'd be more like dollar store quality acrylic utensils, but they're not. They're cute and nice quality.  This set totally exceeded my expectations and it is just adorable."

Overall, I liked this book. I really enjoyed this book, it was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a short story. I read it in one sitting. I'll be looking for more by this author. I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is determined to be happy. She doesn't want to go back to her past and finds the man who she loves. This story is a great read. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The romance is great, and the story is a great follow up. This is the second book in the Standalone Series. I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review. I am a fan of the author's writing and this one had me hooked. I am looking forward to the next book. I am not sure if this is a continuation of the series, but I am not sure it will be a standalone, so I am not sure I will read the next book. It is a great read."
1,"The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me. I chose it because it a Hilton hotel, but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name. My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff. My room might have been luxurious years ago, but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening. The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible. The food served by the room service and at the hotel's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus, and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine. The food simply did not deliver its promises. Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small. The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage, since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions: however, the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by. Overall, this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range."

The weight sits really nicely high on my back and doesn't feel like it pulling me into bad posture. While the bag is relatively expensive, Arcteryx goods are always high quality and last years. I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone looking for a 22 L bag to use as a day bag."

0,"I am a big Beatles fan but always had mixed feelings about John. He was obviously a great musician and showman. His Imagine album is wonderful, and his plea for peace in the title song is downright anthemic for the peace movement. He truly believed in love; his favorite lyric was ""All you need is love."" At the same time, for much of his life he was often nastily sarcastic, hotheaded, and abusive, especially when drinking. My understanding of his boyhood before I saw this film was that Lennon liked to exaggerate how difficult his situation had been, separated from his mother and raised by his Aunt Mimi, when in reality he had a very comfortable, secure, middle-class upbringing. I continued to hold this view throughout the film, thinking how good he had it: a reunion with a mother who was fun, doting, and indulgent while being watched over by a strict, but loving, aunt. That is, until the moment when Mimi revealed to him exactly the circumstances of the loss of his father and separation from his mother. Then I got it. And when he finally lost his mother for good, I can see why he described his growing up years as hard. I have much more sympathy for him now."

0,"Life has not been kind to John Moon.  Depressed because his wife left him, he spends his lonely days planning a reunion that will never happen.  Living alone in a cramped, dirty trailer, he leads a hand to mouth existence.  Chronically unemployed, he has taken to poaching to put food on his table.  One morning, Moon hunts and wounds a deer.  Tracking the animal to a nearby rock quarry, he senses movement behind him.  Reacting instinctively,  he whirls and fires a single shot into the surrounding wood, and sees something brown crash to the ground.  Assuming he has downed the deer, he begins to walk towards the trees.  It is only after he is charged by the wounded deer that he realizes he must have shot something else.  When Moon investigates, he discovers the body of a young woman.  Struggling to stay calm, Moon conducts a search of  the area, and discovers the girl's belongings, along with a package containing some $80,000 in cash.  Moon, overwhelmed by events, decides to hide the body and take the cash.  Shortly thereafter, he finds himself at the center of a bizarre series of events, as the money's owners eventually trace it back to him.  Moon, unable to contact the authorities, becomes involved in a life or death game of cat and mouse with ruthless criminals who have only one goal--to get their money back at all costs.  A Single Shot is a convincing portrait of a simple man caught up in circumstances beyond his control.  Moon's anxiety and despair is palpable, and the sense of menace Jones creates is almost overwhelming at times.  Grim and macabre, this gripping saga of small town mayhem and madness will shock and disturb you.  Reminiscent of the work of Jack Ketchum and James Dickey,  A Single Shot really hits the mark."
0,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew. Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it."
0,"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try."

0,"Just a heads up, if you have read other timeless romance anthologies, then you may have read some of these stories before. Five of the six are found in other anthologies. Regardless, some of the stories are definitely worth another read. I didn't particularly like the first story, Our Song Cassie was a bit too whinny for me, but that was more personal preference than a reflection on the story. War of Hearts also felt a little contrived, but I am sure there are those that would disagree. I did enjoy Between the Lines. The romance was so cute and I couldn't help but root for Thomas to work out his mix up. I also loved William and his concern for Claire in A Taste of Home.   Both these stories had swoon worthy endings left you rooting for happily ever afters. All in all a collection of great stories and definitely worth the read especially if you are new to Timeless Romance Anthologies."

0,"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).  I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.  7/10 would recommend."

The chemistry between Theo and Kiera is so intense. I can't wait for the next book to come out. I love the way the author brings the story to life and how the author goes from being a great story to a great book. I highly recommend this book.I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is able to take care of her family, and how she is able to put herself in a position to make it work. I really enjoyed the characters. I can't wait to read the next book.I have read this author before and she is not my favorite.  I have read all her books and have enjoyed them.  I look forward to reading more.This was a really good story.  It was not a bad book, but it was not the end of the world.  It just left me hanging.

0,"This kit is great for the money. I have this and have used it many times for my various cameras. I do not have any problems with most of it. They clean as they should and help make sure my pictures are as good as they should be. The only problem I found was that the cleaner that came with mine leaked and I lost some of the fluid. But this is a problem with the bottle it was in not the cleaning aspect of it. I don't understand why some reviews are going against the product, for it is a cheap kit, so you get what you pay for, don't complain you didn't get the world's greatest product for just $10. It does the job it supposed to, are there other better cleaning kits, yes, but for just $10 this is great for casual use especially if you are an amateur photographer."

0,"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim. Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.  And unlike Joe Levine, none of US owned the screen rights to THE CARPETBAGGERS . . ."

She still vomited occasionally, but not more than a couple of times a month. It did not let me put food in all at once, but I was feeding two cats at once in the bowl, so I think if I was feeding only one it would have let me put all of her food in, twice a day."

0,"I have owned this camera for 4 years now.  Pros - Beautiful landscapes.   Amazing outdoor shots and colors   Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too. I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'  Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.  I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.  That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.  I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next."

After several hours each to back up the computers, we are using the SmartWare software to do continuous backing up. It is very cool to see that the newest version of your documents or the new pictures you uploaded to your computer show up on the WD Cloud without any effort on your part.  No set up issues on Dell PC's, one running Windows 7 and one on Windows Vista. Have not tried the remote access function yet - not a high priority for our purposes."
0,"Using his unique style, Vonnegut tells the galaxy about our dying planet.  He sees it as a hideous mess of robotic creatures programmed to destroy themselves, specifically through destruction by American capitalism and racism.  At times this does seem a bit cliche, but his style is anything but.  It's funny, original, and at times very personal.  The best parts of the book are when he literally draws himself into the story.  He tries to be a good God to his characters, but seems to fail as our Creator must have.  It's not as good as Slaughter House Five, but his shocking style is in strong form.  For those who want to pick up the audio version for the Vonnegut interview- don't.  In the beginning of the interview Vonnegut and his interviewer both reveal that they haven't read the book in a while, then proceed to talk about completely unrelated topics which go nowhere.  Tucci does a fine job of reading though."
0,"The world depicted by this book (and what I believe will be expounded on in the next two sequels) follows a few principles of communism - equality, submissiveness, trust, and longevity of life.  Thus, the main conflict is on the issue of ""freedom of choice"".  Being ""Matched"" infers that a pairing decision was made by someone else (an authority) and is similar to an arranged marriage.  The story focuses on how 3 teens cope with this reality as they ""come of age"".  The book is written from a first person perspective.  It is very well written and edited.  The pacing is slower than other dystopian contemporaries, but the flipside of this is a richer narrative of the main character's thoughts, logic, emotion and confusion (I wouldn't quite define it as angst).  Because life is often a battle between money and principle, love and infatuation, organization and creativity, and democracy and autocracy, I think this book is relevant to most people.  It all depends on whether you have the time to spend thinking about these thoughts and options."

0,"This keyboard is pretty great.  It takes a while to get used to... I have an iMac at home and a IBM Thinkpad at work.  I prefer Thinkpad keys, but are getting used to the new Apple keyboard without any problem.  No difference really with the extended wired keyboard that comes with the new imac in terms of feel.  The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...  The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).  This problem doesn't go away when you quite VMWare.  I have to plug in the wired keyboard and mouse to continue.  A bit of annoyance, but won't be a problem if you don't use VMWare to run Windows.  Hope this helps."

'2012' has whacky characters, I love Yellowstone blowing up and the DJ broadcasting it live, a strong compassionate black president, oddly constructive so you're kept guessing as to what the govs are up to, some realism about 'who' would get picked to survive, and lots of visual images of crumbling various national landmarks.

0,"Spent two nights at the InterContinental on a business trip. This is a tremendous, towering hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago -- right on the Magnificent Mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area. My room was in the Historic Tower -- a 1920s Masonic Club which has been converted at enormous expense. The effort has been worthwhile. My room was very large and well furnished, with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle. It had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue. There is a superb recreation centre (with an impressive swimming pool) beautiful bars and a good restaurant, Zest, that serves a great breakfast. There is wifi in the rooms ($9.95 per day) and tea and coffee making facilities. No trouser press, but there is an ironing board and iron. The staff is friendly and anxious to please. I recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms. It's expensive, but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago."

I am going to be using this lamp for a year or so before I can use it"
0,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.  The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.  Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."

0,"Jesse Kellerman seems to be getting better with each book he puts out.  THE GENIUS was much better that TROUBLE, which was much better than SUNSTROKE.  I enjoyed the originality of the story line and, as flawed a character as Ethan was, I really liked him a great deal.  My only criticism is that the ending, while not bad, was a bit anti-climatic.  I read this book while I was traveling and it really occupied those boring hours waiting in airports and on planes.  A four star recommendation for this one."

0,"My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.  The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:  - There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.  - It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.  I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!  In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand."
0,"ISBN 034536161X - Back to books related to WWII and religious artifacts. As a group, these books are interesting if only for the complete effect - from Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders to The DaVinci Code to Indiana Jones, the differences and similarities in the tales are fascinating. Indy begins the book by closing out his nearly lifelong chase after the Cross of Coronado. Ready for a return to the academic life, he returns late for the school year, only to find that his father is missing. Henry Jones has his own lifelong chase nearing an end - he appears to be within sight of the Grail Cup, and there are several groups of people who will do anything to beat him to it. Nazis, Henry's assistant Elsa, and a secret Brotherhood all have their eyes on the same prize, for their own reasons. Who will reach it first isn't nearly as important as who will be allowed to claim it. As adventure books on the subject go, The Last Crusade is an odd mix of lightheartedness and murder, which detracts from the excitement of the story in the book but played well in the movie. Overall, though, it's a nice adaptation of the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam."

1,"I decided this summer that I wanted something with a more substantial design. This is the perfect one.  I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.  I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it has a very smooth surface, and it holds very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I also like that it is not the only spatula on this list, but it is the only one I bought.I got this in the middle of the night on my first night of sleep. It arrived on time. It is a bit thinner than I had expected, but overall it is good quality. It is a little small for my queen size bed, but that's my fault.

0,"Vigilante Force has a hilarious moment where a character tells another character that they can't have a Vigilante Force on their hands to deal with the corrupt cops in the town. The character turns around played by Jan Michael Vincent says, ""you already do."" It's hilarious. It's delivered with the straightest of faces that Jan Michael can deliver and it's got an endearing Keanu Reeves quality to it.  The movie's basic premise is that Jan Michael lives in a blue collar town that's completely out of control. He goes and get's a guy to come be a deputy and clean up the town. Only,, the guy turns out to be just as evil as the guys he's cleaning up. Hence, they might need a vigilante force.  Everyone in the movie is good. Kristofferson is great as always. He's a likable villain who charms his way into his position to take over the town. Jan Michael is the sort of guy you're surprised didn't play Captain America in the 70s. He looks like a piece of by-gone Americana. The actresses are randomly Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal. Both of them are young or youngish and look like the sort of girls you could find ruling as queen bees on opposite sides of the track in a small town. The rest of the cast is great characters actors from TV and movies from back then.  It's not a genius movie. It's a trashy action movie that has some bonkers moments like a marching band member with a rocket launcher. It's also only 89 minutes. It's the best way for a movie like this to go. In and out fast. It never outstays it's welcome. It shows up with a good smile and sends you on your way."

(I wanted to post a photo but my settings has sharing photos blocked). My son is very happy with his new ""tent"" he calls it. Perfect hang out for all his stuffed animal pals & reading books in. I highly recommend this teepee, especially for the price! I wouldn't bother with the more expensive ones because they are only larger (and this ones large!). My son has a standard sized bedroom & this teepee definitely fills out the room.  Wouldn't want anything bigger then this one! If my son had a master sized room I would maybe consider something large but not worth paying almost triple for."
0,"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.  This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.  The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.  Guide: F-bomb. Nudity."

0,"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.  It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.  In short I would say that these are high quality knives, and for the price point, a solid investment."

0,It is okay due to its low price point. It does what it wants to do but the main issue is the white rings. After constant use the white rings loose attachment to the legs and fall off. I recommend saving up a little more to get a Joby Gorilla Pod. However this is still a wonderful few time use product!
1,"I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing the case, but I did. The screen protector is a very sturdy piece of plastic, and it is the perfect size to hold it up to the elements. It is a good size, and it fits easily in my hand. It is a bit difficult to read the screen, but the screen protector is very easy to see. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. It works great. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I use it with my ipod and it does not work with my ipod. I have used it with a couple of my other ipod's, but I find it frustrating to have to push it into my ipod when it's not even there. It has a good little cable to pull in the ipod while it's in the case. It was very easy to install and works great. I would recommend this product. I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She has her own usb cable and it's so easy to use. She uses this for her computer and now she can use it with a usb cable. This is a great product. It is easy to use and does not seem to be a problem at all. It will work in your car if you have a lot of space. I bought this for my older iPad and it is perfect."

I was very impressed with the writing style and the characters. I would recommend it.I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story, the setting and the characters. I loved the way the story went on. I loved the characters, the story, the characters. I liked how the author took a story from the beginning to the end. I was a little confused at first, but I found it very entertaining.I'm a huge fan of the M/M genre.  I've read all of the 3 books in this series, and I have no problem recommending this series to anyone who is looking for a well written, well-paced, and well-written read.  I'm not going to say anything about the other books in this series, but I'll tell you this:  The last book was a bit of a shock, and I was very disappointed.  The other books were very good, but the story was lacking.  The main character, Daisy, is a very good-looking, sweet, determined, independent woman who had a hard time with her mother.  She's a sweetheart and a strong woman, but she's also a great friend.  She's also a beautiful, determined woman, but her heart is a bit broken.  She's trying to figure out how to get through this tough time, but she doesn't know what to do with it"

Even though I bought it 3 months ago, I really hadn't worn it very much except for exercise classes until we took a vacation to Hawaii and then I was really glad I had it!  It totally kept my hair out of my face even though it was quite windy almost every day we were there and several evenings!  We were there for 2 weeks and there was only 1 day that wasn't windy!  I found it very comfortable to wear and I don't have a small head. Was easy to wash out and dried quickly too!  It's very durable.

But I wanted to give the boys a little more variety, so I bought another set with crazy slides and spinning things.. it was terrible.  The marbles that it needed weren't ""standard size"", so you could only use what came with it, and the plastic was flimsy.  I tried another set, from an expensive European company.  That was horrible.  So I'm back to this one again, and we can connect them all together to form a huge marble run. We're having a lot of fun with this.  If you're looking for a good quality marble run, at a good price, this is the set I recommend."

But why the one star?  Well, the set would turn on without any reason.  It wasn't a problem with other remotes or neighbors remotes, for we live in the country.  Had problems getting to customer service but when we did get them tech was nice and very helpful.  He had me do a Hard Reset.  It worked....until six hours later and it went back to turning on by itself.  I really wanted this set but in the end it was too much of a hassle.

Now as high school is coming to a close the pair have decided to attend a party but when Vivienne separates from Ray to use the restroom their world is torn apart in an instant.  Twenty years after the massive event happened that claimed the lives of a lot of the other teens in attendance at the part Vivienne appears out of nowhere. Everyone she knew has aged even though she hasn't at all. Vivienne longs for Ray to also return but when he doesnt she dedicates her life to figuring out time travel to hopefully save Ray from whatever event had sucked her into the future.  A Betrayal of Time by Lucia Ashta is a novella length fantasy read that had a great story of lovers ripped apart but would do anything to be together again. The town thought it was an earthquake that had stolen the lives of their children until the day Vivienne appeared again. Once it was known that she wasn't the only one whos body hadnt been recovered she dedicates her life to figuring out what had happened.  While being a short read the author did a wonderful job weaving together the time travel along with letting the readers know enough about the characters to care about their outcome. This is definitely one Id recommend to the fantasy/time travel lovers out there.  I received a copy from the publisher via NetGalley."

Unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, The Sofitel would surely have it. My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago, one would hardly want to leave. Fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave."

Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.  My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.  I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon.

0,"Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware. BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck. That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work. Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same. If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort. Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door. I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts."

We used it for making homemade bread for two people.  We used it as a quick and easy way to make homemade bread for several people.  We made a lot of homemade bread and it was pretty easy.  I like that the bread is thick and it holds a lot of flour, so it's easy to make for our dinner guests.  We also used it to make a pasta dish for two people.  This is a very handy feature.  I like that it's a small and easy to carry to the counter to store for later use.  I also like that the bag holds a lot of flour so you don't have to worry about it spilling out the bag.  I also like that it doesn't come with a lid.  It's a little awkward to use but it works great for our needs.  I would highly recommend this product.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the closet.

0,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. We waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open, this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two's. Our room had a great view of Navy Pier and was a good size. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. The location of the hotel is the best, we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again."

No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.  Overall, it's a good monitor for little money - just not great. Pros:  Cheap, looks nice, LED backlit Cons: No HDMI, low quality stand, brightness"
1,My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was very chic & upscale; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank.

0,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to. This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out. Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that. The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure! The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice. The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around. The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow. It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too. It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear. Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf. I was fortunate enough to receive this scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge. I used a couple of command hooks to hold my bag up, but it's not an ideal solution."
0,"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?  I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit. The book is a good commentary of realizing that many of us are not ""just fine."

0,"Ordained Irreverence is part of a series of four Elmo Jenkins books.  I have devoured all of them.  They are the greatest.  While I am not part of the inner circle of the church politic, that is to say I don't get paid for what I do in the church, I know what transpires and Moody catches the spirit of the church with such good natured delight and pleasure that you can't help but love him and overlook the obvious shortcomings of those who work within the Body of Christ.  We are human and how God ever made us the holder of His way forward in the world has got to be one of the great mysteries of the age.  Moody captures that conundrum with good nature and good will.  I highly commend all four of these Elmo Jenkins books.  They are worth your eye sight."

0,"Wow! I have to admit this book took me by surprise. I have had a book hangover for a few days since reading it. It's kinda like I'm obsessed by it. It was easy to read and flowed easily. But, the subject matter was a little hard at times, and a little spicy too. I found myself wanting to yell at the hero  and heroine. I guess if you do that, then it's a very compelling book. I felt like I was there along side them every step of the way in their journey.  I went ahead and read the second book because this one left me hanging. I just had to see what happened next in Katie and Keith's lives.(because I feel like family now) I'm very glad I did because it made me appreciate what they went through and how redemption is such a gift of God. I will be reading the third one as well. This book is the first I've read from her and I really did enjoy it. I don't recommend this book for younger girls. I think I would recommend it to girls going into college as a really good example of what NOT to do."

The build is of the same thoughtfully engineered quality that you would expect from OXO and fits comfortably in my hand.

The camera fits perfectly with just enough space for it to go in and out easily, but not move around.  The front pocket is sufficient for a battery, filter, and other small items.

I accidentally ordered 2 shirts of the same color at 2 different times (one for Christmas and one for his birthday) and when I realized it I offered to send one back and he refused saying ""You can never have too much of a great product."" Not to mention he is very particular and picky about his clothes. If you are thinking of buying this shirt you will not be disappointed."

The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all."

1,"Received an ARC for an honest review  Waking Up  by Kirsten Clare  I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.  Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.  The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.  Tessa and Hideo had such a great"

0,"If they are shipped right they are supposed to be firm blocks that's easily crumbled into powdery flaky smell so good goodness for the cats (it appeals to my sense of smell and I HATE the smell of any wet can food)  I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.  My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it. Just crumble it its so easy to squeeze it and seeing it just flake away. I like the ease of grabbing a firm block instead of a messy thing."

I wasn't sure about this one 'quirky characters'...hadnt i read enough of quirky characters? but the characters really surprised and i loved that each beginning chapter was written in first person by violet and then switched to 3rd. She said things in the first part that related to upcoming parts so you 'knew' something was going to happen but you were never sure. Great book, fun characters that sing in a band you feel like you are one of the Clamshells as well (you have to read the book!) It is fantastic to see how Violet turns out greater and greater as life goes on for her. You definitely root for her :)"
0,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better."

From the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small J pin that they wear with nice suits and such, to the wonderful, comfortable beds, the James just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. The gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym, and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition. I really enjoyed the complimentary Kiehl's products as well as the soft, cushy beds with futons. Location-wise, it's just off Michigan ave, and it's close to all the shops and restaurants.

1,"The Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicago's Premiere Small Luxury Hotel. After staying there and experiencing the service, environment, and the hotel in general, I can say with confidence that this just isn't true. I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed. No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself. The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me, leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. Once inside, the atmosphere was not what I expected. The lighting was poor, leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. The carpet looked dirty, as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time, and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. When I arrived at the front desk, I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed. The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. That night I ordered room service. The food took 45 minutes to get to my room, and when it finally arrived it was cold. The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them. I would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends, and probably not to my enemies either. Stay away!"

1,"Swissotel Chicago: Don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. This hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. Firstly, the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. For example, the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view. The bedroom bed (King-sized) makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. Of coarse, this isn't too bad once you fall asleep, until then, it sucks! In regards to room services, the hotel workers are not all that friendly. They talk to you in a stubborn way, as if they just want to get it done and over with, just to get their pay-check. Yes they do all basic room service orders, but it is not all too friendly. Overall, this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has (which is a bare minimum). With that being said, I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. However, if sub-par service and quality is okay for you, then this hotel could be suitable, however, considering it's prices, you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms."

After seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered, I booked my reservations right away. When I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. I was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. I was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. I took the elevator up to my room, and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable. After relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast, courteous service I received. After my cocktail hour, I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. I had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time. I highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did, and I can't wait to return. Ashley B."
1,"Bought this for our 11 lb. Lab. It is a little heavy for him, but he doesn't mind it. The bed is solid and is easy to clean. The material is nice and soft and it is easy to clean. The size is perfect for our pup. Great for the price. I have a German Shepherd and a German Shepherd mix. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one. It's very durable. I would recommend this for a German Shepherd. I love this food. I have been feeding it to my cats for about 2 years now."
1,"I recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel (Chicago Water Tower), and I was quite disappointed. I was excited by the great location (on East Chestnut Street downtown), but this was a mediocre hotel for the price ($250 per night before taxes). The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters, and yes, the view of downtown in the distance was pretty, but I was very disappointed. The bedding seemed to be polyester, not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately. When I ordered room service at 10:30 (on a Thursday night), I had to wait for 55 minutes, 20 minutes longer than I was quoted. I ordered a salad, and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long. Overall, I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower."

If anything, the section on how the collapse of WTC1 and WTC2 was made more clear with the explanations supplied with the excerpted footage from Explosive Evidence than Explosive Evidence itself.  Where this documentary fell down was in the omission of Silverstein's PBS interview where he freely admitted that WTC7 was deliberately imploded, which was one of the few actual pieces of evidence given in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Myth-and-The-Reality-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000VRF4C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11: The Myth and The Reality - 2 DVD Set</a>.  The other glaring issue was the allegation that pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma were running rampant in the wake of the destruction of WTC1 and WTC2.  Problem:  asbestos-induced interstitial fibrosis and mesothelioma have very clear latency times of 20 years after the date of first exposure.  If such an epidemic is to happen, it will not happen for another 45 months from the time this review is written.  Also, mesothelioma already occurs in 1/1,000,000 people each year WITHOUT prior asbestos exposure.  If these diagnoses in past cases are correct, there are some equally disturbing causes: either a) there was prior exposure well ahead of 9/11, or b) there are additional toxic materials not previously identified to the public used in the construction of WTC1 and WTC2."

The only complaint I have is that the boot is a little tight on my feet so I have to wear a size 4 to get them to fit. They're great shoes, I'm very happy with them and they are a great deal. They're just a tad narrow and I can't tell you how they feel until I wear them. Overall, I'm very pleased with the boots. I really love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit like a glove! I love the way they look! I ordered a size 8, and they fit perfectly. I love the color, too. I like how they have a buckle that is a little longer than I thought, which is great. I wear a size 8, and I wear a size 10, so I thought it would be a little longer for me."

There was merengue, reggaetone, cumbia, electronic, and African. Step workouts can be hard on the knees, but 4 inch doesn't bother me too much.

0,"Ordinary action flicks suffer from the affliction of predictability.  We all know that the gun wielding tough guy will systematically destroy all of his enemies and heroically beat the boss after a more difficult battle at the end.  If you are tired of these kinds of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead.  What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never ceases to be entertaining.  Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot.  So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away.  But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stakes of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire.  As you can see, it has all of the staples of an action flick.  Superb character development and visual effects make this a must-see action movie with a great plot twist."

0,"Let us, gentle reader, ignore this films failure as a sci-fi / religious movie and let us celebrate its triumph as the greatest comedy of all time. Imagine, for a moment that Jerry Falwel decides to make a film based the book of Job. Jerry casts himself as Job (in KISS make-up) then casts Adam West as the voice of God and the Olsen Twins as Satan. Add a soundtrack by The Bloodhound Gang featuring Cher and you begin to get a small idea of the unintentional hilarity that is Battlefield Earth. I had a few friends over to watch this and we had a blast (the alcohol helped...alot). Our favorite part was when former Sweat Hog John Travolta as the platform-boot wearing Terl hands over a machine gun to the hero (and I'm using that word in its broadest possible sense) Johnnie. Johnnie hands the gun BACK to Terl and then spends the rest of the movie trying to get his hands on MORE guns. ""Whattcha gonna do with those"", we screamed at the TV ""hand 'em over?"" And don't even get me started on the ""Human-animals like to eat rats"" part. Once in every generation a film this bad comes along - let us be thankful that we're here to enjoy it."
0,"So here is how this device operates.  The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.  If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.  There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.  The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.  Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.  This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used."

1,"If you have read the book, you know the basic gist of it, and the reader will understand what's going on in the story.  The basic idea is to take the reader on a journey into the world of the mind, and then read it with an open mind.  In other words, the reader is going to get a glimpse into the mind of a person who is not a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  The book is very useful, and a good introduction to the subject.  I highly recommend it, and recommend it highly, if you haven't already.  You will be fascinated by the work of A. L. Hall.  Hall has a lot of work to do, and this book will keep you on your toes.

1,"The good news is that this has the quality and power of a standard AA battery. It has a nice round shape and is easy to mount and use.

It's a little bigger than a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a more compact flashlight, this is the one. The price is great for this light. You can buy it for around $20 for about $100. You can't beat the price for a good flashlight. It's not as big as a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a compact flashlight, this is the one. I've had it for a while now and I have no complaints. The review is my honest opinion. I gave it 4 stars because I was skeptical of the light. I've read a lot of reviews that said they would not buy this light, but I'm skeptical of that. I don't know if this light is a flashlight, a flashlight, a flashlight, or a flashlight. I just want a flashlight that will last. I have a few other reviews that I would recommend. I will update this review after I get more information. This is a good product. It looks great and works great. I bought a second one for a larger room because I had a couple of 2s that were too small for the smaller one. It came with a pair of gloves and it works great. The price is a little high for a little and the price is not a big deal."

I am so glad that I read her comment because I got the right size for my 10 pound Yorkie- the snow coat is made of very good quality materials and is put together very well. My little guy was so warm in it that he didn't want to come inside the house all he wanted to do was play in the snow and my dog doesn't like the cold weather at all but in this snow coat all he wanted to do was play because he was warm in it. If your dog is over 10 lbs. this coat is not going to fit him or her, but if your dog is under 10 lbs. I highly recommend buying this snow coat for him or her.

My four year old is very interested in it and we have attempted to play with it several times. The felt puzzle pieces that create the roads come apart very easily. This causes many problems as one begins to construct the city unless you are very delicate. The city itself must be built on a flat surface, so no carpet. This is very challenging with my two year old around. Even if she wasn't there to knock things over, it seems like it would be difficult to play with the city once set up. It is not designed to be very sturdy."

They even work on my soft over-the-knee microfiber boots. I do, however, have 2 minor issues. The ""hook' mentioned in the description, is actually a loop of plastic. You would still need something like a hook to hang the boots off of a rod or another hook. The insert is also pretty slick and easily slides out of my boots, when I hold them by the loop.... so hanging from this loop may not be possible, to begin with. (Maybe I'm doing something wrong?) I ended up buying separate boot hangers and attached those to the boots AND inserts."

I'm a mystery lover myself but I didn't see any reason to get in a fuss about it. Any way I quite enjoyed this book.  The author did not commit any of the cardinal sins against the mystery form that I have run into in some recent novels.  A series of odd and mysterious deaths occurred in San Francisco. They come to the attention of Amanda Martin, a young gamer who plays with a series of young misfits and her grandfather, who raised her after her parents' divorce.  Her father is a homicide detective and her mother is a Barbie-esque healer.  As Amanda and her friends investigate her mother is emotionally involved with two very different men.  I liked Amanda and her coherts and really enjoyed the smooth writing.  In fact I hated to put the book down.  While I didn't think it was a five star read, I thought it was a good, solid four star effort."

0,"We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.  This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate. (1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it. (2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet. (3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in. (4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs). (5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.  (Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one."

With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this."

0,"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.  Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.  The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.  Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is."

If you read the package CAREFULLY it does IMPLY same quality as Egyptian cotton and lower states microfiber, doesn't exactly come out and say polyester.  Misleading product information.

0,"After much research (and waffling) I held my breath and ordered these bars along with the Sunlite Steel stem and was able to convert my craigslist 1986 Schwinn LeTour mixte to a fully upright riding position.  As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conversion that I cried.  Thank you other reviewers and bloggers...you gave me the courage to order the parts and the ability to finally sit completely upright.  My full review of the products together and process is on the Sunlite stem page...I don't want to bore with repetition.  I will say, the handlebars seem like very good quality to me.  I like the straight front which will accept a basket, and the grip part was long enough for my vintage Schwinn grips plus brake levers.  I have downtube shifters and, as others have noted, there is not enough room on the straight back portion to have grips, shifters, and brakes.  But it worked for me.  I did as another reviewer reported and angled the bars down a little, so my wrists are in their natural, straight alignment when on the grips.  Am loving the whole set up!  Thank you amazon and thank you reviewers!"
0,"I tried 2 from each container (4 total)  MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.  STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.  CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.  BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me. It looks like the good matches, but these are flimsy, inconsistent and unreliable."

0,"**UPDATED** I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!  If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.  I have been wearing it nearly every day since it arrived and have been quite happy with it."
0,"The Unique 2nd Birthday Latex Balloon 6-pack arrived very quickly from the seller in professional packaging.  The package included six 12-inch diameter latex balloons in various colors that were printed with ""Happy 2nd Birthday"".  The only challenge I have learned with purchasing balloons online is finding somewhere to get them inflated.  I was able to find a grocery store here in town to finally do it, but it was definitely more expensive than just purchasing from them or pretty much anywhere else.  These balloons were not expensive, it was the getting them inflated with helium that got costly.  I think it was like $1.60 per balloon.  Overall, the quality and appearance of the balloons was nice.  I would definitely recommend these balloons, but be forewarned that you may run into more expense than you anticipated with inflating them.  The inflating cost is not a problem with the balloons...just what you run into when trying to get them filled."

I've had it for about a year now and I love the fact that it's so easy to clean and dry.  I have had it for a few months now, and I'm not sure how long it will last.  The color is beautiful, and the texture is not too soft.  It's a very good size for my purposes."

First, it is translated into smooth modern English, which, while not conveying every subtlety of Greek, will nontheless help the present-day reader through this long work.

The notes, bibliography, appendices, indexes, timeline and glossary all make this a great resource for the student or casual reader. There is enough mention of content in all the other reviews. I just wanted to point out the advantages of this edition."

0,"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...  In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!  They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.  I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.  So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good."

It is not too big, but it is not too small either. I would definitely recommend this bed frame. I have a sister who has a baby, and she loves it.

1,"I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment, but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so. It was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel. First I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful. The apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service. He said we had not reserved a room, which I had weeks earlier, and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both. Finally the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents. He did straiten out the confusion, but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants. I called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place. We were shown to another room, this time to our liking. From that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had. To list just a few; the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels, the food that room service brought up was cold, lifeless and bland, the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room. To be blunt, I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff, guts the building thoroughly, and is publicly flogged in a downtown park. WE WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN."
0,"I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels, however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro. Even before my visit, concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see, and booked tickets in advance to Second City. We were welcomed warmly on arrival, and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel. All the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience. The hotel is next to City Hall, where I had some business. We had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. Enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty. And that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish, if you want attentive service, this is the place to be. Thank you, Hotel Allegro, for a great stay. I can't wait to return."

1,"I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago while in town for business, and enjoyed my stay very much. I stayed in a room with a king bed, which was very comfortable. The room had all the things I needed for my stay, which was nice. The only thing is I think there was a party on my floor, but they quieted down quickly enough. My room even had an internet connection! I also had dinner one night at the China Grill, and it was an amazing meal! Overall, I had a great stay, and will return next time I am in Chicago."

0,"I would rate this a 5 star tower if it hadn't arrived with a front grill with a rusted section.  It's right in the bottom right-hand corner so I'm sure when the fan lights up it will be painfully obvious.  It's only on the ""grill"" part so if the vendor could replace this piece for me I would gladly revisit my rating.  Photo attached.  It's worse in person because the flash from the camera washes it out a bit.  Update:  Vendor replaced front panel at no cost to me and without hesitation.  Amending review to 5 stars.  I've had the product for over 1 year and it's great.  I even bought a second one but with the USB 3.0 front input.  Both are fantastic.  I highly recommend and will buy more myself."

1,"Last week, I booked a 'Deluxe Suite' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago. I took the 'Retreat and Relax' package deal. The wait to check in was intolerably long, because they were letting some people check in with a dog. I'm allergic to dogs, and I'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. They insisted on escorting me to to my room, every time I came in, like I was going to break into another guest's room or something. I swear, anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks, asking me if I needed anything. You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something. I went to the pool, but it was full of screaming children. When I went to bed, I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. And what's worse, they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. They threatened to throw me out on the street, after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars! I had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it. Also, their on-site restaurant is too expensive, given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. The food should be free! I wouldn't stay here again, it was a waste of my money."

0,"The Gideon Affair  Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.  Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.  And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.  Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.  You will feel a variety of emotions reading this story but I promise you, you will enjoy every minute of it!"

0,"I love this hat. The styling is super cute, especially with the bow at the back. It seemed to fit about the same as most standard ladies hats of this type, possibly a little looser as I have a big head and tend to find most hats slightly small until they have been broken in and stretched. This fit well from the get-go. There is a slight amount of adjustability (there's a velcro closure by the bow on the back) but not much. The construction on it is solid and seems like it will hold up to a lot of wear - already been through the wash once after being thrown in a mud puddle and stepped on by my toddler, and it still looks good as new. I purchased the dark violet color - it's definitely not violet, more of a light tweedy brown - BUT it is the exact color that it shows on the computer screen. So ignore the words and go off of the picture :) Huge brim is great for the beach, reading, gardening, or just everyday wear to protect your face from the sun. Please note, the brim does NOT extend all the way around the back. It almost gives this hat more of a bonnet look than the oversized sun hats one often thinks of. I think this gives it more style, but if you're looking for something to also protect the back of your neck, this is not the hat for you. I love this hat and will be getting a lot of use out of it this summer!  I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

1,"My stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live. I was there for a week long conference. Although my reservations had been made months in advance, they did not have a suite for me when I arrived, resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night. Once my room was ready, I was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen: barely large enough to move around, and very few utensils to cook with. The pool was only open for limited hours, and I should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit. At night I was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside. My overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite. I will not book here ever again."

I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin, Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved. I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. I was extremely disappointed. I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name. Pros: Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location: Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments - Stained and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - Phone and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was $60 for two people, service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo, one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days, I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel. and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct.

0,"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading."

0,"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.  It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.  In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death."

0,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).  'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).  In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')  As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."

0,"This protractor has been a very good tool for reading and setting up angles.  The readout is a little off, so instead of reading the degrees, then setting the same angle on my miter saw, I use the protractor to physically set the angle of the saw blade.  The Starrett protractor is well built and is easy to use (other  than the problem noted above)."

0,"My rabbits are crazy about this food! I am wondering what the little orange shapes are in it because my boys are climbing all over me in the morning to get to them. They even dig through their dish to look for the mystery morsels. It's definitely something other than the actual pellet food in a different shape & color. Too bad there weren't more of these in the food, as I like to give them healthy treats once in awhile.  The stores where I usually purchase this bun food have stopped carrying it, and I am very happy that I found it on Amazon! My boys are even happier than I am! Timothy pellets are the best and healthiest for them, and most of the stores carry the alfalfa pellets or some junk with the first ingredient called ""wheat midlings."" I want my boys' urinary tracts to be healthy, not gunked up with calcium and other deposits.  Along with their daily greens and veggies, timothy grass/hay, they will always have their yummy Fori-Diet!"
0,These are the best chews for large dogs like masstiffs.  I would spend a lot of money on pet shop chews and they would be gone in a day. These are huge and last for about a month. Especially if the dog is a older puppy. My Bull Mastiff and Cane Corso love them. I get two a month. Good for them too.
1,"I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel. It was my first time staying at this hotel and, I am sorry to say, it was my last time staying there. One of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. The walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. Although I could not quite make out the words of their conversations, I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. In addition, I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door, presumably on the way to their rooms. Admittedly, I am a light sleeper, but this was ridiculous. If you decide to stay here, I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. When I checked mine, I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged. I had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me (and the front desk service is woefully slow) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. Finally, though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated, I cannot believe that statement was accurate. The room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. All in all, I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. Next time I will arrange to stay elsewhere."

1,"If you are traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay, I highly recommend the Hotel Allegro Chicago. It was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro. He said they were pet friendly,which was a huge plus. This is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business. Upon my arrival, I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered. I walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after. The lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in. After I had entered and checked in, I saw the staircase, which looked like a testament to the staircase in the 'Titanic'. Frankly, I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet. My room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing. The bed had a blue headboard,which I have never seen before, and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there. The room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered. Later I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312, which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. These are the specifics of my stay, but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro. In summary, they allow pets, the service is amazing, the decoration superb, and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. What more could a person ask for?"
1,I ran into this one a few years ago and decided I needed to make a purchase. I bought this movie because it's a must see for the whole family. I love this movie and I look forward to the next installment. This is a very good movie. The acting is great. The storyline is good and the directing is great.

It's really very cool.  Pros: Very detailed and well made. Great variety of fairies, dragons, horses, unicorns, and attachable wings.  Cons: Strong smell outta the package. Like an oil/lubricant/plastic smell. It made me a little sick to my stomach. Some of the wings didn't fit the horses well."

1,"***I received a free product from an Amazon seller and they sent me a free gift! I'm very pleased with the quality and the design.  The ring itself is solid and strong and is comfortable to wear.  The outside is a bit thick for my size 4.  The material is soft and comfortable to wear.  I also love the fact that it is a little longer than I expected.  I wear it to keep my hands warm and warm with a good amount of circulation.  I also like that the ring is smaller than I expected.  I also like the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside of my hand.  I'm not a big fan of the padding on the inside, but I don't like the fact that it's less than an inch.  I don't have to worry about the padding going up a bit in the middle of the day, but I do have to be careful of the texture.  I'm not a big guy and I'm not sure what's going on inside the ring.  I don't like that it's a little more than an inch, but I like that it doesn't feel like it's going to get any bigger than I was expecting.

0,"I recently got this HTC Portamate PM1000 mobile base and a Delta 50-345.  The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base."

0,"I bought the x-large, as it was cheaper than the large at the time, so figured, why not?  This thing is seriously massive and heavy; too large and heavy for my chocolate lab to comfortably hold in her mouth.  She doesn't show much interest in it, but I'm not sure if it is the design/flavor, or just the massiveness of it; however, if you have a strong-chewer, you can't beat Nylabones!  They are nearly indestructible.  I still have some from 2 labs ago...that's about 20+ years a few of these bones have lasted!  I have NEVER had to throw one away because it was chewed up.  Only had to replace them because others have been lost.  P.S. - if your dog has this in its mouth standing near your feet, you'd better be wearing steel-toed boots!"

1,"Temple of Doom is infamous for its suave, yet violent scenes.  The film has a weak plot.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little too much of a hack job.  This movie is still fun to watch.  The only problem with this movie is that the monsters are too scary to be scary.  They're just too big to be scary.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the voice acting.  You'd think that a scary monster would be scary, but it's a little too scary to be scary.  The movie is probably the best part of the movie, especially if you like zombies and vampires.  It's just too scary to be scary.  If you're a fan of the film, then this is probably the movie for you.  You can't go wrong with this one.  You can't go wrong with this one.  I'm not going to say anything about the other films, just say that it's a good movie.I am a huge fan of the series.

1,"The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has it all: location, comfort, and rockability! We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently and found it to be amazing! The location was perfect as it is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and Lake Michigan. It was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums, Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science and Industry! The food, although it was pricey, was great! There is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin', and if you have pets, they get the ROYAL treatment, complete with gifts! I would highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel of Chicago!"

I'm using this with a Nikon D5100.  I can't disagree with the comments regarding some of the limitations, but for what I do it is great for me.  Here's a shot I took the other day [...]  I'll add that I got this at my local camera shop. They got the Nikon mount in before Amazon did."

They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.  I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed. I was able to put it together by myself in about 45 minutes.  It's bigger than I expected it to be, but it will be worth it for happy birds."

A lot of mental illness and people treated pretty badly.  Does this all really happen?  Well, I guess probably so, but I don't want to read about it.  I must say this author writes really really well, but her subject matter does not appeal to me."
0,"While overall a decent property, the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights, checking out on Monday, March 19th. Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. The garage manager, Mike Yunan, didn't call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, Marco Scherer. When he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an 'incident report' and claim with his insurance company, Travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. In the end, this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. In the end, do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible."

I liked that they were both in their own right.  The ending was sweet and sweet.  The writing was great.  I liked the fact that they were both in their own right.  I also liked that the ending had a happy ending.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I wanted to know what the future holds for them.  I was disappointed with the ending.  I think it would have worked better if the next book was not as dramatic.  I was left wanting more.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance.I've read all of the 3 books in this series.  I have no idea how to put them down.  I was really excited to read this book.  I love this series, and I can't wait to read the next one.  This is a very good book.  I don't want to give away anything, but I will say that the story is well written, and I loved it.

It is a bit tight, but that's to be expected since its new. Beats having to pay $100+ for a handyman or locksmith to come out and replace.

0,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!  To see what N.K.'s idea behind Brandon's reflection was head over to the HEA blog!"

She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.  I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!  The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.  I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first."

0,"This film is so entertaining and so cool, a great tribute to 70's Westerns and Martial Arts films. Just watching Uma Thurman in her yellow outfit similar to Bruce Lee's in his unfinished project ""The Game of Death"" has to bring back memories for Martial Arts movie fans everywhere. The fight things are spectacular, the Japanise anime complements the movie very well, the music is great,even the dialogues are fun to watch, an unusual thing for action movies these days. You can even know that the actors are having a good time playing their roles. Chapter Five called ""Showdown at House of Blue Leaves"" in which The Bride stalks O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu)with the 5,6,7,8's music playing in the background(fun music)and then gets in a sword fight with her gang in order to get to her is the best action sequence I have seen in years. It's fast paced, violent, intense, cartoonish, fun, just great!!. This is not a must see, It's a MUST OWN for every action fan."

0,"From the very beginning of this series, I knew that Gretchen de la O had given us a gem. What I hadn't expected was the respectful, slow and magical transition from YA to more Adult. You literally feel like you are growing up with Wilson Mooney, our heroine of the series.  In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.  The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.  However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.  A beautiful series written for the hopeless romantic in all of us, Gretchen does not disappoint with the HEA and delivers a book boyfriend the teenage girl and young lady in all of us dreamed existed."

The low rating is for the ridiculously complex and counter-intuitive programing which renders it essentially useless beyond the basic function of telling the temperature remotely.

0,"I was cleaning out some boxes of children's books, keeping what I consider classic while giving the rest to my grandchildren or to the libraries. I doubled-back between this current edition and the previous editions to make sure this was the same one...it is, and I highly recommend this. I took a class in children's literature back in the 70's and I fondly remember it as being one of the most enjoyable classes I had in college the first time around. This book lasted through my children's growing up and is now going through new useage with my grandchildren. I love the way this book is organized. If you have a child with specific interests such as limericks (and I know few children who don't get a kick out of limericks) you can go to that section without delay. I grew up with Joan Walsh Anglund poignant drawings. They are not particularly 'great' art, but for children and in this book, they are vastly more suitable than the poorly drawn and maddening stuff put out in cartoons (especially of the Pokemon variety which will set off seizures in children). They say the age of this book is for four years to eight year olds. That isn't true. Every parent should try to take the time to read to all children in whatever form necessary...and it should start at age one. Reading aloud (or signing books) to your children not only makes essential bonds, but it also teaches children what you think is important, and also teaches them how to stop and pay attention. The massive complaints about restless children and the abuse of labeling (ADD/ADHD) has its beginnings in simple things such as turning the television/computers off and reading to your children. ... should be showing the pictures and pages of this book in a sampling, so that parents can make informed decisions about children's books. If you only get one child's book this year, get this one and sit down with your children and read. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"

0,"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.  Pros: 1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets 2) A cute penguin theme  Cons: 1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What might fix this is to have both sides be magnetic: one side - game board, one side - staging area. And put the game options on harder cardboard that flip out the top and bottom.  2) The solutions. I wish they were somehow hidden or in another section. I've worked with my kid on ""it's not as much fun if you don't figure it out on your own"" but once he figured out that the solutions were in the back - he just spent his time copying the solutions. I don't even know how to address this one - I gave him to toy to entertain him while we were setting up and breaking down camp and for the car, in lieu of a screen, so I couldn't sit there and play with him."

1,"My family and I were in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice, but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel. The hotel appeared very nice, and to have all the amenities: Room service, WiFi, clean rooms. Unfortunately, as it turned out, appearances can be deceiving. It begins at the desk, where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring. He said they didn't have any rooms available because we didn't make arrangements. It was getting late, and we had no place to go, there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. I asked if there was anything he could do, and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy. I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing, the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night. Apparently, our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard, because this room wasn't even clean and the wifi didn't work. We ordered room service, and it never came, even after several complaints. It doesn't end there either; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service. Overall, this was a very frustrating experience, and I wouldn't stay there again."

0,"We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend, and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived. Is it just me, or is this information not clearly stated on their website? A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming. The room itself was fine. More bland and generic than the 'European elegance' claimed on their website. The lack of hot water, was definitely not fine though. There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel. The location is good, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. These few good points certainly did not redeem our experience, and I wouldn't pick this place again, even post-construction."

0,"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.  The good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you.

0,"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on. Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toes is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose. Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly. Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it was slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect.  But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issues I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling.  I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my feet hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issues (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my soles is preicous, and when my upperfoot aches (the bones), having less constriction as this style provides helps.  The style is a bit matronly, so don't expect the height of fashion. Just nice support and comfort for troubled soles."

0,"We have been looking FOREVER it feels like for a good, durable outdoor table that will store away. It is great for kids. DEFINITELY will not hold the weight of an adult though, which was a little disappointing... we had our sons birthday party and he wanted me to sit with him and it about broke before I even put all my weight on it and I'm only 130. I don't think it would honestly hold more than 4 kids unless some sat on the joints. It held fine when my son (40lbs) sat on one bench but when his friend sat next to him (30 lbs) it began to creak and bend. The table top itself is a lot more sturdy. Our dog (60lbs) likes to lay on the table with our puppy (50lbs) and no bending or anything. Overall good buy, a little bit of a pain to put together but worth it for the safety factor."

0,"Its funny how the internet, most especially the social media has become a crucial thing in our lives that it can even affect a relationship. Now a days, it has become one of the common reasons why a lot of things go wrong, even why a man would not want to commit (Read the book and you would understand what I mean). It was a wonderful book, although written for women to get their man committed. It was not at all one-sided."

0,"Excellent pair of leggings! Much warmer than regular leggings which may be because of the ribbing. The elasticity is excellent, they are a great length also! I am only 5'2 so they are a bit long but I just cuff the bottom under and it's fine!  I know that taller women often have issues finding leggings of a decent length but these would be great if you are taller! The color is not a dark black but more of a smoky black. Super comfy and the pockets are an added plus so they look more like pants but have the elastic waistband of leggings. The first pair I ordered had a tiny hole on the leg but I messaged Amazon and received a replacement pair within 2 days without having to return the others first! So I am very pleased!"

0,"This book is so, so good.  I wish I had known about this series before, but I will definitely being going back to catch up on all the books I have missed.  This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.  Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.  With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.  I received an eARC of this book compliments of the publisher in exchange for my honest review and opinon.  All ratings and opinions stated are my own."

You just aren't going to find a Mil/Mil FFP scope with usable glass at this price from anyone else.  The picture is bright, clear, and distortion free. The reticule is straight, perfectly centered, and sharp. The turrets are very good, with the smallest amount of wiggle but nothing that matters. The whole thing is very solid, with firm, positive adjustment at the eyepiece.  At the highest powers you do get a bit of haze, but nothing that renders it unusable. The range I usually shoot at is frequently overcast, and even in less than ideal light I've never had a problem with contrast, even with the magnification set to maximum (14x).  It has held zero through approximately 900 rounds of .308 with no signs of problems.

0,"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area."

0,"I bought this to replace a WD 750GB Black that had a SMART predictive failure after about 2 years use.  I have about equal appreciation for both these drives.  The WD was cheap and served well.  I've replaced many hundreds of drives in my career so I don't particularly get upset about the occasional failure and wouldn't characterize the product by a single experience.  Obviously in the case of the Seagate I haven't owned it long enough to know whether it will last longer or not.  It's worked for almost a month now and seems similar in performance which is quite high for a laptop drive.  I also have a SanDisk SSD which I am a little disappointed in simply because for practical purposes there is no performance advantage compared to these much less expensive and much higher capacity hard drives.  For a tablet or ultrabook I would go SSD, but for a mostly desk-bound laptop, these 750GB drives seem to work great."

0,"Book #48 Read in 2013 The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty  This book tells the story of three women:  Rachel, Cecilia and Tess, and how they are connected in ways that are unknown even to them. Rachel's daughter was murdered as a teenager. Cecilia is feeling unsatisfied with her normally perfect life as wife and mother. Tess's husband has fallen in love with her cousin, so she packs up her young son and goes back home to her mother's. All three women are dealing with tons of issues, to varying degrees of success. These women are interesting and complex. There is a decent mystery plot to this book to keep readers engaged. At times this book is a tad predictable but that did not take away enjoyment from reading it. I liked Moriarty's book What Alice Forgot so I chose this one from Amazon Vine to review.

The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.   At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."

The second half of the movie is a very dark movie, with the viewer experiencing a ""good"" ending. The only thing that I found in the film was that it was a very dark movie"

1,"First of all, I have a hard time understanding the purpose of this book, and I don't understand why so many people are making such a negative impression on it.  The author does a good job of describing the history of the Civil War, but it's not as well written as the other books in the series.  I also don't understand the desire to see how the Civil War played out in the United States, as it is.  I don't understand why so many people want to see the end of the Civil War, as it is.

0,"The location of this hotel is excellent. The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. The room decor is horrible (probably more European than I am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. On the upside, if you want to stay in a great location, feel safe, and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. I prefer Westin or Marriott...something that you can count on."

1,The theme of the story is an island with a distinct history.  There is a strong sense of self-worth and commitment.  There is also the sense of humor.  There is a sense of adventure and romance.  The story is told in a way that gives you the feeling of
1,"I been a big fan of Greg and the Kinsey series since I read them in order.  I read them in order.  I also have the Tween series, and it's just as good.  I have a feeling that there are going to be some new series for the Kinsey books as well.  I also have the last book in the series, which is a good book for the Kinsey fans.  The Kinsey books are a good read"
0,"This book was enjoyable and an entertaining read.  It was nice in that the book engaged me and took my mind off of anything other than the book while I was reading it.  I chose this book after seeing the cover for the latest Maisie Dobbs story and liking the picture wanting to know more.  I decided to start with the first book in the series after reading reviews by other readers and a few professionals.  I enjoyed the transition from the curreny mystery back into Maisie's background to help develop her character which added some mystery itself.  The shift back to the mystery at the end tied everthing together nicely.  I am encouraging my wife to read the book and share it with her book club.  I will likely read more of the Maisie Dobbs series."

1,"Count Dracula is to my mind a master story, and I will admit that I thought this one.  But the film is a bit too long, and the first half is pretty much just a matter of time.  I would have liked to have seen more of the story, but I felt that it was just too long, and had to wait a bit for the second half.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a long film, and not for those who have never seen Dracula before, but for those who know that it is indeed a beautiful story, and will watch it over and over.  It is not too long, and it is filled with good ideas, and the characters are believable.  Overall, this is a good film, and I recommend it to everyone who has seen Dracula before, and for those who have"
0,"Another great book by Ms Miller.  This was a different setting for this story, not being in cowboy country but she did really well in San Francisco and Portland.  Really wish this was just the first of a series."
0,Good product and works well.  But only the squirrels and birds are liking it so far.  No deer as of two weeks.
1,This book does NOT disappoint. I love the characters and the storyline. The characters are awesome. There is a lot of angst and drama but the story is so great. The story is well written and the characters are strong. I would recommend this book.
1,"James Chicago; the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised. I didn't want stay in this hotel, but my wife insisted. Ok, so when I booked the ticket, it cost me $299 for one room. $299! I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point! The room was stylish though, it looked nice. There was a TV, and the beds were fine. Although I couldn't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer. Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer? What were they thinking!? The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected. I mean the food available there wasn't very tasty at all. I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet, but they had no computer, only wifi. That's like only having bread, without any fillings to make it into a sandwich!"
1,"Received Arc from Author for an honest review.  I really enjoyed this book. It has a lot of heart and a lot of love. The characters are great. The story is well written and well told. I would definitely recommend this book.I really enjoyed this book. The characters were strong and likable. I found myself rooting for the main character to overcome her past issues. I was rooting for the story to keep going and on and on. It was very refreshing to have a new author get to know the characters. I liked the fact that she got to know them a little better. I am looking forward to reading more from this author.This was a very good book. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to reading more about the family.I like how it was a good start to a series.  I look forward to reading more.This was a really good read.  It was not a bad book, but it was not the end of the world.  It just left me hanging.  I was waiting for the next book, so I would be looking forward to this one.  I will definitely be reading more by this author.  I look forward to reading more."
0,"Ahh, Kennedy even for a Dom he really was a sweetie! I'm sure he wouldn't like to be thought of as a sweetie, but his actions says otherwise.  Dar/Mackenzie, she was a strong businesswoman, with an independent mind, she knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go for it. Her visit to the Hub, although not her first was interesting, she definitely got more than she had bargained for.  I loved her group of friends, Bella was a good friend, as was Mackenzie in return.  Kennedy had a strong group of friends too; in Julien, Reece and Grant.  We already know Reece's story and I'm sure Grant and Julien's are going to be Fab.  Although they were together for Reece's bachelor party, they really had Kennedy's back.  As eccentric as Julien is, he helped Kennedy see sense and made him realize he had been a fool.  As did Bella with Mackenzie, I loved the interaction between Mackenzie and her neighbor and his dog, she has a really caring nature.  The sexy scenes were fab, and I needed to fan myself more than once, not to mention other forms of relief :) !  I felt that although the story ended on a very good positive note, it would be great to have seen how they got on with the moratorium they had agreed to.  Looking forward to finding out more about Julien or will it be Grant in the next book.  Love your work Sierra !"
