0,"If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great."
0,"Porter was a hard character to like when we find out the exact nature of the relationship with AJ. Ill be honest and say I wanted to see him have a pay back moment for all he has done to AJ.  We get some of that, I still felt bad for him though. His actions were awful but, he was broken.  Mackenzie was broken in other ways. I felt for her. They had an emotional journey. One that was worth it in the end. *** I voluntarily read an advanced readers copy of this book****"

1,"I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughter's wedding. Nina (Our Daughter) stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched! Well I don't understand why at all. Upon arrival we checked in and met Nina at the 'The Bar' (how innovative) and had a light supper. The food was like airline food and cold. The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet. When he finally came with the check we thought 'our light supper' was all too pricey. Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8:00 PM sharp. Not sharp enough. At 8:15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldn't be able to meet with us tonight. Well that is just great. Over $300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted. No more money will be spent here, I will Guarentee that. Sincerely Mr. and Mrs. Scott Grander Louisville, KY"

0,"My husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night. I called the hotel and spoke with Eric, he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation, he said no and that was the end of it. My husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookit.com as well. I called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement. I informed courtney from bookit.com that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by Eric. She spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name. I got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he 'didnt recall' saying that. I was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied!!!!!!!!!!! He said, no ma'am i dont remember saying that. I said so since you dont remember thats it??? I said my husband heard him say it b/c he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there. I asked to speak to Erica, told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on. I asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth. I have never writte. A review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this.

0,"I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work! I would not recommend buying this bottle."
1,"So, this is the second time I have used it. I did not need to purchase a full sized (or extra large) bag, but I figured if I wanted to take it on a trip, I would. It is a perfect size for my needs and I can carry it for the day. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do. The other review I have read said the handle is too small. I was worried this might be because the handle is so small, but it is not. It is a bit too thick for my liking. I would recommend to others if you are using a different handle for it. I was able to find some great reviews from others who said they were able to use this for some serious activity. I have not tried this handle yet, but I hope to. I have a 5 year old and this is the handle I would recommend to her. She has no problems with it. I would recommend this for anyone. I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", 170lbs. She loves it and has had it for about a year. She has been using it a lot and is happy with it. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is the color of the logo."

I paid a little more for this than I normally would for a similar mug thinking I was getting something special, but other than the artwork it is just a cheap travel mug.  The words ""America"" and ""American"" appear about a dozen times on the packaging, along with words like ""authentic"" and ""pride."" Apparently American Expedition takes pride in America, just not enough to have their products made here."
0,"I am impressed with the quality and durability of these cat toys. I bought the first one, single speed, then this one with variable speeds. They both have features I like and also things I think could be improved, but they don't shut themselves off every time the cat stops it like some do (a good thing!), and its very quiet except for an enticing little sound it makes sometimes, kind of like a squirrel chirping only not that loud. I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off. My cats tend to do a lot of watching and some active playing with them. At least it keeps them occupied some of the time!"
0,"This is a beautifully-written book by a highly literate author who has a respect for the written word. No gimmicks, no hype, nothing that's cheap about the all-important subject of coming of age...how refreshing! Reading the chapter titles alone is stimulating, because you get a glimpse of the structure of the book without being told the exact details (which of course, entices you to want to see how the story plays outs).  The realism of the book draws the reader in effortlessly. The journey is epic and dramatic without being formulaic or repetitious. There are many poignant lines throughout the content too, which give the book added depth and insight. I think the following line (from one of the chapters in The Same Moon) describes the book very well: ""Life was no film set, and there was no script."" I particularly enjoyed Chapter Five: The Courtship for its unabashed view on ""the dating game.""  As someone who enjoys culture and travelling, this book was certainly a treat. The strength of books like these is that they remind discerning readers how literature is differentiated from the film medium. While the latter tends to be more impressive in terms of 'visuals', good literature is intimate because it engages the reader through a one-on-one experience. That is one of the things I enjoy the most about reading, which The Same Moon delivers."

0,We loved our stay at the Talbott. We were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing. We booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount. When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. We were upgraded to a King bed suite. The suite was well decorated and spacious. My wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. We loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago. Highly recommended.

1,"I've never written a review before, but I just had to share my experience with Chicago's InterContinental Hotel. I booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife's birthday. We've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us. The horrors started when we first got to the counter. The clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me. We get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet! We had to wait around for that, so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. Finally our room is finished and the the 'view' we were promised was non-existent. To top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning. The toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain. A stain! on the sheets. What a waste of money. I pointed this out the concierge and we weren't even offered a refund or discount. Never again."

0,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.  We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.  Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.  Update 10/18/13:  After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop."

0,"This is the one flashlight you need for all occasions.  Is it bright?  Eye-popping bright!  5 modes including an SOS signal. Only 6"" long, so can fit in a back pocket OK.  Waterproof, although I haven't tested this feature.  Requires just one battery, which happens to be a size 18650 not found readily in the USA.  (But can be ordered with charger from Amazon.) I am really impressed with these CREE LED flashlights.  Forget about the 9-LED flashlights, and any old-model incandescent flashlights!  They just don't compare at all to these CREE lights. WOW!  Amazon ships directly from China; about 2 weeks for delivery.  Always well packaged.  btw, buy extra batteries."

1,"These locks are very rugged and have the quality and durability of a steel lock. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The locks are easy to install and work great. They are hard to open and close, they can be easily opened and closed. The locks also work well with the bathroom door opener. I have had no issues with these locks so far. They are very bright and easy to use. I am very pleased with these locks. I have had them for about a month now and the light is very strong. They are very bright and I have them on my desk and in my work bag so they don't get lost. I would recommend these locks to anyone looking for a well made lock. I bought these to replace my old faucets and they are great!  I have used them for almost a month now and they are well made and have a very good feel to them. I have used them for many different projects and I am very happy with them."

1,"We will not be back to this hotel. There are several reasons for this, but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. The room was OK, but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly, and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. They didn't offer any other solutions. The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. Overall, we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago."

It is made of very thin material and has a nice feel to it.  He says that it is very lightweight and very easy to use.  The included bench does not seem to hold up well to the use.

It will keep you interested from beginning to end.I enjoyed the series. I love a good mystery with a good twist. I can't wait to see what happens next. I liked the ending. I'm not sure if the next book will be a good one.I have read all of her books and I really enjoy them.  They are about a young woman who has a bad reputation and wants to work for the country.  Her boss, who is a military man, is a guy who does everything to get her into trouble.  She has a few friends and a dog named Paul.  They have a great story line and I would recommend them to anyone.I was really excited to read this book.  I love this series, and this author is a great writer.

0,"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.  Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.  Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.  In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol."

The one I had was a bit large and not the best. It is a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I was able to get it to fit my new Sony A50 camera and it works great.

0,"No General ever won a war by dying for his country, he won it by making his enemies die and then coming home to die a few months later in a car crash. Sadly that was the fate of the real general Patton. The movie is a first rate film about one of America's most controversial Generals. I can't say I liked everything Patton did, but he was living in a world wide inferno of a hell on earth so I think he did better than most would have in his position. Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for Patton and I was deeply impressed by the style. It captured the general's character extremely well. The acting of George C. Scott was above reproach. The blu-ray edition was high definition awesomeness. All in all it was a terrific film and a worthy addition to any avid film buffs collection, ""ahem""."

Every conceivable amenity is available from the 42' plasma flat-screen to both wired and wireless internet connections available I was able to stay in constant contact with the office all while in the enviable lap of luxury.

0,I am giving it 4 Stars for Now. I have not used it yet. That being said. I paid $9. 95 for a Saws-all from Harbor Freight. it lasted for 3 yrs of constant use. then I gave it to a friend. lolo. People who do not know how to use one. unskilled home owner. can ruin the BEST most EXPENSIVE tool on the Market. When cutting. push the Saw all the way down on the FOOT and apply adequate pressure to keep it there as sawing. do not FORCE the SAW too hard to make the cut. Watch out for BLADE BINDING by the Material you are cutting starts pinching the blade. you can burn the Motors out by too much MUSCLE forcing it down thru the cut. or binding the blade!. I will update after using my Saw. They are a great tool don't know what I would do without one!!!!. Cheers. Tim.

1,"On a recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millemmium Park Hotel I was appalled at the service I received at such a supposedly high end hotel. When I arrived I had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in. Apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with. Finally I was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area. Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight. And the room was obviously a room for smokers. The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke. I, of course complained, but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel. After a fitfull night's sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway. Their parents were no where in sight. My shower was cold and had no pressure. I was given two towels one of which had not been laundered. I could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it. I cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark."

I was concerned about the shoe's durability, but it's not really worth it.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because they are very comfortable and they are a little longer than I expected.  I wear them a lot and they fit my feet perfectly.  I am very pleased with this purchase.My son is a half size 6, he loves it, but it was a little tight on him.

The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying. It wasn't until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue. Ten minuets later she found our reservation. Our room wasn't ready, we were told that it would be ready at noon; we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty! Room was very small. The bathroom shower, sink and floor were filthy. Room service trays sit in the hallways all day. The next morning we called down to get towels, they were never brought to the room, we had to drip dry. The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher. He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub."

This is a very well made flashlight.  I was also very disappointed with the battery. The charger is not a very good quality, the battery compartment is very small and it is a little hard to get it to charge. The battery compartment is not strong enough to hold an 8 cell battery, so if you have a battery that is not strong enough, it will not last long. I am still looking for a replacement battery.  I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands. It is a great flashlight for those who want to carry around a flashlight.It is very good for this price.  It does not have the finish of the original."

0,"I have been on Eugene Peterson kick recently. The more books that I read from him, the more I am drawn to his writing. He is wise, earthy, and poetic, a wonderful combination. Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination (1988) was the most recent.  In Reversed Thunder, Peterson explores the creative and imaginative language of St. John in the last book of the Bible. In my experience, many books about the Revelation of John attempt to provide a key to the events of the book as a type of apocalyptic road map. In other words, many books claim to have found the key to the end times and are eager to share their findings. This book is refreshingly different.  In the introduction, Peterson wrote, ""I do not read the Revelation to get additional information about the life of faith in Christ. I have read it all before in law and prophet, in gospel and epistle. Everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the previous 65 books of the Bible...I read the Revelation not to get more information, but to revive imagination."" Later: "" I have taken the position that this book does not primarily call for decipherment, as if it were written in code, but that it evokes wonder, releasing metaphors that resonate meanings and refract insights in the praying imagination.""  To be honest, this is the first thing I have read about the book of Revelation that I have actually benefited from, actually enjoyed. Peterson, a poet in his own write, writing about the poetry of St John is a lovely gift. If you are someone who has been confused by the book of Revelation, I would commend Reversed Thunder to you.  It is well worth the time."

0,"A longtime fan of the author, I was thrilled to see this book in the Vine program. I love Gabby's upbeat, positive, yet no-nonsense and very realistic voice. She tells it like it is, breaking down her lessons, and her life, into small meaningful chapters which pull the reader in and carry him or her through to the lesson and the meaning. This book isn't the ""pollyanna think and you'll be happy"" refrain that some authors offer. Instead, Gabby brings you into the harsh light of day, giving real life examples to the lessons, and honestly, and sometimes painfully sharing aspect of her life which a lesser person might have kept hidden.  Gabby is an inspiration to all of us spirit junkies out there, the meaning to keep trying and carry on, yet she challenges the reader to change, to look at her life in a new way, and in the end, Spirit Junkie will take the reader on a journey of introspection, transformation, and love."

1,"The 12 in headband is perfect for the wide brim. I also love that it's been waterproof.  I had to replace the band with a different one, so it should work better.  The only issue I have is that it's not very secure. If you have a large headband, you can't keep it in place. If you have a smaller headband, it might be a little easier to keep it in place.  I'm very happy with this purchase. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to wear when she was a little boy.  They work great.  The only negative is that the straps are a bit tight around the ears.  They're not.  It's a bit too tight for my daughter and I.  We'll see how it holds up.Great for our kids."
0,"O.k so people your right this one doesn't measure up to other Disney animated classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", but then again maybe that is not such a bad thing.  Anyone remember the little disaster in-a-box from 1996 ""Humpback?"" No well then count yourself blessed and spared by the divine hand of God  It was bad. This movie was not bad, not at all in fact I rather enjoyed it.  The storyline was solid if not wholly original and the graphics were great, sorta reminded me of Titan A.E only this movie got me to laugh once in a while whereas Titan A.E didn't.  The voice actors also seemed to have a fun time with what they were doing. The thing that killed this movie and why it so poorly at the box office was just the shear number of Treasure Island movies out there.  I'm sure that if this move had been a wholly orginal idea it would have been a box office smash, but unfortunately it was not. If you have the opportunity to but this one go ahead and do it.  This movie will surly keep both you and the kids interested.  On the plus side for adults the annoying singing is kept to a minimum"
1,"My stay at the Hilton was like living in luxury for a few days. I never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel. During my stay I could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge. In fact, they didn't charge for WIFI, morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service. The lobby always had complimentary coffee, tea, soda and meals! I felt like a queen. This hotel deserves highest marks for service."
0,"Extremely well packaged. Very thick outside box, then another inside box, thick cardboard protection top and bottom. On the small side but I knew that. Step for lid works very well and does not tip even when empty. Soft closing lid is nice also. Must use the plastic liner as the bottom is not solid but that is no issue for me since I wanted something that would not rust from my empty, but wet, contact lens packs. Update:  Been several months now and although it sounds foolish, this is one of my favorite items ever purchased on Amazon. The plastic liner is very simple to remove and dump and clean if needed. I do not feel a need to use a plastic bag. The lid opens and closes softly and smoothly each and every time. No need to keep your foot on the pedal to lower the lid."
1,"Quite honestly these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  They have a nice feel to them and have the best support I've ever had.  I'm a 4.5 with a medium build and these are a perfect fit.  I wear them all the time.  They are comfortable and have a great arch support.  I have had several pairs of these shoes.  I would recommend them to anyone.I love these boots. They fit well and are very comfortable.I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it fits great!Very nice and comfortable, but the strap is a bit long."

It has been dropped, thrown, drug, bounced, tossed, tickled, abused, hit, kicked, stood on, and fought over on a daily basis.

However, if you are nuts like me you can rest assured knowing that your iPad will survive anything your kids can throw at it."

1,"The Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel. There are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms, Lakeside view or suites. It only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. You will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return! The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. The casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. Next time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere."

1,"These boots are BEAUTIFUL...in the style of the Bootcamp. I will be purchasing more in other colors.I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him.  He ordered a size XL and it fit perfectly!  I did have to wash the boots on several occasions so I could get them dry before I put them on.  They are very soft and comfortable, and I'm very happy with them.  I'd definitely recommend these boots to anyone.  I was just pleased to find these boots at a good price.  The boots are very comfortable, and the arch support is good too.  I wear a size 10 and they fit perfectly.  I like how they have a foam sole and cushioning, but I have no problems with the shoe.  They look good on him, and I'm hoping they will last a long time.  I'm not a fan of the leather of the boots, but they are very soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as I expected.Great, very comfortable, and I ordered the white/tan color.  I don't have any problems with this particular model.  It is very comfortable and fits great.  I am 5'2"" and 125lbs and it's perfect for me."

I will be buying another one for my two cats. I have 2 cats and I will keep them in the house and on the couch so they don't get lost in the house. I am not sure if it will last long, but I have not had any problems with the cage. I am very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend this cage. I have used it for a couple of years now and it is very sturdy. The cage is a bit small for my 18 lb. Yorkie and I had to go in with my other cat. I have used this cage for a few months now and it has held up well."
0,"I could certainly relate to the title character who's plagued by the superficiality of her new life in the ""hip"" suburbs. The author really captures the banal issues, social competition and gossipy habits of people with a little too much money and time on their hands. Fun while I was reading it, but didn't give it a second thought afterwards."
1,The PERFECT shoe!!!! I've been wearing these shoes for about a month now and they have held up just fine. I had to replace a pair of shoes that had been worn a lot and that had broken in. I have a pair of size 9. 5 and they are very comfortable. They are not very long and I have worn them over and over with a pair of shoes. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an athletic shoe. I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them.

0,"My daughter - 2.5 years old - loves new toys and is usually a big fan of ones that interact with her.  She was not terribly impressed with this doll and neither was I.  The biggest feature of this doll is supposed to be that it giggles and laughs when you bounce and spin her.  In reality, you have to get very forceful (borderline abusive) in order to get her to ""react.""  I was concerned by the level of force my toddler needed to use to get a reaction, and I did not in any way want to encourage that level of forceful activity with her toys, especially considering that we are adding a new baby to the family soon.  Baby Alive went to the back of the closet and there have been no requests for her return as of yet.  We will probably simply remove her batteries and reintroduce her as ""just"" a cuddly baby doll."

0,"Honestly, I was very disappointed with this book. I thought since I absolutely loved 'the lovely bones' that this would be another amazing read but I was wrong. The story line had the potential to be a good book but it really just fell flat. It was an extremely slow and excruciating read and the flash backs were not seperated well from the here-and-now in the story. The characters left no lasting impact and overall the book was one that would not leave a trace of recognition in my mind. In a few years I may see the spine of this book on the very bottom of my bookshelf and I will have forgotten I've even read it. That's how much of an impact it left on me."

The carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way. The furniture was worn and outdated. The place was gross and just wasn't worth the money we spent on it. The only redeeming quality was the door man, we was very nice and helpful."

0,I enjoyed reading this book.  This is the second book I have read from Ms. Belle Calhoune.  And I totally enjoyed it.  It's a story about forgiveness.  What kind of forgiveness? Forgiveness of oneself  Sometimes things happen in life that causes us to feel guilty and life seems to stop.  But this story shares with us what to do when that happens. I recommend this book 100% and if you haven't read Reunited with the Sheriff I also  recommend it.  I can't wait for Ms. Belle Calhoune next book.
0,My yellow lab ate this in 3 days.  Every evening I would find the two pieces separated in different parts of the yard. The plastic was pretty soft and a larger dog could easily chew it to pieces.  It didn't serve its purpose. My dog thought of it as a toy not a waterer...

0,"I purchased the eight volume set but I am reviewing each volume separately.  Porter Rockwell was a real Mormon lawman and enforcer for the LDS.  A member of the famous or infamous Danite order founded to protect the LDS, Rockwell is a controversial figure in the History of the West.  Author Michael Newton delves into this and some Mormon history as the novel progresses.  How accurate that history is, I am not sure.  It fits generally with what I know but I don't know specifics of Mormon history and don't have enough interest in it to research all of the details in this novel.  Accurate or inaccurate history aside, the story is exciting, easy to read and a good western tale.  Although some of the writing is a little sloppy.  For instance:  ""Striped trousers below, with shoes on small feet polished to a gleaming shine."". Polished feet huh? In addition some of the geography and phytogeography seems a little off."

0,"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park."" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny ""insipid""! I love the other novels, even the underrated ""Lady Susan,"" but I could not finish this one.  Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park-1999/dp/6305907145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park (1999)</a>.

I have previously used Camelbak and Platypus bladders, but each lent a disgusting plastic taste to my water.  I had taken to mixing Powerade with the water to try and cover up the taste.  We recently went on a week-long hiking trip in Peru, and I knew I wouldn't want to mix a sugary drink in my bladder to sip on all day, even if it was available.  So I purchased this Source/Deuter bladder and was not disappointed.  My water tasted like water even at the end of the day.  It's also easy to fill and I have come to really appreciate the cover for the bite valve.  Highly recommend."

0,"I don't give out five stars often, but this movie merits 5 at least. My degree in history came in handy for this film.  With attention to detail, the film is not only breathtaking in scope, scenery, and impact, it is a living history wherein you can see a slice of 18th century life. The film is another rendition of James Fennimore Cooper's famous tome.  However, it's 100x better than the old Hollywood film of the same name.  This one is nuanced, showing the motivation of the French as well as the English, the nature of the Indians fighting for each side (i.e. the French-Indian War), as well as the colonists (i.e. us) who are cast adrift by an English parent country itself under siege by the powerful French regime opposing them in every (war) theatre.  The movie covers the daughters of the English commanding officer in the area and their struggle to survive in an incredibly hostile wilderness, beset by the French&their Indian allies, and the spectre of being alone.  Somehow, some of the heroes survive while others do not.  The cinemetography, musical score, and fine screenplay just seal the deal; a must-have film..."

The size of the adapter is nice and compact. The charger is also a bit smaller than I expected. I can use the mini with a USB charger in it for charging or charging with my iPad. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it's small enough to be easy to carry around, but I'm not sure that I would want to carry it around with me. Also, the cord is kind of stiff, but it's not bad. Overall, this is a great product for the money. I purchased this for my nephew's laptop and it works great."
0,"Great product, easy to apply. The nice thing about this design is that you can use it horizontal or vertical. We wanted to cover a window that was about 60 inches wide and 30 inches tall. Didn't think it would look good if we had to use more than one piece. Most privacy screens that were the right size had a design that could only be used vertically and were max of 36 inches wide, so wouldn't work for us. Finding a privacy screen (other than plain etched) that works horizontally was awesome."
0,"Motion sensors are great for different areas around the house.  Couple of places we use them for are in the garage/storage rooms.  Basically a place you're going to go into often that you don't want to have to flip a light.  Works great when carrying something.  The other place that works well is a pantry/bathroom.  There are a couple of modes here that are nice, including the ambient mode which basically will not trigger if the room is already light enough, this is pretty great.  You can also trigger it on manually which is great if you know you are going to be in a room for awhile and are worried about the sensor picking you up (although this sensor is quite sensitive -- and has different settings for the size of the room).  Good price and one of those things that will make you smile every time you walk into a room with one."

This is a very bad movie.  Unlike so many other reviewers on this page, I found it to be dull and mechanical, a by-the-numbers production with a clunky and unappealing robot at its center, filled with stock characters that do and say exactly what you think they will because you've seen it all a million times before.

It will be a perfect addition to my dogs house. If you have a large dog, it's a great addition to your home. If you have a small dog, it will be a perfect addition to your house. It's easy to clean and easy to put on. My dog loves the little plastic ball inside, which he uses to put treats in the refrigerator. I put it in his bathtub, and he loves it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will purchase again. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for him to stretch out and play. It's small enough to fit him well enough that he doesn't get too far out. My cats love this food. My dog is about 20 lbs. and he was very picky about his food so I would give this a 5 star rating. However, he was not crazy about this food either. He liked it because it was dry and was easy to digest. However, he did not like the taste. He is a picky eater so I gave him a free bag of this food. He didn't like it because it was too dry. However, he will eat it if he gets a little bit of it. I will definitely buy this food again."

This is still a good investment.  I'm not sure how I could get better than this!  I think the quality of this is just great.  I highly recommend it!I am returning this product. I have been using it for a month now and the only difference is that the handle is now a bit harder to use and the handle is a little more flexible.  I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it for a month and it still works well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now more likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it for a month and it still works well.  I had to return it because of that.  It's still a nice liner and a good value.Very nice."

0,"Even though I gave this 5 stars, I am not able to fully review how good the product is for helping dogs with joint problems.  My little dog is 16 years old and is very suspicious of anything different.  He did not like the smell of it, but that's nothing against the taste or quality of the product; he is a very picker eater.  The only way I could get him to eat is was to reduce it to powder and sprinkle it on moist foods that he really likes.  Amazon only gives you a certain amount of time to review the product on Vine, so I had to give up and review it.  The pills are big and a small dog only eats half, but they are scored and easy to break in half.  I really do think that they helped a little, the few times I could get him to eat them, but I think a liquid version of this would work better for him.  If your dog isn't picky, he'll probably like them, though."

0,"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!  Oh well, that's modern film-making for you -- where directors and writers confuse their own aspirations for social change and ""influencing the masses"" with authentic telling of history.  Advice: stick to authentic documentaries, and keep fresh batteries in your BS detector."

0,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil. Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together. I think this could be a really great book I just think it needs a little polishing"

So it would be nice if Amazon included an image showing these in an earlobe to give a better indication of their size. They are quite a bit smaller than I expected. As someone else mentioned, they would work perfectly in a second piercing, as they are about the size of a stud. That said, they are cute, but I probably would not have gotten them if I knew how small they were. Also, they look a bit crude to me. I got a fleur de lis necklace when I was in New Orleans and it is so beautifully made, with a lot of attention to detail. I did not think these had nearly that same level of detail or refinement."

0,"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.  I must disclose that I received this product at a discount for thorough testing and evaluation and an honest and unbiased review. I am aware some people disregard reviews from reviewers that received a discount because they think that the review is not genuine. I assure you this is not the case. I myself depend on reviews for most all of my purchases and attempt to provide  information that I would also look for in the products I test and I only test products I myself  would purchase.

0,"McIntyre sets out from California to see if he can get all the way across the country without touching money, relying only on average Americans for shelter and food. It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.  If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.  Funny at times and heartbreaking at others, this was a well written and fascinating story."

The comedians that starred in this film have so much talent that seemed a bit wasted because this movie was about 15-20 mins longer than it should have been. This would have been terrific as a 1 hour Key & Peele comedy special, but it doesn't quite work as a feature film.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the kitten that played Keanu was absolutely adorable!! That cat was the true star of this movie. And it's precious that Keanu Reeves was the voice of the cat in one scene of the movie.  If you can see Keanu for $3.99 or less, then watch it. If it costs more than that, I would pass."

0,"I've always been a sucker for a bad boy who comes back to a town from his youth and tries to makes up for past mistakes! This is such a book. But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him.

0,"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.  There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.  It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).  I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund."
1,"My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable. My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me 'in the system'. We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. The room that I had originally reserved (King) was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room. I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service. It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. When finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it. So now I am cranky, tired and starving! I ate what I could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms. The woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago. I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again."
0,"UPDATE May 20th ... Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today was the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof.  I finagled the strap to attach on both sides via the metal attachments holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stays out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good.  The bag is much larger than I figured it was going to be.  It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'.  The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually works and when you unfasten it it makes that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it.  Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick.  Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartments and the main compartment.  In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff has it's setbacks too though.  For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Ordered for Mom and she loves it! She says there is plenty of room, it's a great color, she loves the decorative 'bow' on the front ... all of it! Just a complete success!  Arrived Saturday before Mother's Day, gift wrapped as requested ... thanks so much!  If this was a {Shoulder Bag}, I'd order one for myself (hint-hint!!)"

0,"As a new parent I was completely at a loss as to what to get my son when we went to the beach and pool. I thought back to the water wings we used as kids and they just didn't make me feel safe enough, especially as we were also going out on a boat. After lots of research, I took a chance and bought this and it was great. It worked for everything, boating was safe, in the pool he was able to float face up comfortably, but we didn't use it in the beach not for any reason, just we were holding him and it seemed excessive. But as floats go, this is the real deal, it is proper sturdy and reliable."
1,"This is a wonderfully insightful and thought provoking movie about a man who becomes obsessed with the idea of being a superhero. The movie is both entertaining and heart-warming. I highly recommend it. It is a good film, and one I would watch again. The series was great and a must see for any fan of the series. I highly recommend this series. I love this movie. I have watched it many times. I like that the actors are better than the director. I hope the series continues. I love this series."

0,"I want all of the guinea pig world to know these EZ whelp pads are awesome. This is so much better than fleece and totally cost effective. I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell. I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage. I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box. Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing. Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars."

The only thing I don't like is that Dani is only 14 and way too young to have the smoldering sexual tension that Mac and Barrons had. I hope the next book in the series fast forwards a few years! I don't think I can wait for her to turn a respectable age before she finally loses her V-card to...who will it be? Dancer, Christian or Ryodan? Hmmmm the possibilities!

0,"I have really enjoyed all these books, now on #4. They are different as they go into great detail about everyday things which is enjoyable sometimes, especially with the pets. I do see some discrepancies that I believe another reader pointed out. The one I find the most disappointing is the age of the main character and that of her mother. I do wish authors cared enough about their readers to keep the facts more accurate. Other then that I cant find too much to pick at. I liked the characters and all the people involved and the stories but one other thing I do have to take issue with is her job. I lived in a large city before I retired and I cannot remember ever going to an open house that was ""staged"" the way she talks about in these books. It is so over the top and how anyone could find themselves wanted to live in one she has staged is beyond me. They are good mysteries though, only figured out 1 so far."

0,"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...]. One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it! When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally. Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched. A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way. I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year. I'd encourage anyone to try this out,it's a good one.  JUST DON'T PINCH OR PULL ON THE WIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,I absolutely loved this book. Lucky might of needed a dose of reality a little bit.

It will work again the next day.  I have tried everything.  Once, on a longer run, it did restart towards the end of the run.  This was my first, and now last, Philips purchase.  I just don't understand how the quality control could be so poor.  Original Review Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.  I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice. The cord gets in the way a bit if you wear your phone/mp3 on your arm but there is clip that helps keeps it out of the way.

0,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.   At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."

They are clip on earrings, so even if you don't have your ears pierced you can join in the fun! These earrings glow for hours! The only issue I found with them was getting them to stay together at first. It took a bit for them to stay in the connectors to be able to wear them. These are tons of fun!! My daughter even ended up using them as a bracelet at one point! So much fun! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."

The  MOA return to zero isn't bunk, I've generally seen either spot on or at most a  MOA difference after dismounting for cleaning.  I originally decided to try one for just that reason, the ability to clean, but when I look at the precision rings, 20 MOA rails etc. these are very hard too beat and real value for their cost.  When you regularly shoot 300-600 yards with an AR this is the mount to have."

I love the style of these slip on shoes. I bought the brown/ bronze color. The shoe was slightly short. Not uncomfortably so, but I like room for a sock liner. Not with this shoe. The worst thing about the shoe is that dip in the heel. Somehow that dip makes the sides of the shoe gape open. Noticeably too. I don't know how the shoe would do with a wide foot. My feet are medium width. There was no side support with these shoes.  They looked like I was wearing a shapeless bedroom slipper. I'm returning them. Three stars because they're lightweight, great material, beautiful color and I like the slip on style."

I then tried another test of 24 hours with the same result on one of the sections that was untouched.  Also there is a strong smell from this product, not too noxious but there is absolutely an odor.  I think if I just used this on latex it would work but for me to prepare for tile this product has been nothing short of a disaster.

1,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel, located on North Rush Street. As part of the Hilton hotel chain, I was confident that I would have a positive experience. Unfortunately, from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out, I was plagued with nothing but problems. When I walked into the hotel, I was not greeted by the concierge, which is usually a bad sign. (He was reading a newspaper.) Then, when I announced that I was holding a reservation, they desk clerk was unable to find it. I had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system, but they could not find the room I had reserved. Finally, they assigned me a room, but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor. I was very disappointed with the room and its decor. The room smelled of stale smoke, even though it was on a non-smoking floor. The bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom. I had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago. Surely, this was not the way the Hilton chain operates! There continued to be problem throughout my stay. I asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late, which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting. I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room, and it never showed up -- at all! And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm, so my shower was short and unsatisfying. I decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. Upon my return home, I wrote a letter to the hotel manager, but never received a reply. Because they refused to acknowledge that I had problems, I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again, and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future."

I was so excited to see this novella that I immediately purchased it and read it.  I definitely think this novella adds to the Quarter Mile Hearts series. It begins before Quarter Mile Hearts and catches up with the story told within Quarter Mile Hearts. I totally loved that. I would recommend reading Supercharged before Quarter Mile Hearts.  Supercharged made me love Max even more and it even made me want to reread Quarter Mile Hearts because I missed this world so much. There were times I was extremely frustrated with Max because he kept trying to fit in instead of just marching to the beat of his own drum.  Overall, I really loved this novella and I cannot wait tor Reckless Hearts."

Hotel easy to find. Never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood/area. Saw very few homeless or panhandlers. Walked all over the place. Great location and hotel is about a $5-$6 cab ride from most major attractions/shopping/restaurants. Hotel is almost gawdy with colors/decor, but it's not that different from a cruise ship decor. It was not annoying decor by any means. Check in was painless and the service was great! Heard NO noise whatsoever...the reports of 'thin walls' are greatly exaggerated. The walls are all concrete and thick...we heard NOTHING both nights we were there! Highly recommend this hotel!

Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No assembly required.  VERY sturdy.  My husband who is 6' 4"" and 215 pounds had no problem walking across it.  The beam did not bend.  Obviously, my husband won't be using it daily.  But I wanted to see if it could really support 200+ pounds like claimed.  ( I believe I read 250 lb)  But my 50lb daughter is the primary user.  But like said, no problem supporting him.  So I am pleased that my daughter will be able to use it for a long time.  I love the height of this beam.  Tall enough so you don't feel like it's on the floor and you can practice scoops.  But low enough that you don't get scared to practice new skills.  I also like the option to purchase leg in the future to increase the height.  Very pleased with the quality."

The location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better (Peninsula, Park Hyatt, shoot the Omni was 10x better). We ordered a deluxe executive suite, and it was so below sub par. The room was very small (so small the ice bucket was in the closet), the bathroom was just as small, just well lit (a plus). Wallpaper was peeling, outlets barely covered, no view. The only thing appealing was the bed, and that may have been because I was so tired. And we were really excited because this is the Palmer House. The Palmer House does have nice restaurants: the Lockwood (quiet, distinguished) and the Potter's Lounge (grown/sexy)"

0,"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.  I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking."
0,"If you're a fan of the angelically irreverent Mark Twain, there's a *very* high probability you will enjoy this. It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.  Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughing-It/dp/1626360634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughing It</a>.

0,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.  This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.  After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.  This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"

0,"My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."

It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.  Now the bad...  -Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet. - The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.  Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.  Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad."

I will definately purchase more of these, and will feel comfortable wearing them for tanning, at the beach or at the waterpark, they will look good anywhere. I just purchased two more of these the red and black.  I thought the blue ones being so good might have been a accident but I got to admit the red and black are just as great.  I don't know what they have done to the fabric but I have never felt speedos feel so good next to my body.  There are so many color options they could add in this style I hope they do.  You can not go wrong with these, I usually purchase aussiebum swimwear but these feel better and with less cost.  Keep up the good work speedo and thanks for a GREAT product."

0,"A good novel of WW2, focusing more on the countryside -- small villages and farms -- and the views of their inhabitants and the unknown brainwashing they encountered. Also gave insight into the resistance vs. the Nazi followers, the nobility vs. the commonfolk, as three women's stories unfold. Not the caliber of The Nightengale or Beneath a Scarlet Sky, but an engaging novel from a somewhat different perspective. Wished there had been more ""action"" or ""suspense."
0,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man... Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey. While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books. By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."

I have bamboo cutting boards and since I know bamboo stands up well to water, this was an easy purchase for me.

It can be used on a dresser or counter top in addition to the tub. It's spacious and securely holds wine glasses. If this had rubber grips for on the edge of the tub, I'd rate it 5 stars, but overall I really like it."
0,"New Beginnings Phyllis is second novella in the Zimmerman Academy Shorts series by Kathi Daley. This is a spinoff of the Zoe Donovan series. This short story is told from Phyllis Kings perspective. The early chapters were originally included in several of the recent Zoe Donovan series books. Im looking forward the growth and changes in Phyllis life since joining the faculty at Zimmerman Academy and opening her home to Brooklyn Banks, Pepper Pepperton, and Eve Lambert. The novella ends with a mystery surrounding an unpublished manuscript. Phyllis friends, Hazel, Luke and Ethan explore a donated book written in 1956 and recognize women today experience many situations, frustrations and emotions as women did long ago. They, also, delve into the history of Ashton Falls formerly known as Devils Den. The day ends with an amazing birthday party for Phyllis surrounded by her friends.  Kathi Daleys novella is a quick, enjoyable read which flows smoothly. Even in the novellas, the characters are well developed and the setting readily transports the reader into the world that she has created; one in which the reader feels as if they are visiting with friends. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted cozy mystery with lovable characters. I am looking forward to reading more books written by this author. If you have not had the opportunity to read Ms. Daleys books, be sure to become acquainted with each of her series (each uniquely themed and superbly written). In the interim, sit back and enjoy this is cozy mystery, perfect for those who appreciate a quick, well written novella."

Apparently this rack is only made for Toyota's, with their track being set close to the top of the bedrail. So if you are considering this rack and own a Nissan, first decide if drilling two holes in your bed is acceptable.  I'm not sure I want two permanent holes in my truck to worry about rusting.

This is 100% organic cotton, which means it is very gently on baby, and gentle on the environment as well.  The dyes are even natural! The snaps are secure, but easy to close, and the legs snap all the way down to the foot, so it's a lot easier to put on and take off of little squirmy ones.  There are little foldover fabric covers for baby's hands to keep him/her from scratching, so you can eliminate the little mittens that don't seem to stay on.  The company guarantees satisfaction with their product, and this comes in numerous colors and several different sizes.  Since this is all cotton, there may be a bit of shrinkage, I didn't really see any, but I only washed and dried once in order to use the first time.  Since it's cotton, you can wash at high temps to completely sanitize though!!

Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge, which has nothing but fattening pastries, bagels and cereal. Low-level Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame. And what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 6:30, not sitting down to their meager breakfast. The in-room wifi is a pain to access, and I somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though I selected the basic plan. (Don't get me started on how a $89/night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a full-service Hilton & Towers seemingly can't...). Finally, what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? It's an unseemly waste of space, especially when the rooms are so meager. And the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992, not 2009, as does the picture-tube TV (vs. flat panel). Overall, this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed."

1,"Lee Child's Reacher books are a real pleasure to read. I will admit that I have been a little apprehensive about the book. The characters and plot seemed a bit predictable, and it was difficult to follow the plot in the first book. There are some very interesting characters and events that seemed to take place in a real time world, but the overall story was rather predictable. I also felt like I was getting to know some of the characters. However, I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the history of the American Revolution."

Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied. This carrier comes with a zipper on the side that can't really be secured because it's not a double zipper. I had to zip tie it to the handle and my cat was still giving me a run for my money trying to squeeze out. Too late to return it since it's used, but I wouldn't recommend it for cats, especially sneaky ones."

1,"This will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life. Hotel Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice. Whether if it's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite, all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based, so it suits ones personality. Even if you are a super sized person, like me with a height of 6'4', there are special 'Tall Rooms' just for you. My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. Before I go to a meeting, I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. After I come back from the meeting, I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. I just didn't want to leave that hotel; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago, I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago."

0,"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.  The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.  This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II""."

0,"We had this gun for more than a month now. We purchased NERF guns in the past and the automatic feature sounds very appealing and fun. Right out of the box (after inserting new C-batteries which were purchased separately), the first time the new darts were placed in the transparent clip, one of the darts clogged the gun. There are times when my son can shoot the entire contents of the clip (18 elite darts - we ended up buying additional elite darts from Amazon - I believe this is a good deal:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Dart-Refill-Pack-30-Darts/dp/B0083TXZVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nerf N-Strike Elite Dart Refill Pack (30 Darts)</a>), and other times when the gun gets clogged. It became a habit to watch my son excited to use this gun, only to have it get clogged, and get him upset. I would say the major fault with this gun is clogging: about 30-40% of the time. That's way too much, and I believe the reason for it is the design of the flexible darts. In addition, I would say the use of C batteries may not be the most inspired option. You have to unscrew the battery holder, and I believe that the batteries can drain unnecessary fast, since there is no shut-off button. Otherwise I do not know how to explain why we had to replace batteries 2 weeks after relatively limited playtime.  I was undecided to give this product 3 or 4 stars. I settled on 4 since the gun itself is great fun when it works. I find the issue to be with the flexibility of the darts. Once they get bent, the chances for clogging increases, and even new darts can get stuck and stop the fun."

0,"I've been here for 4 days. Great location right off of miracle mile, near all major hotels, best shopping and theatres. Rooms very large. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful, and respond immediately. Problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on Superior between St. Clair and Michigan Avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities, and just about everything is in walking distance from here). At night, the street on the north side of Superior is dark, and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. The street people do not approach you, although they may stare as you go by. Usually 2 or more along the way, where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus. I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) There are homeless up and down Michigan Street, but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work, and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. For now, expect two extremely small, warm, slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm, cramped hallways! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting, and the wallpaper is peeling in places. In the room, several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection, the carpets were stained, the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible), the TV is very small (16 Inch?) and the windows very, very dirty. You won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it, sometimes more than once. The 'pub ' downstairs is run down, dark and kind of creepy. Food and room service are very expensive, as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable, there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area, plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St. Clair street toward the north and south. You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan. Pool small, but clean. All in all, it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room, but I think it is overpriced, and I would not stay here again."

Within the River north shopping district.I love to shop so that was what i needed. Magnificent 2 room layouts with kitchen.

After dinner and wine I enjoyed the comfort of the heated indoor pool so relaxing. I would recommend these suites to everyone I know."

I am using it in the kitchen, in a shed, in a closet, in the hallway, in a bedside table, and in my back yard.  It is a great light, and it has a very low profile.  I've had it for about a year now and I am very happy with it.

She has a very narrow fit and this specific style allows for great adjustment for her feet. We will stick with this style, just buying a new pair/size each summer! They also hold up great! I'm hoping her younger sister will be able to use the smaller pairs (depending on her size/season), as they are all still in great condition despite wearing and washing them all one summer each (growth is our only reason to replace, as she hasn't worn out a pair yet). They also work great with short socks for extended wear and comfort."

0,"My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a blowout 'American Girl' Weekend and chose the Monaco because of it's glowing reviews. We arrived late and maybe that's when they put out their second-stringers, but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff--like we were an intrusion. I'll never understand this--they're in the hospitality business and they're inhospitable! (This is getting picky, but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. The repeated 'HM' initials are peeling off--looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability). When we got to our room we found the maid's ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed (yuck!). I'm still trying to figure out that scenario. There were no ashes--so I've ruled out spontaneous combustion. Also, to the disappointment of my daughter, the much-advertised goldfish was MIA. The bellhop (who apologized for the shoes) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed '...is that OK?' he said. I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C/ fish to make a tired 5-year-old happy. On the up side, the rooms are nice and have an over-the-top decoration that my daughter loved ('I'd like to live here!' she said). The bed is VERY comfortable--my wife wants the same brand now. The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower--except for the cheap fall-apart-while-you're-using-it toilet paper. Come on Kimpton! How much can a decent roll cost? The view towards the river is great (try to get one) and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window--she closed the curtains and was in her own 'club house' watching the world go by from from high above the city. In short: very nice hotel--desk staff at night could be nicer (wouldn't cost anything and would have made up for the maid's shoes!)"
0,"This hotel was not worth it. From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out, the staff were rude and contemptuous. Rooms were only serviceable, and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website. The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient. The 'fitness centre' was tiny and poor. We would not come here again."

0,"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.  That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.  Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.  I've brought it in the shower and into a swimming pool with me and had no problems, so it seems great for water sports and activities."

0,"Dan Edwardes' introduction to parkour is a well-written and well-organized introduction to parkour, but unfortunately it's too basic and shallow an introduction.  I do not think the first instinct of people who are interested in learning about parkour will be to buy a book -- there are too many entertaining youtube videos that offer a sexy taste of what parkour is like.  And serious readers won't read this book about parkour -- there isn't any intellectual weight to the book, not enough about parkour's history and the psychology of its adherents.  I think the vast majority of people who buy this book (including myself) are novice practitioners looking for a reference book, especially on more complicated movements and proper technique -- and on this front this book sorely disappoints."

0,"We bought this steam vac for my mother-in-law since my husband broke her other hoover steam vac. We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).  The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.  It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.  So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use."

0,"Hey! you know that Chance scouted out the location of the canyon when he was haveing her plane connections delayed and rerouted. I loved the way L. Howard kept the character of Chance true to form from one story to the next. Also if John is old enough to have a girlfriend he is old enough to get caught up in some machinations that needs Zane and Chance to rescue him and set him on the path of his two uncles'- besides Zane needs to produce another daughter and Chance one to put them into a hilarious competition [aided and abetted by their wives] there are still enough up close stories to be told with Mary and Wolf still in the background -- and lets go back in time to Michael's and Josh's stories. I, along with so many others, agree that this has been the best family series ever written - with all of the ladies well matched with the Mackenzie men - this is a family that can't stand still - these are classics - With Sunny willing to put her life on the line for Chance, she does a great job of breaking down his reserve and teaching him to love.  Love only comes from giving. I do love a woman who is willing to take care of her own self-preservation [grin] and dragging a man into realizing her worth. L. Howard has spoiled us with her Mackenzie Men -- Don't stop now! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- DEFINITELY A KEEPER FOR ANY LIBRARY!"

No realistic woman would act so foolish.  Therefore, the author kept inventing unreal problems and solutions.

0,"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.  When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.  I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....  Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.  Highly recommend!!  Great experience overall."

I like that it has a remote control for voice commands. It's not bulky but I really like that it has a built-in camera. I've found that it is really easy to operate it and not have to worry about it falling off the dashboard. I love that it has a USB charging port for my phone and tablet.

It's great that he can play with it and enjoy it and to learn from it. This is a cute little plush. It is a good size and the little pieces fit together really well."

1,"I think it is a good size and the materials are good. My only complaint is the extra large clumps. I am not sure how the plastic part would hold up to the regular clumping. I would like to keep it for my cats to eat. I received this item as a gift to my wife. She is a very happy cat and enjoys being home when she is with me. I am very pleased with this purchase. I will be ordering another one of these for the future. I will update this review as I receive them. Pros: -Easy to use -Cons: -Not as heavy as I had hoped for -Very poor quality materials -Very thin plastic  -Sturdy and sturdy, but my cats would not touch it  -The clasp is a little too small -My cat is a big chewer and I thought this was a cute toy to hold in her mouth. She just pulls it out of her mouth and then shakes it around so the clasp slides down into her mouth. I feel like the clasp is too tight because she is very far away from it. I wish they had made this one a little bigger. I would have given it a 5. The clasp is very sturdy. The clasp is very comfortable. The clasp does not slip out of the clasp, so it is secure and secure. The clasp is very easy to put on and remove. I put a couple of extra screws in the clasp to tighten it up."
1,"Exactly what I was looking for. The quality is good and it fits my AR well. If you have an AR-15 you will want to get the Taurus version. I would definitely recommend this product. It will be a great addition to your collection.I like the shape of the rubber band. I have a large chest and I can wear it on my chest. I also like the shape of the rubber band. I am not sure if it will fit well in a woman's chest or in a man's chest. I will probably order a medium. I think it fits a little snug, but it is definitely a good size for me.I have a Nikon D810,"

0,This book is great. And even though it takes place in 1938 some things never change like the jealousy she feels towards Eve even though they're bffs. I didn't pick up on whom she married and had to go back and read that part and there really was no clue aside from the name. I really didn't understand why Tinker just left and felt that could've been explained better. But I really liked the descriptions of New York and all the places that aren't there anymore. I had no idea the subway pictures were real or would've paid more attention to them.
0,This is a very good Set of resistance band for home workout or to add intensity on your gym workout by using the bands as variable weight and tension for your exercise. Quality is good and it comes with nice attachments if you want to use it at home. Overall for the price it is a good bargain and a must to have for home fitness.
0,Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was forming on the glass. I had them for quite a while so I didn't return them. Purchased the second set and they did the same thing. I have this pattern in the dishes and wanted plastic glasses because of them being in a motorhome.
1,I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago. I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again.
0,"Bought these for my 4 yr old son for jet skiing. I expected them to be too big because nobody seems to be able to make gloves for a little kid, but they are perfect! he loves them and they fit well. He has somewhat of a challenge getting them off and if you don't take them off right you will have to turn each finger right side out before wearing again, but its not that big of a deal!"

If this wasn't a gift, I'd return it for my very frustrated four year old. The box is supposed to serve as a little suitcase, but even that part is poorly designed.

0,"Complete disappointment. Problems: 1. The alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. It was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. Sooo annoying. And there was no off switch on the damn thing. I had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). I kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. The shower was ONLY incredibly hot. Turn it all the way cold...very hot. Turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. Grrrrreat. So how do I get water that won't scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. Good job Omni! 3. Hallway carpets are disgusting and old. Walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. And my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. Talk about an overpriced dump."
0,"These are no longer made in the USA.  My most recent purchase - the bag looks different, and they have a very strong odor, which they didn't before.  The bag now clearly states they're made in China.  I decided to let my dog eat these but not to reorder since I only want products exclusively made in the USA, and my dog doesn't even really like them as much, so I'm going to end up throwing away more than half of the bag.  I won't be ordering these again"
0,"I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.  The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.  I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/"

He is able to comfortably sleep on this window bed and it has stayed in place without fail. I was hesitant, but the suction cups work very well so there is no fear of it falling. However, our cat tends to get hyper and loves to run and jump. Upon jumping on this bed from about a foot above, the suction cups gave way and scared our cat enough to keep him away from it for a few days. He has since recovered and now sleeps on his window bed most mornings to warm himself in the sun. He didn't care for the texture of the actual bed so I threw a blanket over it and that did the trick."

0,"My 12 year old sheltie has bad hips, which I guess is common for his age and breed.  Before a vet recommended this product, we were helping our dog stand up after laying down for too long, and my husband had to carry him up and down stairs in order to go outside.  This was three years ago, and I was sure it was about time to put him down.  He's a little slow going up and down stairs, but he does it on his own now.  He gets up and down on his own and follows me around just like he did when he was a puppy.  He's a happy dog and still as loveable as always.  If we accidentally run out of Nutramax Cosequin DS, he starts to limp and slow down within a week.  This has truly been amazing .. I wish they made something that worked this well for humans."

It was easy to wash and pretty dang cute, too.  That is, until our pup hit puberty and learned that he could destroy things.  Mr, Mallard here lasted longer that I expected he would.  He put up a pretty good fight against the shark-tooth puppy.  But it was only a matter of time...  If your dog isn't a toy destroyer, this is a GREAT deal.  Otherwise, prepare for a duck funeral or go with a Kong heavy-duty toy."

The length was perfect as I'm not short nor too tall, but sometimes have an issue with the length being too short for regular.  It held up very well to washing and was a bit tight on the first wear, but loosened up very quick.  The are flattering and very easy to move in."

0,Idea of having a collapsible rack wasn't why I purchased it but I have found this useful.  Nice and deep and can store plenty on it so really because it is deep it takes up less space than other racks.  Very sturdy and even with a lot of heavy items on it it was very easy to move.

0,"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""  The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.  However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."

I opted for the Business Plan, although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from, such as the Allergy Friendly, Monarch Suite, State Suite, all the way up to the Presidential Suite. My suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort, equipped with Wi-Fi, a generous 37 inch television, spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. I dined at the Stetson's Chop Shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared. The staff was curtious and accommodating. For breakfast, I opted to have my meal brought to my room where I started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong, gourmet coffee.

Because I didn't follow the Bee Gees as closely as I did the Beatles, I didn't really know that much about their history or much of their music. One thing I like about all of James' books, including this one, is the interesting tidbits of history that he includes - not only about the music and the bands, but about the time period in which they became popular."

0,"This is the dictionary of bellydance- 2 discs- she goes through standing moves, traveling moves, veil and zill introductions, and some combinations.  Very useful and it is voiced over- she doesn't stop moving, the narration explains what she is doing.  I like how she doesn't dissect things to the point where you can't foresee what you trying to do.  She does the movements up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns.  Beautiful variety of costumes, Jehan illustrates that you don't have to have a model's figure to be a gorgeous sexy dancer- she is so beautiful!  I recomend that you also get 'the ultimate bellydance workout' with this dvd set because that dvd is fantastic and this set explains what the dancers in the other dvd are doing.

Only 3 minor points: downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast (coffee & pastries), but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this; the cost of internet - $9.99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free; there was only powered milk in the rooms, which wasn't that nice.

0,"This unicycle works great.  I got one for my 9 year old daughter, who has a 25"" inseam/instep whatever it is called (measurement from the floor to crotch, using regular sneakers.  As other posts say, this could be used down to 24"" inseam.  I just had to hacksaw off a few inches of the bottom of the seat post, so that it would go down far enough and not hit the tire.  This takes 20 seconds.  This cycle is good quality, far better than she was using at school.  It has a really nice hand hold on the front of the seat.  She is very happy with it."

This book was very informative. I am now reading the next book in the series. I read this book years ago and I thought it would be a great read. I just read it and loved it. I have read many of the books in the series and it is a wonderful story. The story was interesting and I enjoyed the twists and turns. I would recommend it. I loved this book. It was very informative and detailed. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a history lesson. I really enjoyed this book and it was good, but I really didn't like the whole of the characters.

The extra weight is in the way of the legs. This is why I ordered the full size instead of the 8"" version. I had to order a second size so I could use it when I run with the legs bent over and on. I like that the legs are longer than the 8"" version. I have a small belly and I feel that the extra weight makes it a bit heavier. I would have liked to have been able to do that. I had some other reviews and they said the extra weight made it easier to hold my arms in the arm position. I have to say the extra weight is nice. I haven't had any problems with this on my bench."

0,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.  In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.  It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.  For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."

0,"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today."
1,"I have tried the OXO (Cordless) and I have not found a difference. The cordless OXO is much better and is cheaper than the Cordless OXO. I have been using this OXO for about a year now and it has not moved. It is very easy to use and I can use it on my OXO. I just put the OXO in my microwave. I have a hard time cleaning it because it is so dirty. I would recommend this OXO for anyone who needs to clean a microwave or microwave oven. I have used it on a couple of my other OXO's and I like it so much I bought another one for my family. It is also a good quality. I am very happy with this purchase. Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It was a little stiff but that's how it was intended to be. She loved it!  I'll definitely buy it again. Nice, thick, easy to clean, and I like that it holds a lot of items. I have a ton of items in this bag, and I have a lot of items in the freezer. These bags are very convenient and easy to clean.

Each role model plays a different, yet important role in their son's life and this book addresses that nicely."

I'm not a fan of the idea of the author being so powerful that she has to hide behind a cover.  I'm not a fan of the author getting away with it, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy it.

The hotel lounge was a 'room', it was really odd and very dark. The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking. Resembled something you'd find on a street. To top it all off we woke up after night #2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us. My husband and I were both bitten. I was bitten WAY more than my husband. My legs were covered with bites. I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week. I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes. There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it. The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub. The view in room #607 is of a roof. Not good. The stay was VERY disappointing. The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor."

0,"I saw The Suitor at the Sacramento French Film Festival this year, and bought the whole collection for the Sacramento Alliance Francaise.  Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.  The film becomes a talkie only when the action takes place after talkies were invented."

I ordered them for my daughter, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I have gotten quite excited and have already bought a fair amount of wardrobe items. I ordered these pearls thinking they would be excellent for the baby photos however, this set is more appropriate once she is a teenager. The size of the pearls is almost as large as my adult size necklaces and the length is only an inch smaller than my adult size necklaces!  This set is a fantastic value. I must admit, when I saw the High quality and great size of these pearls along with the excellent knotting between each individual pearl, I immediately put it around my own neck and looked in the mirror. I think these make excellent casual pearls for a small framed woman!  These are a fantastic value. In my photos I have this necklace along with my own pearl necklace which was around 1k I believe but that was so many years ago, I don't remember. I think the size of these pearls is FANTASTIC, the shapes of the individuals don't have the consistency and perfect shape as my older pearls have but this is because these are cultured pearls. I think the cultured look adds to the intrigue of this piece. I got the ribbon that is baby blue and I think it's the perfect shade and complements the necklace well. Pink may be too feminine in my opinion for these pearls. I love the blue. Once my daughter is a teenager, I think I will replace the ribbon with a clasp.

In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy)."

0,"Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.  My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.  Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances."

0,This harness was recommended to me by a dog trainer. It is a bit tricky to learn how to get it on your dog at first but once you get that down it's works really nicely. I appreciate it's  gentle approach to leash training a dog  and my 7 month old labrador is very responsive to a change in pressure in the harness and she promptly adjusts her walking speed. Even my 8 yr old lab who tends to pull a lot is responsive to the change in pressure in this harness. Other harnesses don't stop him from pulling.

0,"WOW!! Where do I start? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown. Check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge. The king bed was very comfortable. Our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. Even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. The room did show some signs of wear, but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. The hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. There is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets, with all the nightlife, and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the Hancock building. By staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. Had breakfast at the Pump Room, which is a story in itself. We had our photo taken in booth 1. Take some time and research who has sat in this booth. It is impressive. Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room. Didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but I will return for dinner someday. Breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. I can't wait to return here!"

0,"""Old Joy"" is a movie about a dog named Lucy. Lucy has an owner named Mark who is about to become a father. With his wife about to give birth, Mark takes off for an overnight road trip. Lucy likes this because she gets to ride along. Mark goes and gets his old friend Kurt. Kurt likes to smoke hoochie-choochie weed, but this is okay with Lucy because Kurt will pet her head enthusiastically and throw a stick for her. Lucy runs in the forest and finds a nice big stick. Kurt is taking Mark to a natural spring. Kurt gets lost. The men sit on an abandoned sofa next to a fire and play with an air gun while Lucy looks over at them. Lucy is played by Lucy the dog. She has wonderful dog expressions and a very perky tail that wags wildly with enthusiasm. Her owner Mark is played by Daniel London who was in ""Rent,"" ""The Minority Report"" & ""Patch Adams. ""  London turns in a good subtle performance as he says the right things to his friend, while constantly talking with his wife on the phone and being critical of Kurt. It's obvious that Mark has moved beyond this old buddy relationship. Kurt the buddy is played by Will Oldham who was in ""Junebug. ""  When they get to the sauna, the guys take off their clothes and Kurt tries to give Mark a massage. Mark is not comfortable with this. There are a lot of trees in the film. Kino International transferred it from 16 mm to 35 mm. It's being called artistic because it takes a long time to do very little. We get to watch sky and trees flicker by on the windshield for about four minutes. Actually, this is neither profound nor entertaining. It's a pretentious bit of cinema. That said, Lucy should have received a nomination as best animal in a movie."

It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.  I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P  These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.  ** FYI: I'm 5'11"" and 215 lbs."

0,"I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.  Oh, and the magnets on the earbuds are a nice bonus."

I contacted the company and they told me I can buy a replacement but there is only a 90 day warranty.  We payed close to $200 for this little trampoline and feel like it should last longer than a year.  I personally can't recommend it."

0,"Being the second part to this duet I can't go into to much detail because it would ruin book one but I will tell you how this book made me feel...... it made me feel everything!  We meet a few new characters and I loved them all! Some we see more then others but the way they are in this book, they play a big role. We get to see a few from the old book that make you angry and some make you some.  This one picked up where the last book left off and omg it was such a wild ride. Finishing it at 1am my time, it was one of those books I couldn't put off reading because I had to know how they ended. Did they get their happy ending? That was my main question and I got my answer. While how it ended threw me for a loop, I was ok that that ending.  Overall, the author did an amazing job at keeping me invested in these characters lives. That's a huge plus in the writing world where there are so many books being released. I would like to see full books of atleast one of the secondary characters but I don't think that's going to happen. But a girl can dream. So if you want something dark ambit totally swoonworthy then meet Madden Decker! He is up high on my list of book boyfriends. This book does have a lot of fought subjects, just like the first, but I promise the ride is worth it! 5 stars #2OCCJD"

I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it!

0,"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.  I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.  Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens."

0,"The Princess guitar is a pretty in pink starter guitar for small hands and short arms; however, there are some reservations that other reviewers also mentioned.  My 7 and 9 year old girls want to learn guitar.  A full sized guitar is hard for them to manage.  This is more their size.  It does need constant tuning- probably the biggest drawback.  My girls are learning off ""Alfred's Complete Kids' Guitar Course"".  It starts with single finger chords: C-G7-G then a 3 finger chord D7, which are fine on this guitar since it only involves the high 3-4 stings(mostly G-B-E).  For full 6 string strumming, there's usually a string that needs to be tuned or one can just ignore it, and let them strum and play to their imagination.  Our strings have not broken yet.  They have covers for the nuts and stickers to id the open string(which eventually fall off- not a biggie).  It's opening is small and the resonance very limited.  I find our girls use this for play, pretend and simple practice.  For better sound, they mess around with our electric quitar on a mini-amp.  For their age group, it takes time to get use to pressing the strings down and toughen and strenthen their little fingers up.  It's all for fun and they're advancing quite well at their own pace.  Overall, consider the cost and what you want out of a guitar- if it is just fun and goofing around with a little intro to the instrument- this one might suit you; otherwise, buy a better one."

0,"I like friends to lovers stories but this one was just OK.  I think for me the two had been out of contact for too long so the idea that either was harboring interest was a little far fetched.  Having said that, the characters had good chemistry and even though there was the usual angsty reason why one of them pulled away, at least the author didn't let that drag on for too long.  Not a  bad read."
0,"Stayed in old tower. Room was nice and room service was very good. Room Wi-Fi was expensive as was the bottled water. For the price of the room, at least there should at least have been water. I would rate the value as sub-par. The restaurant menu was not great, food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant.. In summary, I will go to the M... or H... next time. Some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of North Carolina and earlier this year in Northern California. P.S. If you are a fitness room user, the $16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel."

I hemmed it myself pretty easily by folding it inside out and sewing up the side seams enough to hold it in place.  He had no problems with it slipping and it looked professional. Usually I use Dritz stitch witchery iron on hem, which I love,  but I couldn't find it at the last minute."

I wasn't able to tighten the hole small enough so that my dog wouldn't fall out. I did not feel like my dog was safe in this carrier. Also, the first time I used it, I zipped it up once and when I unzipped it THE ZIPPER FELL OFF. I tried to get a refund through Amazon but I had to go through this third party seller. It was a huge hassle. I had to send them pictures of the broken zipper and they had issues opening the picture file even though it was a picture I took on my smart phone and sent it to them directly in an email. They would not take a return or give me a full refund. They offered to refund $5 to my credit card to make up for the broken zipper. I told them that was not acceptable and then they stopped responding. Beware of this seller. The company does not stand behind their products. If I NOT could raye them less tham 1 star, I would.

0,"Whatever there is to ""like"" about a radon mitigation fan, one ""needs"" it if the radon level is high.  I bought this unit to replace a competitor's unit that suffered a bearing failure after 2 weeks of service.  The original radon fan from this same competitor had been in service for 22 years.  Now, I don't think there is any real difference between this unit and the one that failed--they sure look similar--I think it was just bad luck with the first one.  But I wasn't prepared to  replace the failed unit with the same model so I ordered this one which has been working well so far.  I give it 4 stars because I think the price is higher than what it should be.  I paid the higher price because of my bad luck with the cheaper brand."

0,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).  Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.  The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book."

0,"The Atrocity Exhibition is a novel, or a series of short but connected stories, depending on how you decide to come at it.  Traven/Travis/Tallis/etc. appears as one man, moving through different evolutionary experiments, physical and psychological. He is experimenting with his psyche, as Ballard experiments with storytelling and writing. Chapter headings like ""The University of Death,"" ""Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown"" and ""You and Me and the Continuum"" give an idea towards the scope of the characters' inner and outer explorations.  The experimental sexual interactions, recurring alternate deaths and celebrity obsessions are from lists produced by Ballard using free assocation. Glimpses of themes of many of his later works can be found in this text. Special features of the Re/Search revised edition includes an introduction by William S. Burroughs, new notes and comments from Ballard, and four additional short stories. Notes and commentary from Ballard himself run in the margins alongside the text to which they are related.  The collection of medical illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner is impressive. Often overlooked are the excellent black and white urban images, photographed by Ana Barrado.  Her pictures are purposefully ""Ballardesque,"" showing abandoned parking lots, beaches and launch sites."

First, we arrive at 8 PM Sat. to check in. They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available, so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway (free of charge). However, the room was not ready yet. Finally at 10.30! (2.5 hrs later) we were able to get our room keys. But, there was no rollaway. Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later, we had a rollaway, but had to get the charge waived a second time. Now we go to check out on Mon. and they couldn't print us a bill or give us a total. We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $2,127.00! We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES, for $709 each, when our bill was supposed to be $450. After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1.5hrs, the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home.

0,"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.  At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.  If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.  If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo."

1,"I've been reading Sir Terry Pratchett's books for a long time, and I'm pretty sure that I have had a similar experience.  The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of young women who are going to kill him.  The young woman is a fourteen-year-old girl, and the group of women is so obsessed with killing her that they have to take her away from her.  They all have plans to kill her, and they all get together.  The story starts out fairly straightforward, with a young woman in a wheelchair being abducted and killed.  She doesn't have a lot of tools, but she is a fairly skilled fighter and she does a good job of keeping herself safe.  She's also a very clever, intelligent woman, and the group of women are quite good at making sure that the children are safe, too.  I really liked that the group of women were mostly young people, but they also had a lot of good qualities, such as being very intelligent and strong, so they would be very able to handle situations, and they were a bit stubborn about it.  I loved that the story was fairly straightforward, and I was quite impressed with how"

Those of us who are fans of the Cora's Bond and Cora's Choice series know the storyline from Cora's point of view.  Now we can follow what happened through Dorian's eyes.  Book 3 takes us up to the time Cora is introduced to the vampire community as Dorian's new cognate, chosen with the help of his new technology created to help cut the number of individuals who must die in the process of finding a mate.  An exciting race to save Cora from others who would do her harm starts the story.  It ends with a shell-shocked Cora who continues to learn more than she wants to know about the supernatural world she is now a part of.  Ms. Black did not leave us hanging in suspense, but left us wanting more of her wonderful words."
1,"It assembles and breaks down into a single unit, which is a handy feature for the person who needs a pair of sunglasses. The goggles are also designed to be worn in a closed position so that they can be easily moved around without damaging the lenses.  The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.  Overall, this product was very well received and was a great addition to my bike.My husband loves this shirt.

0,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.  The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.  Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!  Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review."

Works seamlessly when both sources are the same resolution (eg both 1080p, or both 1080i) but produces a glitchy output if the input resolutions differ (one 1080i and one 1080p).

0,"Clearly written for and marketed to the audience of the Hunger Games books, this series looks to be not nearly as involving as Collins'. (And could the cover be any more an almost rip-off of the Hunger Games covers?)  The problem with Divergent is that the main character isn't nearly as easy to relate to as Katniss Everdeen. In fact, she's downright unlikeable for much of the book. And the setting, with the rigidly divided society, just doesn't really make sense.  This isn't a bad book, and I'm sure a lot of readers will find it enjoyable, but it wasn't for me. I won't be bothering with the rest of the series because I can't find it in myself to care what happens to these characters. Congrats to those who enjoy it, though."

0,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.  With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.  Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.  I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have."

0,"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.  When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.  I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.  PROS: The price is great. The cable is well made and thick Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.  CONS: I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly... (Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)  Side note: Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable."

0,"Lifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock, 1944)  You take a John Steinbeck story, have Jo Swerling (Pennies from Heaven) adapt it, and get Alfred Hitchcock to direct, with a cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and Walter Slezak, among others. How can you not have a hit?  Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way. And that's pretty much what Hitchcock does; each of these characters is invested with a distinct, well-drawn personality, and given the situation, they're bound to clash on their own. Change a camera angle here and there, perhaps, but let the characters do their thing. There's a minimal plot (regarding, of course, the eeeeeeeeevil German-- let's remember this film was released during the darkest days of World War II), but this is a movie that's really about these characters and how they interact with one another. And it's fascinating."

I would seriously recommend this if you were looking for a historical drama that has hints of gore, love and a lot of action!"
0,"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.  For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!  Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.  Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.  These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.  UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling."

Off the top of my head I can't remember if they're 5x5 or 4x4 squares.  Worked well.  We ran out of paint.  The bottles can be refilled.

1,"This book is largely a reflection of the fact that in the history of the art world, the artists have always had the advantage of a solid foundation in the art world. The fact that this book is written in the 60s, 70s and 80s, is a testament to the fact that a lot of artists have the ability to make a significant impact on the art world.  The book deals with the issue of the role of artists in the art world, and how artists can provide a positive impact on the art world.  The book is not about the art world, but about the artists"

Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly. I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room, which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight, and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago. After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant.

1,"My experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible. I went to Chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. This hotel was recommended by the wedding party. It was a terrible choice. Despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. Overall, I would say I was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. On the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. Still, I would not return here again."

I found myself eager to finish dinner or a social outing so I could get back to reading. But alas the last part of the book deteriorated -too many plots, too typical, trying to do too much and tie it all up. I really disliked the character of Genet and the brothers' relationship with her was just too ridiculous for me. I thought she was gone for good and then .... I will say no more- don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this book. And it is well worth reading -I just wish it had ended sooner without all the unnecessary plot ""twists"" in the end. But to learn about another culture and experience the struggles of providing medical care in an impoverished country -- well worth it!"

1,"Temple of Doom is infamous for its suave, yet violent scenes.  The film has a weak plot.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little too much of a hack job.  This movie is still fun to watch.  The only problem with this movie is that the monsters are too scary to be scary.  They're just too big to be scary.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the voice acting.  You'd think that a scary monster would be scary, but it's a little too scary to be scary.  The movie is probably the best part of the movie, especially if you like zombies and vampires.  It's just too scary to be scary.  If you're a fan of the film, then this is probably the movie for you.  You can't go wrong with this one.  You can't go wrong with this one.

0,"Quiet,strong,handsome,shy when it comes to women, has trouble making decisions and the inability to  say ""NO"" to anyone describe this Hot, Hunky, Cowboy version of a tarnished saint. James Taylor sold his ranch in Texas, ended a 3 year relationship to a women he did not love and came home to raise his horses.  Mindy MacAllister has made mistakes and paid the price.  She wants to find someone who will love her despite of her past and raise a family.  When the Taylor brothers Aunt Cappy talks her into coming home, she jumps at the chance hoping to see the one Taylor brother that has held her heart since she was a child.  Nothing worth wild is easy in life and the budding relationship between the two characters is a prime example of this.  Aunt Cappy's meddling, the other tarnished saints not so helpful help and the past that does not want to stay in the past make for an entertaining reading experience. James has a big heart and a lot of love to give and is the first tarnished saint that I have read about who has an almost perfect halo.  If he could just learn to say no and make decisions he could probably ascend and become the first Taylor saint."

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!  This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.  I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.  This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!  Promotional sample provided in exchange for my evaluation and honest, unbiased feedback."

I find it to be a wonderful camera for what I needed:  A camera that had fast, crisp autofocus and could take shots at a speed faster than every 3 or 4 seconds (which seems to be the typical recovery/ready time for most point and shoots in my experience).  Plus, I am rediscovering the joy of artistic photography with this camera.  I'll let the professionals argue over the value and performance for them, but for me, this is a winner!"

0,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.  ""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.  Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.  ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept."

1,"**Slight spoiler alert** Killian is a male lead, with a bit of a history that makes him a bit of a jerk.  The only thing that kept him from making a decision was his desire to go to Europe and not be a part of the mercenary organization he was hired to protect.  He had a lot to learn about the world and the military, and it was a difficult lesson to take for granted.  He learned a lot from the experience, but it was hard to see him as anything other than a jerk.  Kylo, a former Marine, was just a young woman with a background in the military.

0,"Any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. But you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades. Yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. But other things have gone downhill. For the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. Rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. This is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. I, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home."

0,"It is now my go to litter for my cats.  I am traditioning away from the regular Tidy Cat clumping litter in the 35 lb buckets. Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my experience is that the Tidy Cat clumping litter has more dust then the Tidy Cat lightweight litter, and tracks less.  My cats don't show a preference from one over the other, but lugging around 35 lb buckets is making me make a preference.  This lightweight litter actually seems to clump harder.  And when you have to scoop through 3-4"" of litter to remove the clumps, the lightweight litter makes a big difference.  In the past, I have kept 200-300 pounds of litter on hand, now I can have half that weight on hand, which is easier on me.  And yes, litter tracks.  I don't care what type you get, they will manage to track it.  I don't smell urine odor, but feces odor depends on whether the cat decides to bury it or not, or how well."

1,"I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago! I was very pleasantly surprised, as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway, and he usually picks bad places-haha. Anyway, the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. It was busy and the line was a little long, but it moved quickly. The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good, especially since it seemed to be near full. The room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). We made a lot of use of the concierge, since again, it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy! It was also great being near the theater district, and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. My husband is not as easily impressed, but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. Overall, really nice stay in a four star, or probably four and half star hotel!"

0,As it comes it is not much use.  Like others I replaced the sand paper like covering with carpet with double faced tape.  Another negative is that if you are using this in your driveway the thing will slip right off the car unless you are supporting it.  There are no rubber feet or anything to help it grab the surface.  With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot. He is finally getting used to it but it has slipped out from under him twice causing him to be very wary of it.  Not sure how to remedy that.  But when it works it is very helpful. I cannot lift my 10 year old boy into the car and as he ages he (WE) will need it more and more.

0,"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.  The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?  Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end. My pulse quickly dropped after first 20 pages. My hair never raised and as I was reading the climax scene there was no earth movement.  I am sure the movie is coming soon too. If this happens then my hair will surely rise to the occasion."

0,"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.  There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.  The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.  There is a real romance in there!  I did warm up towards Wulfgar. The characters did seem more believable and sympathetic towards the middle of the story. Towards the late middle to the end I could not put it down."

1,"With Mr. Bryson, its not clear what the author's purpose was in writing this book. If he is so inclined, it would be to give readers the opportunity to experience a deeper understanding of the family and its influence in the life of the characters. This is a wonderful book for young people to read as they grow up and develop their own lives and interests. It also provides a good book for adults to read to their children and their families. I loved this book. It was written in a very easy to understand style, and I'm not sure why I was so excited to read it. I like that the story is not over at the end, but the book is written as if it was, and I hope there is a sequel. I also like that it was written in a little more style, as the characters seem more real. I liked how the author used the example of a priest who had a kid with his own problems. I also liked how the author used the word ""con"" to describe the kids. The book was written in a very easy to understand style, and I was excited to read it. I have never read a book that was written in such a simple style, and this book is perfect for that. I will say, I was very impressed with this book. It was very descriptive and well written. I read it because I love the John Grisham series and would love to see this one come to fruition. This was a very easy read, I didn't have to put it down."

The first person point of view felt odd as she seemed to talk to the reader and expressed her thoughts. By reaching to 34% into the e-book there's no romance whatsoever even thought the main character is now in love with her billionaire, and I feel like I know too much about running a grocery store at this time."
0,"Ever bought lettuce or spinach and, after 3 days in the fridge, find that it's turning to a slimy mess?  Got concerns about E. coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens?  If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl. Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water. Agitate it with your (clean, recently washed) hands and let it sit for a few minutes. 2)  Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water. Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand. 3)  Lift the basket and pour out the water, then spin, spin spin. 4)  Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel. 5)  Put the basket back in, lock the spinner down, and store in the fridge. Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge."

0,"For today's standards, this is a nice, functional VCR that I would recommend to anybody who needs one.  But if you are looking for a comparable replacement for your 80s or 90s VCR, you will most likely be disappointed.  This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.  My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.  You can find an excellent one for just $100-150."

0,"My favorite game of all time!  This game is so much fun for adults and kids alike. Some of the younger kids might need a little help but most of them were able to do just fine. You can even always make sure kids get the villager card. I strongly recommend watching a demonstration on youtube on how to play this. (The game seems complicated but don't be afraid. The  best part is that you don't have to memorize anything that the characters do - the narrator tells you as you're playing. )  We tell the kids that they are allowed to lie when they play the game and it kind of worries them to lie at first but then they really get into it and have a lot of fun. :)  You also use the one night ultimate Werewolf free app with this, that narrates the game for you as you go. You can customize it on the app as much as you'd like, including music, the voice, and you can decide which characters to activate during the game. You can also slow the game down significantly for kids or for those learning to play the first time. You can actually download the one night ultimate werewolf app before you buy the game to kind of check it out. Best. Game."
0,Great sander. Like it much better than my old square one that the paper keeps jumping off. It is a little hard to hold - even with my larger hands. But it works great.
1,"I did purchase elsewhere due to the large size and it was a little difficult to get the pet to take it off the leash. The leash is very light and easy to take off and on. The material is very durable and I would recommend it for dogs with heavy hands.Great for the price.  I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog.  I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.  I have a very tough chew toy and this is my second one.  It was very well made and was easy to put together.  I would recommend this for a dog who has a lot of loose hair or loose skin.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a large dog.  One thing that I would like to note is that the description for this collar is very misleading.  There are a few things I can tell you about the collar, but I will be giving it a 5.  The description says that it is ""Upper-collar, upper-collar, lower-collar, dog"

0,"This is turly the film the defines what little good (if any)that came out of the bad war. A story of the few victories the the American forces face. Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troops pay in the first real offensive battle. A platoon was pinned down, and other platoon rush to there rescue, only to be slaughter WWI style, the final battle sence, a classic unrealistic WWII battle charge. But remember this was the very START of the conflict, and we knew little about jungle and gurilla warfare. There was only one thing that cheezed me. It was Moore's (Gibson) remark on the M16. ""It's a good rifle."" Sure the M16A1 was a great rifle, A2 even better, but the oringal M16 by Euegne Stoner (if my history is correct) was a HORRIBLE rifle, it was rumored to be self-cleaning which lead to abuse and missuse. The perellent was dirty and it had to be clean ever fifteen minutes, whole platoons were found with there M16 broken down and cleaning kits out."
0,"I have a medium-sized 60 lb dog who is not an aggressive chewer. He can go through one of these in under 10 minutes, however. He seems to enjoy them quite a bit, so I keep buying them. I've bought several packages so far and I've noticed that in every package, there is a stick or two that smells absolutely AWFUL. The smell for most of the sticks is usually pretty unoffensive but occasionally you get one that stinks to the high heavens. The stinky ones don't seem to give him digestive issues so I guess they're fine, but it is a little weird....  Can someone please comment and tell me why bully sticks are so expensive? Is there a reason or is it because pet companies know owners will pay through the nose for their dogs' enjoyment? Bully sticks are just cow penises after all!"

0,"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power. A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike. It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires). Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree. I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel."

0,"These cheater plugs are great. I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.  It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.  Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.  Since I cannot add reviews for the other ones on their respective pages I will just add the pictures of the others here."

0,"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:  As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.  I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.  Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.  Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.  Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for. Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller."

0,"I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 times and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent.  It has a rubber flap that stays secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increases the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog knows how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stops her from the loud bark. She knows that when she has it on she is off duty.  She calms down immediately when it's on.  It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw results within days.  I have used it now for 3 months and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it.  She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few times until she understood her limits. It was hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never gets shocked any more when I put it on her.  It just helps her relax and keeps her in check. As long as she has it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kids on skateboards, and other barking dogs has ceased.  The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once. It looked better but didn't have enough power to work efficiently. Te only suggestion I have is to offer a few different colors instead of black."

0,"I was looking forward to this dvd. However, was disappointed:  - The presentation could have been better.  The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eyes from following her movement. And in parts she seems too absorbed in following her movements in the mirror in front of her rather than demonstrating a movement to the viewer. - The filming has been done from behind and the sideway. So you don't really get to see a good full view of each movement. And unless you zoom in the dvd player, you can not clearly see a front view of the movements in the mirror in front of which she demonstrates the moves. - The moves are demonstrated in isolation and there is not enough explanations for each movement as if she is careful not to give too much away.  No combination of movements demonstrated.  The performance part is ok, but not as good & natural as she usually is.  The dvd is mostly for beginner's level and doesn't have much originality.  Apart from her choosing good descriptive names for a few of the moves, on the whole this dvd lacks substance as an instructional one."

The one on the left is a regular one and the one on the right is a special one.  The two are very similar.  The one on the left is the one I had last year on my first outing with the gun and my Dad had one of these as a present.  I like that the one on the right is a special one for me and my Dad.  I'm not sure how the design of the gun will work but it's definitely different than the one on the left.  It's a little different from the one on the right but I don't think I can tell if it's a good design.  It's a little different from the one on the left
0,"this really should not come up in the sub category for external hard drive enclosures. This item is meant for use in a bench situation in a hardware shop. The cover is extremely easy to open, so easy that it does not even latch properly, although it has small plastic ridges that seem to indicate it should. You cannot turn it sideways at all; the cover will just flip open. it is also open at the back. if I were still working in a hardware shop, this would be awesome. Its my bad for misreading the title and not looking at all the pictures, but it should really be in a different category. I'm going to return it and get something else for home use."
0,"What a horrible product.  Horrible!  Why would someone sell a product without a valve for inflation?  That is correct.  No valve.  No way to put air in it--it does contain air so it can leak out; and, it does."

1,"What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare. The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they couldn't find my reservation. Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked. The internet service was so slow it was unusable. To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible. Finally, I discovered the valet parking, which was a $49 premium service, dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car. I highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago."
0,"bought this for my 4 grandsons, never saw them have so much fun.  It says for 6+, my grand kids are 5, 4, and twins that are 3.  They can use this without any problem.  This one of the best things I have bought for them.,  Smiles and giggles all the time."
0,"Since we can never have enough umbrellas, I was pleased for the chance to try out the TravelZen umbrella in exchange for my review. {I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion. I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}  This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car."

My daughter is still very young and still plays with it as a toy.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn.Great product for the price!These are great for teaching math.  We are very happy with them!I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this.  He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood.

0,Love the chair. It is a great price and very comfortable. This chair is great for folks with a large bottom ans it is very roomy. The only reason is it not 5 stars is that on soft ground the legs will sink a little. It would of been better if the legs were a curved one piece design.

1,"Very nice hotel, better than expected. The hot breakfast is great in the morning, but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond (even free wine!) The rooms are pretty good size, well furnished, and clean. I liked the view from my room. I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked, was adequate. I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. The staff was friendly and helpful; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
1,GREAT LIGHTS - VERY HAPPY AND VERY TAKENING - WELL WELL
1,"My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown, so he chose the Amalfi Hotel, located conveniently to everything we needed. This place was phenomenal!!! He chose a romantic getaway package, as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever. The hotel is super clean and very chic; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. We were able to bring along our dog, which was also really important to us. The first day we were there, we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage. The masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great. After our massages, we went to the Keefer Steakhouse, which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic. They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill, which was nice as well. In all, our 3 nights there were pretty similar, we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there; I've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City."

0,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales."

0,"Anna Pigeon is a jack of all trades. Not only is she a park ranger with law enforcement training, but she's also an emergency medical technician and a trained firefighter. One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees, but quibbles aside, this is a superb book. Barr uses the drama of a fire to isolate her cast of characters in classic locked-room mystery fashion, then cuts them off from the outside world while Anna races against time to figure out who she can trust before she becomes the next victim. If there's a flaw it lies in the fact that a vital clue is a bit too obvious. I can't say more without giving away too much, but people who've read lots of mysteries will probably figure out part of what's going on simply from the way the story is constructed. Firestorm, however, is really a story of fire, firefighters, and the southern Cascades in the vicinity of Mt. Lassen National Park, and minor imperfections in the mystery barely detract from it at all. Highly recommended."
1,"We bought our 4 1/2 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves this little guy!  It is so cute and the details are perfect.  The plastic is sturdy and it is easy to put together.  It is a great gift for any child with an interest in toys.  We have 2 8-month old twins and they love to play with it.  It is made of very high quality materials and it is made to last.  It is well made and will last for years to come.  The little guy will chew on it for hours, and it is a great addition to any kitchen.  This is a great gift for any child who enjoys playing with their little ones.I'm a huge collector of Thomas the Train, and this is an awesome addition to my collection.  This toy is pretty much as advertised, and I'm glad I got it.  The track is a little small, but my kids love to play with it.  It's a great way to play with other Thomas pieces, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Thomas pieces."

0,"Elsa Quinn has been bullied her whole life, not just the kids at school but her mothers constant harping on weight loss has finally reached a boiling point.  Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Elsa joins a gym preparing to exercise the weight off.  Noah Stewart drives to another town to workout, as a football jock at school he gets inundated with his friends wanting to hang out while at the gym and he just wants to focus on working out.  When he sees Elsa, he wants to know why she is there, sure he has seen her at school but he wonders if she will tell people he is here.  Elsa though surprises him and realizing she has no plan, he offers to help her out.  At first Elsa questions Noah's intentions but realizes he has never been part of the bullying she accepts.  Noah doesn't plan on falling for Elsa though and he does, Elsa though is afraid of what going public will do.  I liked this a lot.  Noah's view on why Elsa is trying to lose weight is not what you would think.  Elsa is vulnerable, her mother is a class act and I can understand Elsa's choices.  Great read."

0,"Perhaps it was bad luck for V. Hislop that I came to this book immediately after Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue - now there's someone whose characters zing off the page, from whose pen flows effortlessly great prose and who can put together a damned good story. None of  which, sadly, applies to Ms Hislop. OK, so I might have been dazzled by Telegraph Avenue, but I think that even if I'd read The Thread close on the heels of say, a thoroughgoing perusal of the phone book, the latter would shine by comparison. I think that Ms Hislop intended The Thread to be a peon to Thessaloniki which is, I'll grant her, a great little city. But it never comes to life; if there is such a thing a taxidermic prose, Ms Hislop can do it. Poor old Thessaloniki is just a one-dimensional sketch under her hand, a stage set about which she poses a cast of cliched cardboard cutouts (the Nazi's mouth is 'thin' - aren't they always? - the protagonist's bad husband is fat and smelly; the university students are all intellectual firebrands. Etc etc). There are far better books than this about this area and this period. For example, anyone who wants a great fictional account of the sack of Smyrna should read Jerusalem Poker (Edward Whittemore), or Middlesex (Jeffrey Eugenides) or Birds without Wings (Louis de Berniers) while Alan Furst's Spies of the Balkans brings pre-war and wartime Thessaloniki beautifully alive in a way that Ms Hislop could only dream about. Don't waste your time with this book. Read something good."

I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.  I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.  I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.  I fell completely in love with the concept of snow globe moments. It reminds you to always be present in the experiences while you're in them and to always look for adventure and joy."

1,"My husband and I made a reservation at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, for a much needed weekend getaway. We took off work early Friday to beat traffic. Once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking. We drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel. Upon checking in we were informed that the floor, where our room was located, was in the process of having the carpets cleaned. We decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation. We took the elevator, which smelled like urine, up to our room. We did see some carpet cleaning machines, unattended, in the hallway. I hoped for the sake of safety, no children were staying on this floor. We walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine. The overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us. We called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms. He rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings. Just then, the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and I could not hear anything else my husband said. We decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel. It was an awful experience."

0,"I can't fathom how the glowing reviews on this product could possibly be real. I just received mine yesterday, just in time to pick my cat up from the vet, after having surgery.  I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.  The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.  I would NOT recommend buying this carrier. I've had it for 24 hours, and it already looks like it's years old."

0,"Mine is the Night by Liz Curtis Higgs is set in historic Scotland in the 1700 circa and based on the book of Ruth.  I had not read other book before reading ""Mine is the Night"", but I really don't think it mattered. I had a hard time getting into the book at first. It took me several chapters before I really started enjoying it, but once I got into it I loved it and had a hard time putting it down. Now it may have just been me and not having a lot of time to put into it at first and not just the material itself. The author did an excellent job of researching the area and the subject material. It is a true love story: a daughter-in-laws love for her mother-in-law but mostly her love of God. She devoted her life to God and He led her paths and because of her devotion she was blessed beyond anything she could imagine. The characters were real and believable, the setting was beautifully described and the story was wonderful. The book was pretty long to read and took me a while to get through it but part of that was the limited amount of time I had to spend on it.  Although it was long after the first few chapters it kept my attention and drew me in.  This is the first book I have read by Liz Curtis Higgs but it will not be my last. She is truly an amazing author. If you love historical romance novels you will love this one and you must put it on your list of great books to read. This book was provided to me by Waterbrook/Multnomah for free in exchange for an honest review."

I stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations I expected plus more. I was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle. The restaurants at the Fairmont were amazing as well. When staying at this Hotel, food and wine at their best are portrayed. If I had to make the choice to stay here again, the only thing that I would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long (it was so relaxing!!). Already booked another stay for next year I enjoyed it so much."

0,"I've done my research on cavy food.  And from all that i have read, I know this is quality guinea pig food. I have a 7y/o piggie I rescued/adopted and she was always fed the junky kind of pellet food with all the colorful treats in it.  She became a big of a fatty. For awhile, I kept buying the same food for her b/c I knew that is what she was always fed and it was what she was used to.  Now that she's older, I really wanted to make sure she is getting quality food without all the junk treats.  and the verdict....She doesn't like it.  She won't hardly touch this stuff.  We've had it for a month, and she squeals at us, like we are not paying attention to her.  But I know this is the best food for her longevity.  So I will continue to feed it to her. She will get used to it. I would recommend this for your piggie if she is young and not tainted yet with the junky treat filled pellets."

It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

I am very happy with this purchase.  Pros: -Good quality; -Low cost; -Excellent;  Cons: -Does not have a multi function button; -Wish list;  This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.

0,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew. Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it."

0,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!  Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either."

They sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. At my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. Don't book this hotel in the summer.

0,Almost bought a Yeti but then found out that Pelican made a US cooler. Super solid almost tactical build. But the coolest part about it which I discovered later is that standard steam table pans fit perfectly in the cooler. I use a 1/3 X 6'' deep pan to keep meat and cheese out of the ice. The lip of the pan rests in a groove near the top of the cooler and keeps the pan above the ice. It slides easily side to side to access below it without removing the pan. Very slick. 1/2 pans would work well too. The pans come in 2'' 4'' & 6'' depths. I have the 35qt. But the pans should work in the 45 & 65qt. since they all seem to have the same dimension from front to rear. See my user photo. Note the weight of this cooler. It is not a trivia item.

0,"This was one of the best books I have read this year. Not only is I Let You Go a fast paced physiological thriller it's also a intimate portrail of tragedy, loss, survival, and emotional undoing. Jenna is a young woman struggling to survive after a very traumatic accident. Im exhausted but I don't dare close my eyes. When I sleep Im assaulted by the sights and sounds of the accident; by the knowledge that had I been just a few minutes earlier, it would never have happened Jenna feels responsible for the tragedy and won't allow herself to find joy in anything as she feels she doesn't deserve it. She moves to a small town in Welsh to try and put her life back together. While there she is withdrawn from everyone and everything. Eventually she finds a small amount of happiness in taking photographs. About half way through the book their is a major twist that I for one did not see coming. The author portrays Jenna in such a way that you actually feel like you are in the book with her. The book is a devastatingly real look at how tremendous tragedy and guilt can affect every aspect of ones life to the point it can be debilitating. I could say more but I don't want to give anything away. This story is so much more than a physiological thriller and I recommend everyone read it."

Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).  It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.  Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.  The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.  (A-Flow provided me with a sample of their product for review)"
0,"I don't like  this Evan character involvement in book 2. I Loved, loved , loved  book one. But I feel like the Evan character in this book 2 story,  is an intrusion into what was a freaking perfect romance. I read book 2 last year and was too mad about this permanent three- some development  to leave a review. Give us some warning."

0,"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.  Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday."

1,This is an outstanding historical novel. The characters are well developed and the plot is well developed. The story is told from the point of view of the reader. This book is very interesting and it is well worth the time. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in history.This is a fast read with a great twist. I had to wait a few days to finish it. I was quite surprised to see that the author is now a professor of history at UC Berkeley. I am very happy to be a part of her work. I am also very happy to be a part of the team that provided the documentation that allowed us to review the book. We were very excited about this book as it was well worth the time it took to read.

0,"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.  It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.  The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.  On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.  Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.  I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure."
1,"This is a severely overpriced cable. The quality is just too good to be true. I'm not a big fan of the plastic, but it is the cable that makes it so much better. It is hard to get good sound out of it. This cable is excellent.Great for the price.  I have a portable player and I can't wait to use it as a portable music player.  This is not a big deal for me, because I have a very portable player that I can play back on my laptop, but I really like the fact that I can just listen to my music on it.  I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working fine.I have been using this to my 3DS and I can tell that it works well and has a great picture.  It is very small and I can't find a very good picture.  I would not recommend this product to anyone who does not want to use a 3D printer.

1,"My wife and I booked a room at the Hilton Chicago three weekends ago, as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel. We were expecting some minutia of luxury. However, this was not the case with the Hilton Chicago. First, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. Now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. Second, we had to change our room key twice. The room keys they used supposedly lost their 'charge'. This is what the front desk told us. So, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. This was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. Lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. We knew this was accurate, but I always check just in case. But two weeks later when I checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. I had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. Suffice it to say we will not be staying there again."

Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. I recommend going early. The rooms were quiet and clean. I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days. We would stay here again. Parking is expensive, about $28/day. It is valet. The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites (3 different cities). I have had a great experience each time."

0,"Another fun product for my bird to play with. He really likes the bell on the end and he's drawn to the colorful spheres. The reason I took a star off is that the area where the hook connects to the top sphere is very loose. The whole toy pops off of the hook frequently with very little pulling, sometimes they fall off just trying to hang it in the cage. In the end the bird still plays with it and he enjoys it, so it's not a super big deal. Overall, a fun toy for my cockatiel, even if it doesn't stay connected to the hook."

The construction is very sturdy. The material is soft and plush. I will probably buy another one. If I had to guess, I'd say this is the best dog bone I've found for the price. This is a great product for dogs that need something to chew on. I love that it is made in the USA. I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 lb. lab mix, and I like this collar to allow him to chase his prey, and also to let him know when he is ready to return. It also seems to help him get a good grip on the leash. I would recommend this collar for dogs who need to be able to stay in a leash. I have a large dog, and he is always chasing after his prey. He is very strong, and this collar is a great option for him. He is also very playful with it. It is very easy to adjust, and he gets to it quickly."
1,"For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor (think Motel 6 at a Hilton price). Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin. They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks, so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of. For the prices they charge ($350.average price for two people). It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby, which was happening while I stayed, could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms. But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests, which I won't be."

0,"In a world of Elena's, Sookie's, Bella's and Buffy's it is refreshing to have a somewhat campy novel about vampires that isn't all blood and lust.  Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.  This story really reminds me of the early Queen Betsy books - you know the GOOD ones - and is a funny yet engaging tale that kept me entertained the entire read.  I really hope that this turns into a series as Queen Betsy should just be staked already and I'm looking for a new fun series to take its place."

0,"This is a very good LED lamp for the price. Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.  Pros: The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base. The light is very steady and there is no flicker. The controls are easy to learn and access. The finish is nice. The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications. The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles. The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.  Cons: The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base. The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish. The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in. The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.  I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not. But at least you never have to change a light bulb! Good value for money and a recommended product."

0,"My ferret loves this Vitamin Supplement! I love this product and have purchased it for almost 5 years and will continue to purchase it for the well-being of my girl.  I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.  This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.  What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.  I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too."

1,"easily the worst mode selectors on the market. I will admit that I have been using the other two. The first, which is designed to be a more powerful flashlight, is just as powerful as the one I replaced. The second is a compact, high-powered, and a bit smaller than the one I replaced. The combination of these features makes this flashlight a great value for the money. I am not sure if I will ever buy another one. I have had no problems with the flashlight. I will update this review as I receive more information. Thanks!Good quality, great price. Seems like a great product. I bought these to replace my old garage door opener with this one. I had a different one for my home and was looking for a different one. I used the same brand and found this one. It was very well made and was easy to install.

0,"So far I'm really liking this hard case. I got it for my AK-47. I initially was looking for a soft case in the 25 to 35 dollar range,  but had trouble finding one that could hold the long 30 round AK mags in their pouches. I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can fit my rifle with scope and a magazine inserted into it's well. As my picture shows, there is room for extra mags also. One thing that I like is that when it's closed, the soft foam really compresses around the rifle and holds it in place. I have shook the case and swung it around and upon reopening it, everything was still in the the original positions that I had placed them in. You also get nylon straps that you can screw into the case with the provided screws to secure your rifle. Honestly, I don't think that i will put them in because  of the aforementioned reason,  although it certainly wouldn't hurt. There are four plastic locking tabs that keep the case closed and there are also places to put pad locks on if one should choose to. Overall, pleased with this case as it serves my purposes."

The cover is easy to change and the bottom is pretty straight forward too. The bottom cover is really nice and easy to change. The front and back cover are a little more bulky but they work well and cover most of the area around the outlet. The back cover is also nice and easy to change.

The pictures are very sharp and close cropping is not a problem. And I like the red color."
0,"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third person, sometimes I found it a little confusing. Okay, I admit it, I'm not a young man anymore and maybe my short term memory isn't what it used to be.....  :) Erickson began each chapter with the name of the character telling it, so I guess the confusion wasn't the author's fault.  Anyway, I often like romance stories where opposites are attracted to each other. Jay and Quinn are very different but alike in many ways too. The plot contains a fair share of tension but I likes how the guys dealt with it.  Out of Frame was proofed well, and the Kindle formatting was very good on my iPad. This book is definitely on my 'recommend' list for those who like this genre!"

That was horrible.  So I'm back to this one again, and we can connect them all together to form a huge marble run. We're having a lot of fun with this.

0,"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.  But boy, I could not have been more wrong.  This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.  (Just don't leave it standing in your living room if you have cats.  Because it I discovered it works pretty well as a scratching post, too!)"

0,"My girl, who is 7, is in that ""mommy"" stage and really wanted this doll. It might be good for younger children, but at her age it just wasn't a good match. As some others have mentioned, the clothing does not come off. A huge part of the fun, at least with my child, is dressing up her dolls in different outfits. Also, because of the way the clothing is sewn on, it does not lift up far enough for you to really put the diaper up around the doll's bottom. So the diaper was a waste as well. The quality of the doll's hair was horrible! She looked like she was going bald! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a Baby Alive. At least you can change their clothes, they actually have real looking diapers (not like this one which was a thin piece of cloth, not even resembling a diaper) and they actually eat and drink. This one may be a hit with younger toddlers but not for girls who are older than 5. And even at that, I would NOT pay $45+ dollars for this. It should be $20 at the most."

0,"The seat is easy to install and aesthetically pleasing. Toddler seat is stable. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the seat is very flat. There is no rise or ""horn"" in the front. When you have a newly potty trained toddler, they don't always understand leaning forward or making sure their privates are right over the hole, especially when they are trying to balance on top of a tall toilet. This problem applies to both a boy (especially) and a girl. If you have a squirmy toddler, the chances of peeing onto the top of the toilet seat is pretty high. My recommendation to the company is to add a contoured toddler seat. This seat is probably best used with an older toddler who understands the concept of being over the hole with no guidance from a contoured seat. We're returning ours."

0,"I was a big fan of the Dinobots as a young child growing up in the 80s. My favorites were Grimlock and Snarl, but Slag was the first one I owned and he still has a special place in my heart because of this. Well, the Bey-verse Slug is NOT my Slag. This Transformer is much smaller and is brightly decked out in purple and red colours instead of silver, gold and gray. As much as some older TF fans like myself may want to compare AoE Slug to classic Slag, it really is apples and oranges. That said, if you WANT a Dinobot closer to your childhood memories, do a google search for FanToys Scoria. This third party Slag looks like the original but has the articulation and poseability of a modern Transformer. It'll also set you back two hundred bucks, so this $9.99 Slug may sound better and better after that revelation  Slug (SLAG!) is a pretty easy transformer to well, transform. His modes are pretty easy and obvious to shift from one to the other. The Dinosaur (triceratops) looks fine if a bit garish. My wife likes how colourful he is and once you get past the G1 Dinobot paint scheme that is more than likely embedded into your head, you'll be okay with it. Paradigm shift people!  Robot mode is where Slag falls apart. Part of it is indeed my own preconceived notions. it's weird having the triceratops head as shoulder pads instead of a helmet for example. Other parts are just bad design. Slug's robot head is just kind of a blob amdhis front dino legs are just hanging out on his side in robot mode, making Slug look more like Shiva than a Dinobot.  So all in all, the price point is nice and when you get past the G1 expectations in your head, the dino mode of Slug is pretty decent for a Bey-verse figure but the robot mode is really lacking. We'll call it a thumbs in the middle here."
1,"A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday. The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming. But, We quickly found out that was not the case. Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in. The bathroom was filthy, it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks!! There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror. There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room. We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly, unkempt room. The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling 'was not smoke' because that is not permitted in the hotel. We were also told that room was cleaned that day. After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager, we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time. WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us. The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced. Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there. All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests. I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one."

0,"The Lego Connoisseur Here, Reviewing the Snowspeeder.  True to my beliefs, we picked this up for $25.00 at Legoland.  Less than $0.10 a brick!  Believe it or not, we bought this for a three year old, hey it was Legoland and we were in the moment!  Probably should of known better all things considered...This Lego set feels very strong when built--durable even, through many battle simulations it has survived harsh environments and many gun shots!  Until his other brother shot it down with a fanfare of no other.  Not recommended for little kids since most battles end with a request for a rebuild, much to parents dismay.  However the largest one (ahem...) loves this Lego Star Wars Set.  First, it is a relatively older set.  I remember it when I was boy.  My friend had it (and all the other ones too).  Tons of fun, decent instructions to go along with it, but not quite as user friendly as the newer more, ""step by step"" instruction designs.  This felt more true to the old movie than many other sets without as many custom parts as those tend to have.  Plus Luke, with a light-saber is always awesome.  The few complaints I have is related to the cockpit...There really isn't enough room.  I wish they had built it up a little more so that the fighters could sit up straight.  I also which that Luke had some spot to put his light-saber in the cockpit.  I think the spring-shooting darts are a bit too sensitive, they went off several times without much input from me.  And finally, the little shooter by the grappling hook can easily fall out and it isn't exactly the easiest piece to put back on."

It is easy to use and does not seem to be a problem at all. It will work in your car if you have a lot of space. I bought this for my older iPad and it is perfect."

1,Not my typical sort of book. The characters are just too real. There is a lot of violence and so much emotion in this story.
0,"Loved this book. Jo is a college student trying to live her life.  However, she is hiding a very big secret. She is in hiding and has been for the last 3 years.  Kian was the rich boy who had everyone's attention.  He was the it boy and ran the with in crowd.  He took notice of Jo (Jordan) in high school and learned of her terrible secret.  Jo was being tortured by her foster father.  One day he took it too far and Kian was there to save Jo.  However, that resulted in the death of Jo's foster father.  Kian claimed self defense, but he was sentenced to prison.  No one wanted to hear Jo's story and she was persecuted as the victim.  This caused her to go into hiding.  Two years later, Kian is released.  Jo's life is about to take a dramatic turn.  Kian is coming and he want's Jo. This book was great.  I loved the dynamic between Jo and Kian.  The storyline was intense and the supporting characters had depth and added to the intensity of the main characters.  Highly recommended."

1,"I have to thank the Ambassador East Hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. We never leave our dog at home when we travel, and it's been a long time since we've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. The staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. My husband liked the fitness room. It was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. It was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago. We would make the trip just to stay here. That's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel."

0,"I absolutely love this product. It is sturdy, easy to put together, easy to use, does the job perfectly and  has saved so much time for the family (instead of standing there spraying tons of water everywhere). My 5 fur-babies (4 small and 1 ""large"" , but lets not tell her that), make a mess in my front yard and since I am the one who cuts the grass and uses all the tools for yard maintenance, this has been a savior. Now to get down to brass tacks; the customer service is beyond wonderful. The company sent an e-mail inquiring if I received the product and informed me of a How-To Video. The video was great and made using the product super easy. Stacy, the founder of Tidy Turd, is such a pleasure to talk to ( or write to really). I inquired about additional bags because my ""large"" pup makes a 'large"" mess. She was responsive in a very fast time, super friendly and understanding. She informed me that bags would be available for purchase coming up soon and to join the VIP club for special offers (which I did as soon as I received the first e-mail) and that she would be sending me some baggies to hold me over until available for purchase. I have no affiliation to this company or anyone who works/worked/etc with this company, however, I do believe that when there is a product that is a great price, works how it is suppose to AND has AMAZING customer service, a detailed review is warranted. I will be recommending this product to all my friends, co-workers and neighbors and will do so without hesitation. I have attached photos of the product so you can see it in ""real life"". If you have any questions, feel free to contact me anytime. My Amazon profile is: https://www. amazon."

The original battery never ran out of power, but I couldn't review all the photos and 720p movies because I was concerned about using all the original battery power.  This battery is identical to the original and is a genuine Canon battery. Works and looks just like the original battery that came with the camera.  The battery was shipped two weeks sooner than the estimated delivery date.

0,"Pros:  Light and durable.  won't hurt if get beaned by pitching machine.  Good for young kids to learn to catch, gain confidence with flyballs, without risk of getting hurt if ball hits them in face or hands.  For older players, great for pitching machine that is designed for lite-flight balls and can tilt, to throw breaking balls.  Cons:  Used in pitching machine, at high speeds, the balls will tend to rise.  For someone manually throwing batting practice, these balls are hard for a person to throw a curve."

I had heard of Shape Mags Stick N Stack before, but honestly, I just wasn't sure the quality would be as good as Magna-Tiles. I'm so glad we gave them a chance!  We now have so many more shapes to work with! We can build vehicles, houses with windows, and so much more! They are just as sturdy and strong as Magna-Tiles, but cheaper!  The only downside is that the magnets only line up on one size, so occasionally you'll need to flip a piece for it to connect. But that small issue won't keep us from building lots of fun creations!"

The instructions are pretty clear and I just can't get over how awesome and easy it is to simply place the device in a cup of water. Growing up, we always had the huge R2D2-style contraptions posted up in our hallway during the winter months - given that it was in a house made sense but it was always a pain to refill. This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too. Once it's plugged in and you hit the power button, a nice, steady mist comes out.  I am just in love with Deneve products...they always seem to have fun stuff!"

0,"You ever get sick of having to pay top dollar for a rechargeable battery? I know I do. But that is the reality and I am not willing to have to buy a whole new drill rig because it seem more economically feasible to do so instead of buying a battery that is about half the cost.  Well with this Pwr+ second market battery you don't have to any longer. After getting a case of sticker shock at the local Home Depot for a replacement battery for my DeWalt drill I thought there had to be options. There are and I found it right here.  Now there are multiple batteries available on Amazon for the DeWalt drill. So, how did I settle on this Pwr+ battery. I spent some time reading the product reviews and ultimately found that this particular aftermarket brand had high ratings and pleased customers that stated the battery not only charged well, but lasted as well.  For less than $30, I purchased this battery and received it within two days. (I have Amazon Prime). It charged and worked as I expected it to. You cannot go wrong with this battery and it has served me well thus far."

0,"This book presented a business parable which provided a nice framing device for the principles on how to be a Go-giver instead of a Go-Getter. The story is a vehicle to share the Authors 5 Laws of Stratospheric Success which involve expressing gratitude, and being generous to others.  The lessons were a good reminder that getting ahead in business (or anything else worthwhile) does not have to come at the expense of others and the value of networking.  If did feel that the narrative got a little to wrapped up in how clever the author felt the mysteries of identities of the The Connector and the Friday Guest were. The author also used the lesson of appearances can be deceiving to justify several contrived relationships between characters, which made the ending feel somewhat forced.  A very feel good story with a good theme but the narrative itself suffered."

0,"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.  There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?  At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.  There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.  The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.  The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.  If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.  Was it perfect?  No, but it came close."

0,"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.  A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.  Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.  All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost."

I had to return it. I had a 2 year old cat and it stopped working. I ordered another one for her and it will continue to work. I have a dog and she loves it. She will play fetch with it and it is easy to put on and off. I am very happy with it. I just wish it lasted longer. I am glad I bought it because it is a great product. It is a very good quality product and I would recommend it to anyone. I have a Yorkie and she had a hard time with it. It took her a few weeks to get used to it. I gave it to her and she was so happy. It is good for her. It is not hard and she is not a picky eater. It is easy to put on and off. She would eat it very quickly and it was easy to put on and off.

0,This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.

The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected. When you enter your room the decor catches your eye. Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it. The restroom tub is large and made of marble. The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while.

I would not buy again. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary. I'm glad I found this. I have used this for a couple of months now. It is very easy to use and to set up. It is very quiet. I have had no problems with the rain fly catching the rain from my car. I would recommend this to anyone. My only complaint is that the handle is a little snug. I use this to hold a 5 pound bow and it is good."

I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews. My husband and I both work 12hr days so having a crockpot meal or two a week is a life saver. I definitely recommend this crockpot if you love a good hot ready to eat meal when you walk through the door at the end of hard day."

I prefer Thinkpad keys, but are getting used to the new Apple keyboard without any problem.  No difference really with the extended wired keyboard that comes with the new imac in terms of feel.  The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...  The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).  This problem doesn't go away when you quite VMWare.  I have to plug in the wired keyboard and mouse to continue.  A bit of annoyance, but won't be a problem if you don't use VMWare to run Windows.  Hope this helps."

0,"I booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile Christmas Lights Parade. I chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed. We arrived at our hotel around 3:30 PM to check in. We came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 3:00 PM. After giving him our name, the manager said,'OK, we have your king smoking suite available'. We quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room. He insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room. We went back and forth, then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation. Luckily, we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone. It clearly said non-smoking. After showing him our reservation, he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available. So why in the world did he need to see our reservation!! We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children. The manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed. We canceled our room reservation. We live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home. My family was very disappointed. My husband is a gold member with Hilton. Let's just say we will be switching back to Marriott. The hotel lobby was dated. The smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well. They made an error and never owned up to it, nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience."

0,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com  I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.  Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.  The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.  It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.  I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story."

Then out of no where Ting I made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel I found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob I was living in paradise after I got into my room it was a perfect! The room was a perfect 68 degrees. I was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was... perfect! And it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when I didn't think it could get any better I look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold!

0,"Overall - 2.5 stars You can have the werewolf and eat the cheesecake too. This is a BBW paranormal romance with all the usual elements.  Fantasy World - 2 stars The world is a bit ragged around the edges, and you'll definitely need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the story.  Tingle - 3 stars A hot, naked man shows up on the doorstep, and wants to get busy. What's not to like? The sheik scene is more odd than hot though.  Characters - 3 stars Full of hot, Alpha werewolf stereotypes. Carole's self-esteem issues become tiresome, and I desperately wanted her to get a clue.  Story - 2 stars The plot is a well worn path. Nothing new, but it's still fun to take a stroll down it.  Summary When Carol Anne goes to claim a surprise inheritance from her dead Uncle, she doesn't know it includes a sexy man showing up on her doorstep to provide erotic delights. She's trying to recover from her divorce, and plans to live alone in the country. Unfortunately, Carol Anne doesn't know she's actually close to a hidden werewolf town, and is smack in the middle of a fight between werewolves and panthers.  My Wolf King by Rose Wynters is a fairly standard paranormal romance with familiar elements. It's not going to rock your world, but is more like snuggling into your favorite sweats with a side of cocoa and cookies. You get to visit with hot men who know their mates at once, and a real sized woman who is valued for being more than a twig."

0,"Should have watched the video posted with the still pics for this toy.  In the pics, especially where the boy is kneeling, there is no background.  Because of this you can't tell that the toy MUST be attached to a wall to work.  See those yellow brackets (one is mid-circle on the right)?  The set comes with sticky pads that go on the backs of these yellow brackets, to attach them to the wall.  My son doesn't have enough open wall space in his room to use this.  Had to send it back.  But, I'm GLAD there was not enough wall space.  After watching the videos, the power boost, or whatever it's called, just makes the car go around and around.  NO interaction by the kids playing!  They just sit there and watch.  Check out one reviewers video for a quick experience of this toy.  The car goes around so fast you can't even see it!  Not the kind of Hot Wheel experience I want for my son.  Also, one reviewer said it was difficult to set up.  Not sure you'd WANT to break it down due when the child is done playing with it due to the difficulty factor AND due to the fact that it's stuck to the wall.  I prefer toys that you can put away after the child is done using it."
0,"I really liked this book. I am an avid reader and would recommend adding this book to your must read list. Another book that really impressed me is Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect, by Tiffany Snow, pub. 2003. In this time of  increasing awareness for the need to help our relationships, workplace, family, self and environment, these two books are at the forefront of giving us the tools to do so - not only by positive reinforcements, but in the case of  ""Psychic Gifts,"" showing we have a Divine birthright to access the supernatural in our lives, and how to tap into that. I encourage you to Keep Reading, apply what you learn, and be a force for good in your part of the world."
0,"I'd been searching for a cool, non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. I thought I'd found a winner in the Affinia... SOO disappointed!! In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults, we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed. What?! I was floored, but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride, was too tired to make a fuss. We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night, so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. I was told that room service would call ME back to take my order...and nothing happened. I didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs. Nothing special; entree, dessert and NAB for two still came out to $*...I am no hayseed, I'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago, but this just wasn't worth it. Our room was by the elevator w/ parking garage view...the bathroom was tiny, shower curtain was stained, funky toilet seat/lid, and the vanity featured that 'rude awakening' lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms, i.e., 'Holy crap, have I looked that bad this whole time?!' If you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker, they charge for their chintzy coffees (I don't use these, but... come on). Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar, but weak drinks... That night, our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms. But the Marathon was that weekend; the hotel was so busy I didn't want to be a pest. I can't believe I was so impressed with this place online. Next time I'll happily pay more to stay someplace that's actually a treat."
0,"My rabbits are crazy about this food! I am wondering what the little orange shapes are in it because my boys are climbing all over me in the morning to get to them. They even dig through their dish to look for the mystery morsels. It's definitely something other than the actual pellet food in a different shape & color. Too bad there weren't more of these in the food, as I like to give them healthy treats once in awhile.  The stores where I usually purchase this bun food have stopped carrying it, and I am very happy that I found it on Amazon! My boys are even happier than I am! Timothy pellets are the best and healthiest for them, and most of the stores carry the alfalfa pellets or some junk with the first ingredient called ""wheat midlings."" I want my boys' urinary tracts to be healthy, not gunked up with calcium and other deposits.  Along with their daily greens and veggies, timothy grass/hay, they will always have their yummy Fori-Diet!"

0,"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected.  Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.  And if you want old school writing by a woman who was contemporary with the whole WWI era, Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series are usuaaly in print."

It covers not only infantry, cavalry, artillery but also naval warfare. The book gives numerous lively examples and accounts about the different achievements of each arm. One can find numerous battles explained with maps, each detailing the successes of a particular use of cavalry, artillery or infantry.  This little book does extremely well in its own modest and pedagogical way what others more convoluted writings fail to achieve: inspire!  As a conclusion: a well written and engaging entry level book.

What a fun love story this is!! Thinking her ""love"" life is done and over, Jordon isn't ready for her reaction to Blake. Upon meeting him she is rude and outright mean to him. It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself. Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is.

It took me 2 minutes to read the whole book.  Each page has no more than a paragraph of large text and the adjoining page has a black and white illustration. I think the illustrations are the star of the book and probably why so many people enthuse over it. But really, there's no moral, no point, and it doesn't even make sense (how is Ferdinand the biggest and strongest bull when literally all he ever does is sit and smell flowers?)  I know it's a work for children, so I wasn't expecting much, but I was disappointed at how simple and pointless the work seems.

The bed, although not horrible, was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home, and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. I was traveling for business, and although not dressed in formalwear, was also not dressed down, but all in all, it felt a bit pretentious to me. There are better options for the money, and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place, Sheraton Towers, or Trump for the similar price and better stay. I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings......not #1 in Chicago, in my book."

0,"This book was like a breath of fresh air after decades of being immersed in the increasingly bizarre Niagara of conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination.  Posner did what no one thought possible, he drained a swamp.  Sticking to meticulous verifiable fact and going back to first sources Posner asserts that the truth was there all along.  His reading style is easy, moving along and building up the facts bit by bit.  What Posner shows is that these theories often collapse under the weight of their own Byzantine thinking.  I still reread it occasionally just to enjoy a careful mind making a logical case out of a morass of nonsense."

0,This is a good cage if you can get if for the price that Amazon is selling it. Unfortunately I payed more in stores. This cage is 5 pieces that fit pretty loosely together. It is a good home for Pinto or Robo Hamsters 2in or less. I have an outhouse attached to one of the two side holes. The water bottle should probable be replaced. It just has a open hole unlike the water bottles that have a ball that does not leak. The wheel pretty loud too. I recomend the silent wheel. It's so quiet! Anyways this is a good cage for the price.
0,"I was looking for a good way to refrigerate wine bottles that are partially empty. If you put a stopper in them and stand them up in the fridge door, they clank and jostle around when you open or close the fridge. And if you lay them on their sides, there's always the chance the stopper you're using won't be as secure as you'd hoped, and you end up with a leaky mess. This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."

0,"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.  Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.  Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people."

1,"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip. I elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade. All I can say is, 'What upgrade?' It's barely anything above what you get normally. And for the price I paid, I was expecting much better acommodations. Because I arrived around 10:30 the night I checked in (delayed flight) I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. I find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. Beyond that, it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. First it was a room mix-up, then it was a missing key card. That was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning. Speaking of the next morning, the complimentary breakfast was a joke. When I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast, I'll stay at the next Super 8 I find. And the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. I will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago. This tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot."

Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that: 30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.  Would love to hear comments/clarifications on this."

This isn't a carry on from that, its a stand alone book in its own right. Its taken me today to sit down and read this lovely enjoyable read. Susanne never disappoints her readers, yet another thumbs up from me."

But, it's so dang funny -- And, you'll actually root for the serial killer, who's not all that bad.  You absolutely must have a sense of humor to read Dorsey.  It's not cartoon-y, more of a futuristic Keystone cops on bad dope, perhaps?  Anyway, the Florida historical information is rich and believable and Dorsey includes enough truth in his work to make you think maybe the Sunshine state residents are sniffing the Coppertone a bit too enthusiastically.  If you need an escape and can't afford a plane ticket or the time to get away, try this book (or any of the other Dorsey novels) and you'll emerge refreshed and perhaps a bit stunned, but you'll know you've been somewhere."

Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I got to the end,and thought, ""Well, not a whole lot actually happened."" Sure there's a big ending that leaves everything hanging, but getting there made much of the book feel like set up for what has to be a nearing conclusion to the series. However, the series as a whole, I think, is one of the best out there right now for kids and adults alike."

0,"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats."

This is such a good story with a whole lot of potential,but the need for better editing takes that away. This is sexy sensual romance between two very stubborn and strong willed people. The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe. I love the action between these two characters,I just wish for a tad bit more story and a little more from the supporting cast. The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings. This was a really good solid story,one you can not regret reading. I would love to see a revised version and it be released if possible and with a not so abrupt ending."

0,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!   Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.   Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.   One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.   Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.   After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.   The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON! Enjoy <3"

0,"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.  1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely. 2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.  I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice."

0,"A little deeper than most. In addition to the plot, it examines the aftermath of extreme emotional cruelty (as well as physical abuse) to a wife at the hands of her husband; the doubts and insecurities of a hero who therefore seems more genuine than the usual ""tall, dark, and brooding""; and an old lady in the throes of dementia, possibly Alzheimer's. This book tends toward the inner life of the characters over the action, but the various relationships feel genuine. There is a mystery that could have had more detailed development for my taste, but there was a sufficiently evil villain, a thrilling confrontation and a resolution. I found this book because I was laughing at the various offerings of sex scenes wrapped in imitation stories and was sure this would be one of those, based on the bare chested man on the cover. The description intrigued me and I am happy to have stumbled upon it. Although there is sex, it is not the focus, so it doesn't detract from the story."

0,"I purchased this doll for my 2 year old daughter to help her transition into being a big sister.  I plan on wearing it in a sling occasionally and making a little sling for her as well so she can carry it.  It's a great size for her.  While the mouth isn't really open for feeding, the lips are parted enough that she can sort of pretend to bottle feed it.  It's not super soft plastic and so the legs and arms are pretty stiff and solid.  The eyes remain open, which is kind of a bummer.  My daughter is not big into dolls, so I just try to mention it now and then and get her to rock it or feed it.  I'm really not a fan of the smell.  I think it's too strong.  I like that they used phalate-free plastic, but I'm still not sure I want it sharing my daughter's bath because of all the fragrance they use.  It's a weird vanilla smell. I did my research though and pretty much all these types of newborn dolls have this baked-in smell (the nice ones that is).  I'm sure you can get one from a toy store that is cheap and scentless, but I really wanted the safer plastic (not that any plastic is that great).  Miniland has a website and they have several more dolls of different sizes.  They have different ethnicities, which is great because I can get different ones as my daughter gets older- if she ends up liking dolls.  They are very well made and a nice quality.

Kate was smart, honest and down to earth, something I don't usually find in female characters. I loved Brody! He came across as quite vulnerable which I like in a male character. It made a change to see a male character like that. These two characters are great on their own but together they really smoulder. They show a united front and both speak their mind. The love scenes weren't particularly steamy, I prefer a bit more detail but I don't think that would have suited this book. The plot was good and very well written.

0,"While I still enjoyed aspects of this series, I found this book unnecessarily complex in its mythological meanderings. I am not exactly sure was Atticus did with Granuaile for 12 years, but that might have been more interesting than this book. Things progress on the Granuaile arena, at least.  I think the conversations with Oberon seemed to get a bit too much (too cute by half) and got in the way of the story. As other reviewers have noted, I have been bothered by the brevity of these books and it sure does seem that Hearnes is using mythological twaddle as filler for his recent books. I enjoyed the first few much more, perhaps because they were anchored more in the real world. In the last couple of books there is a magical deus ex machina to solve all the problems of the complicated mess Atticus seems to have made for himself. Not sure if I will continue to buy into this series."

They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation. After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in. He was almost helpful. He searched the database and found that there was a 'cancellation'; however, it was not for the type of room I had reserved. I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days. I was given a box with a bed in it. They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation. Unfortunately, I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked. I had no choice but to accept what they had offered. I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here.

0,"I really enjoyed the 1st book, THINGS UNSEEN. But, what the heck? The author veers from an interesting, dystopian world with strong characterization in the 1st book into heavy handed religion in the 2nd. C.J. Brightley is a good writer but rapidly lost me in long (LONG) biblical discussions. If you are up for it, maybe you will want to hang in there to the end of this story (I quit half way) and even onto the next. For me, this was a disappointment and I doubt I will be reading more of Brightley's work."
0,"My theory is fiction writers (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists.  Every psychiatrist I know has gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis.  Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies.  If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude.  Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption.  We are introduced to each character in terms of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional.  (What is Schickler's own personal flaw?  Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss).  Each of these flaws is at the core of Schickler's stories.  The stories focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex.  We eavesdrop on each characters fantasies and insecurities.  (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy).  One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women.  Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious.  The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practices that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's dates had better be suspicious of nice diners).  In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with names changed to protect the innocent.  It's a book about losers scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling women allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.  That man's name is David Schickler."

0,"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.  Please feel free to ask me any questions about this item, and I'll do my best to answer.

The last thing alternate captain, Ryder Carrigan, wants to do is participate in a bachelor auction.  However, when the two meet they might have more in common than they would have expected.  This contemporary sports romance is suitable for new adult and adult audiences.  I like Ryder.  He is serious about hockey to a fault.  I appreciate after Ryder was called out by one of his teammates, he realizes that he needs to achieve more balance in his life.  This is a valuable life lesson that can benefit everyone.  I felt bad that Jessica was blindsided at the auction, but I love that her friend bid on Ryder for her.  They have some obstacles to overcome that make the story interesting. The two have great chemistry and make an excellent couple.  At ninety-seven pages, this story is a fast and captivating read that I finished in one sitting.  I enjoyed the charity scene in the beginning and thought that was a clever way for the characters to get together.  Chasing the Prize is a fun story and entertaining read.

She is 2.5, so she have the motor ability and skill level to stay up on this step stool and help when we cook or do things in the kitchen. I also use this around the house as a regular step stool. We have a small kitchen, so I like that I can fold this and keep it out of the way. A large wooden learning tower would not work well for our space at all. This definitely wouldn't work with a younger baby as a learning tower. Use your judgment. You know your child and their ability to stand on a stool without falling.. if you decide to use this as a learning tower too."

I just wish it had a more stretchy feel. It's a nice looking shoe. It's not a bad shoe for wearing at the gym. I just wish I could have gotten a few sizes bigger. I wish I had purchased a size larger. I have a wide foot and this is what I wore. I'm 5'3"" and this is the right size for me. I would definitely buy another pair. I'm 5'4"" and it fits perfectly. I wear this shoe for daily wear and will be wearing it all year long. I'll probably wear it all summer long.

0,"This story, Unruly Hearts, really delivered the romance that I was looking for in spades. I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who stars in this story for much more than her beauty was perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man says he loves you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he says it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story was the strong female friendships that are too seldom found in literature. This story was well written and the story flowed well. The imagery was exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story was Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feelings for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four stars instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that makes you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one."

0,"The movie was just okay. We have all seen this script before in a thousand other movies. Although the movie's real life premise was indeed interesting, the script and directing was just unable to harness this dramatic and emotional narrative. Camera work was shaky to force tension; I hate it when novice directors do this -- it just makes viewers motion sick. Also, Ben is simply a terrible actor. He emotes nothing, and with a beard it's less than nothing. I almost felt as if there was a movie being filmed and he was silently photo-bombing every seen. They sold us this directorial masterpiece and we bought it. It just didn't even come close to a masterpiece and someone must have ""bought"" them the Oscar. Life of Pie should have been Best Picture; it out ranks this bar-none. Politically, I am convinced that this Oscar was bought -- this picture's fame was manufactured and purchased with Hollywood politics and a massive press push. Wait till it's at the dollar rental."

1,I bougth 5 of this and it's the best. I will keep this for the next couple of months. Great price and I will buy another one as soon as I find it. The only thing I wish I'd done is to change it from a regular litter box to a full sized box. It's a bit expensive and I'm not sure if it would work as well. I wish I would have gotten it a little bigger for my cat because he will eventually eat the entire box.I bought this for a friend who has a small dog who is about 6 months old.

1,"After waiting impatiently for months, I finally got the chance to read it.  The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the Third World War, when the British and French were fighting in a war against one another.  The two main characters, Maisie and Marguerite, are young and inexperienced soldiers who are sent to China in search of a place to live and to train for war.  They are assigned to a small town in the middle of nowhere, where the Germans have developed a reputation for being violent, and where the French have been particularly successful.  The village is ruled by a group of young French women who live in a small apartment, and the Germans are at the"

0,"Daisy's friend, Chloe, invited her to her book launch party. Since Chloe's book is based on Daisy of course she goes to the party. Too bad the party was a bust. There weren't many people attending but the ones that did go sure made it a memorable night.  Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses! When he was later found dead there were so many suspects it was going to take the police a long time to find the murderer. Daisy couldn't let her friend, Chloe, be declared guilty so she decided to find out who the real killer was. Detective Stern was handling the case but he wasn't happy about Daisy's interference in the investigation.  I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite. I thought it was slow starting with the first 20% or so giving information about Daisy that wasn't necessary. In general, this book wasn't as interesting as the others in this series.  Please note I received a complementary copy in exchange for an honest review."

0,"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.  Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .  Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.  Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers."

I also have a feeling that it is going to be a little hard to get into the book as it is written.

I wear it to keep my hands warm and warm with a good amount of circulation.  I also like that the ring is smaller than I expected.

0,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.  **UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**  This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.  Here are some professional reviews:  wccftech. com/review/sapphire-r9-fury-nitro-review/  pcworld. com/article/3037975/components-graphics/sapphire-nitro-r9-fury-graphics-card-review-fast-furious-and-ridiculously-quiet.html  kitguru. net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/sapphire-nitro-r9-fury-oc-4gb-review/  techpowerup. com/reviews/Sapphire/R9_Fury_Tri-X_OC/  hexus. net/tech/reviews/graphics/90086-sapphire-radeon-r9-fury-nitro/  hardwareasylum. com/reviews/video/sapphire_r9fury-nitro  eteknix. com/sapphire-nitro-oc-r9-fury-graphics-card-review/  **Remember to delete the space between the .com as Amazon does not allow direct links in reviews.  I hope this review helps - good luck!"

It is heavy but works, if I were lugging it around on my back I limit it to two rifles max,  but there is plenty of room.  No problems with quality, appears well made.  The hook & loop (velcro) straps in each rifle compartment are good and secure up to two rifles but recommend a gun sock on one or both as you cannot keep them from bumping without an additional two hook and loop straps which would require you to modify. Shipping was quick and as quoted, however the box it came in was huge; you could literally pack an adult in it, so you know your case will arrive undamaged. :) The three add on pouches are MOLLE so you can substitute for your surplus IFAK/canteen  or ammo pouches as you wish."

0,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.  That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.  EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".  EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here."

Especially if you use your phone for things like watching video, reading documents and such. The case is very protective at the corners which is where a phone gets most damage. The two features i love are the standing slot and the auto on. Whenever you open the case the screen automatically turns on. This feature doesnt waste any battery and it saves you if your power button is losing. you don't even have to latch it everytime, I only latch it when i put it in my pocket. Normally i just let the cover down until the latch is resting on the edge and it shuts the screen off. The inside is very soft and won't scratch the screen and the outside feels great. Nothing i can find wrong with it except i wish it covered the edges of the phone more like it does the corners."

0,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).  At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.  But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

The waitress even asked why we were eating so early. It was 6:30pm. Our room in the hotel felt cramped. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom had maintenance problems. The maid service and turndown out night was good. All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying."

There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel; staff is excellent, never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. A few things that could make this hotel even better... A hand shower in the bathroom. The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom, instead of the bathroom, when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. Free internet access in the lobby. I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD (for 15 minutes) to log-on and check-in with my airline (only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying?!?!?!?)"

0,"I love this for so many reasons!  I have to take my 16 lb. cat to the vet and I use this carrier.  You can roll it, and I did that once, but the sidewalk is so uneven and it was noisy so I didn't want to stress him out with the bouncing around. So now I carry it on my back like a backpack, it is real easy to get on and off, padded straps are comfortable. One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket. The screen on the top and sides gives the cat some air, and it can be covered if it rains. I think it is the perfect item."

I did get a free shipping coupon on this holster so if you are looking for a holster with a decent price then go ahead and order one of these. I will be happy to help you find a holster that is as good as this one. I have a Glock 17 and it fits well in my hand. I would suggest you buy one of these for the Glock 17 as it is well made and has a lot of room for my Glock 17. I will be buying another one for my Glock 17.

0,"Please be aware that this backpack is seriously tiny. It's maybe a foot tall (just slightly taller than my Galaxy 4 phone) and as wide as my phone. This is my mistake since I didn't look at the size when I ordered it.  But it was suprising to see the small amazon box and wonder how they shoved a backpack into it (they didn't...it's little).The comb and mirror included are also itty bitty, but I'm an adult so these are not meant for my giant grown up lady hands.  It's a cute bag, the graphics look crisp, and for the price it's a good deal.  *I bought it for my friend's daughter, who is five. I'll be giving it to her in a few days, and if she likes it/it fits I'll be satisfied  Update: The backpack does indeed fit her, however it's on the loosest setting. She's a skinny little five-year-old, but she's kind of tall. So...I guess take that information as you will. She did like it though, and thought it was cute. I didn't see her use any of the hair things, but she thought the bag was cute and was excited about the hair clips."

It had a very nice look and the metal was smooth and solid. I love that it was made in the USA. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.This is a great tool for a utility tool kit.  I have used it a lot in my tools kit.  It is fairly heavy for my purposes.  However, it is not as heavy as a regular utility tool and I am sure it will last a long time.

I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her. Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart, a relationship that ended in a disaster. The last thing she needs was to become star struck.  Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet. They had this crazy connection together, but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle, Greg can be pretty much fickle minded. He can be all in, and then all of a sudden, he was nowhere in sight. He can be interested now, and then appear disinterested the next time. He had some secrets of his own, that I wanted to know. I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV. But I was stuck with Cathy, and her thoughts weren't that bad. There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after  and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work  There were times when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg  just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal  they were a great bunch, and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls. Greg was hard to love, but you couldn't resist his charms, so please don't blame Cathy.  This is my first Sunday James read, and it was okay.

0,"In his later years, Welles often complained that he spent more time trying to find money to make films than he did actually making films. And seeing Welles still scrambling for cash in his last days as a commercial pitchman for such products as Dark Tower and Paul Masson Wines (""Where we will sell no wine before it's time""), you know he was right. This entertaining and exhaustive book by Simon Callow doesn't deal with most of his film career - only covering up to 1941. (We're still waiting on part two to cover the rest. Simon? Simon?). However, what it does do is clear up much of Welles' confusing past (he often told conflicting stories in interviews) and delve into the two main works that set Welles up for stardom...and the fall...in Hollywood - The War of the Worlds radio broadcast and Citizen Kane. And no wonder they were sharpening knives for the boy wonder when Welles publicly put down the Hollywood community, his Kane script bit the hand that feeds him by taking obvious shots at newspaper mogul Randolph Hearst and he was given the kind of directorial freedom veteran directors could only dream of. Some people may tire of reading about Welles' theatre days with Houseman, anxiously waiting to get to the meat of his film career. But to understand why Welles became a ""has-been"" at 26 and the long slide to come, this is required reading."

I originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days I decided I had had my share of the water tower. Simply put it offered no reasons to stay. The Hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress, but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed. The First night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd, I think for the weekend. The next night the food was only mediocre and the third when I orderd room service I had to call twice. Even if you don't care about the food I think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice.

0,I bought this unit for the bedroom. I was looking for something that would work with my Ipod. This one does as advertised but only using the original Ipod cord. I tried a USB extension and a 30 pin extension. Neither would work. In the end I used the 3.5mm connection. Other than this annoyance I like the unit. Good value for the price.

0,"I do not order articles of clothing unless I have tried them on in person. I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit. I decided to order this dress and crossed my fingers. I have never been more surprised at the fit!  I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It was packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress as a gift.  I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.  The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!  I am happy with the purchase so far but will update this review if there is an issue. I may only use this a couple hours on a date night so use is infrequent.  I am not connected in any way to this company but I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I use reviews myself when shopping online and I hope this is useful information for you. Don't hesitate to ask questions and I will update if there is a problem in the future.

This one is still available on Amazon.  I'm not a fan of USB 3.0, but it does work well with the standard USB 2.0 ports.  I am not sure if it will work with other USB 3.0 devices, but it works well for me.Works great with my ipad. I have a wired mouse, and am using this mouse with a Macbook Pro. I have to get the mouse to move on my desk to use the mouse. It is a bit noisy, and I had to turn the mouse off to get the mouse to move on my desk. I will update this review when I receive it.

0,"Was slated for two nights in Chicago, June 12 - 14, 2007. I could onyl get the Intercon for both nights. I booked a handicapped room since that was they had left. After reading other reviews of the property, I decided to move it from two nights to one, and stay the second night at the Hotel Monaco. Of course, upon check-in, I was given a suite. Nice room, great linens, clean bathroom, and very quiet. Parking is really high ($48). I understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated, but everything was clean and worked well. At ,ost, the rooms were a bit dark. I had a late night drink at the bar, which was reasonably priced. i did not eat there, but the menu seemed pretty good, albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected. In all, I thought the place was everything I needed, and was very happy with the room, the staff, the linens, and the housekeeping. Much better than others have indicated."

0,"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed. There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack. The story and performances bear up under repeated viewings.  Comedy fans will enjoy it again and again!"

I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. The decor is a lot of fun. We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. The front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier. For people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away. I definitely recommend this hotel!"

0,"I recently wrote a review on the Robert Leckie book, Helmet for my Pillow, which in my view, was a narrative of what he did in the war in the Pacific. On the other hand, E.B. Sledge in his book, With the Old Breed, wrote about what he witnessed in the war in the Pacific. For those readers who want to know about what the Marines had to deal with against the Japanese, read the latter. It is down right ""chilling"",  and at the same time, a very serious read about Marine combat in the Pacific theater."

0,The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.  Overall though it is a a very good machine though.
0,"King has a natural (maybe supernatural) talent of writing horror novels. Everyone knows that. What a lot of folks don't know is he is one of our generations greatest writers period taking genre out of the equation. I've never read a novel that jumps back and forth to two timelines that I've enjoyed...until now. King does it effortlessly and fluidly. Also the story itself is so absorbing I had a hard time putting this book down each night. Childhood and childhood fears are two things King does great with and this story is no exception. The young characters come to life instantly. Its easy to picture each one. With all that said, this is perhaps the scariest novel I've ever read. One novel comes to mind that trumps this one in the scare department and its not King. It was immensely spooky because it dealt with not only childhood fears, which we can all relate to, but an evil of magnitudal proportions. Yes, this book is long but every paragraph is needed to build this story. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy if you've never read this."

An unexpected event plays out, which requires a life-saving measure for his one and only daughter. I don't want to spoil the story by disclosing any more key plot details and the events that follow. Everyone must make difficult choices, but in this case some become important in the whole scheme of things. I liked the story without knowing more details on who the old man was or what his life was before. I took everything at face value in the story, and I enjoyed the read. It had the twinkling of the Twilight Zone blinking in the background, without more than just the tasks of good deeds and for all the right reasons. One must decide what is important in the full big picture. It turned out to be the most valuable for Jack and his wife"

Still it's a great gift for the football fan in your life. Available  for many teams."

0,"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.  This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.  The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.  For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire."

This unit is built well, very easy to assemble and set up. My existing confidante drain was routed through my crawl space about 30' gravity drain through a foundation vent draining right up against the foundation. Summer heat made for LOTS of water pooling. The hornets and bugs loved the fresh water! I have a utility sink right next to my a/c coil in the garage. I set this unit up right under the a/c coil drain pan, 3/4"" PVC pipe into pump container and routed the 3/8"" tube into mop sink. Plugged it in, poured water in from a cup to test. It fired right up and continued to work perfect. It's very quite and it comes with the check valve so water in the tube vertical doesn't drain back into the resivoir. Very happy with it!"

0,"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.  Well worth anyone's time."

Staff was very nice and professional. Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful. Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets. We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room. Good size room, with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed. Bathroom was somewhat small. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day. Did not eat at the restaurant Nix, but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar. Overheard comments saying the food was very good. Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow. Martinis run $9 and up. Very good drinks and they don't shy away from the liquor. Valet parking was $35 a day with in/out priviliges. Overall a great stay. Would definately stay at this hotel in the future."

0,"I was shocked and appaIlled at the terrible story of the the evil son of the equally evil Saddam . The movie is a glimpse into the life of a man whose complete lack of moral conscience and humanity allowed him to do anything he desired without fear of retribution. The double, however, is a man who is appalled at the atrocities he's forced to witness and takes a daring step to get some justice for the lives Saddam's son destroyed. If you were as unaware of this story as I was, it will enlighten and perhaps enrage you but you will not fail to be moved!"

It is one of those movies that will keep you watching. This is a great movie for the whole family. I have watched it twice and I can't wait to see the next one. I love the ending. I have watched it many times. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it.I watched this movie with my son, who is 6 months old.  I am a big fan of the movies, and I have watched them over and over.  I have watched them a few times, and he has been very impressed.  I will watch the movie again, and the movie will not be as good as the first one.  I don't know why the movie was released so late, and I don't think the movie is that good.  I just don't see any reason to re-watch it, so I would recommend it.  I was very excited when I saw it, and I have not seen it again since."

We haven't dropped it or done anything to it (even though I would expect a baby toy to be able to withstand drops). My toddler is sad that we won't let him play with it, but I've tried everything to make it work again and it won't. It has a lot of potential and some cool features, but if those features don't work, there's no point in having it. As far as I'm concerned it was a waste of money."

And even though there weren't as many sexual escapades in this story as in the others, it was nice to see Morgan connect with someone on a deeper level and figure out more about herself.

1,"I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.  I really enjoyed this book. It's not the best book I've read by far, but it was definitely worth the read.  This was a very short story about two people who are still in love. I love a fast paced story, and I love a story with a lot of emotion. This was a good book for a quick read, and it was nice to have an epilogue for the characters.I really enjoyed reading this book. It was really nice to read about a great guy. There were a few things that I felt that needed some work but overall it was a good read.

0,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.  It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.  However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.  On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.  So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed."

0,"It is difficult to find bulbs that look like the ones shown in the picture.  I have gotten gold bulbs that are called amber, even with GE numbers that formerly corresponded to imprints on bulbs that look like the dark amber ones.  I have also searched imprinted dark anber bulb GE parts numbers and found a florescent bulb.  These bulbs are very price, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.  One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.  At least this seller could guarantee they were dark amber."
0,"I use these in my closet to hang my clothes and jacket.  They work well and hold well.  The forever classic large metal hook fit and finish is excellent.  They look more expensive than they are.  The hook itself is a bit shallower than I would prefer, but they work well.  I did not want the more pointier ones."
1,"This hotel is in a great city with great personnel working there. The rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel. The services are abundant, leaving no room to complain. With their fine diners, you cannot go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing. With this hotel, it is truly an all-in-one hotel. There are meeting rooms and business centers, leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay. In addition, the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress. The views from the rooms are breathtaking. I would definitely recommend staying there!"

1,"I'm really impressed and I'm sure the quality is good too.  My only complaint is the extra size so I had to replace it.  My dog is a bully who likes to get down on his own and get up on his own.  This one is a little too small for him.  I ended up going with the larger size.  If you have a bully who will get down on his own, this is a good choice.  I will buy another one for my other dogs."
0,"Three and a half stars  If you enjoyed The Reader then you'll enjoy The Speaker which has the same strengths as the first book. You know want to expect with the addition of some new characters and we get deeper into The Guard. Some of The Book passages are more impactful as they help unravel the past and what the future will be.  With so many points of view and several timelines, this is a series which takes its time so read this if you want a fantasy that has a more luxurious pace. I still find some do the characters more compelling than others and the story wanders a bit, but the story is sharpening up as we head into the next book in the series."

1,This unit is actually working better than the one we had before it. The dimensions are just right. The blades are nice and thick and the blades are not so thin as some of the blades we have been using. The blades are very thin and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with a heavy weight. The blades do not have a strong enough grip to make a great counterweight. I am not sure if this is a good design or if it is just a matter of how the blades are spaced. We have been using the blade for a while now and it is still holding up well. We have not had any problems with the blades sticking to the counter and we have not had any issues with the blades sticking to the counter.

I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot.

0,"This started out in such a dark way, I thought I would hate it. In fact, this is a great story with a surprising twist."
0,"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.  Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...  I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size..."
0,"I chose the book because I loved others books written by Howatch, but this one unfortunately disapointed me a lot."
0,"I have mixed feelings about this book, the things that I liked were also the things that I didn't. Maddie for example, was this sweet girl-woman and throughout the book, it is revealed how much a victim this young girl really was. At the same time, I thought that is exactly what makes her such a complex character to read about. If this was reality, then I would not feel this way, because I think that her overcoming the abuse was so much a part of the story, it would be the furthest thing from entertaining for me to read. For this reason and a few others, one being the connection between Caden and Maddie that was choppy at times, I don't know if I would ever want to read this book again. There is definitely a difference  between the last two books by SM and the earlier ones in this series, one of the problems being that there have been huge breaks between books, and while I want to read a nicely finished book, this just caused me to forget and not care anymore. I gave the book 4 stars because when Maddie and Caden were at odds with one another, it was written such that I really felt what they were struggling with and for that the author deserves credit. When they were reconciling, Caden showed absolutely the right amount of gentleness I wanted him too. Honestly,  the part where the conflict with his own family was not explained enough, I was  able to take at face value as I would not want to read pages and pages about the extremely violent circumstances of those times, a couple of sentences thrown in here and there were quite enough for me. All in all, a good addition to this series, but not a hot romance as I would like to have read from  SM."
1,Best purchase I've made this year!
1,I bought these for my dog. She loves them. She also loves the smell of the other two. The smell of the other two is much better. I would definitely recommend these.

0,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.  Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!"

0,"Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago, The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel 'needs updating,' but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.) There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars, that the Fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. See my profile for better ideas. Niftyc"

It tweaked my interest from the first page, and it did not diminish throughout the whole book. I have suggested this book to several people, and I know of at least one who is reading it, and also having a difficult time putting it down. I am not necessarily a fan of Mike Tyson, but it does show how easy it is to be caught up in the media frenzy and be used by those one should be able to trust.  Mike listened to the wrong people too many times."

1,"Just as Karloff, Lugosi and Rosario Dawson are the most talented in the world, the other three are the worst.  The movie is a mess, the acting is terrible, and the movie is a sad little movie.  I would have liked to have seen more of the series.  I don't think I would have gotten it.  I hope they make a sequel.  I wish I would have known more about the show and the characters.  It's very sad.I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch this movie on TV, and I was a little confused by it.  I remember watching it with my friends and my grandkids.  I had never seen this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was a little worried that they would find out the truth behind it, but I was a little disappointed.  I don't know why the people who did this didn't get this movie, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be so funny.  I guess it was supposed to be funny, but I guess it was more like ""One More Time"" and that would have made it more interesting.  I guess it was just a little too far fetched, but it was worth watching.  I think it was really good.  I think that people who are not interested in the movie should watch the movie and not buy it.  The movie is pretty good, but I would have thought that this movie would have been better if it was a little more complicated."

Deborah is a beautiful woman, and she's a bit secretive. Moira is still waiting for Deborah to come to Eidolon, and when she does, she's kidnapped by a group of girls. Deborah is a very special person, and she's on a quest to find Moira and her friends. She's also on a quest to find a man who is also a girl. Deborah is a hero to Moira, and she's willing to face the truth of her past.  While I found this book to be a bit of a slow read, I didn't mind much at all.

0,"I was looking for a nice casual dress that I could wear for the spring and summer and luckily the opportunity came along to try this one. I likes it so much that I immediately ordered another in red and I might even get another color. The dress fits me perfectly. I ordered mine in 3X. When I buy dresses similar to this style from Lane Bryant. I normally get the 18/20 size. The size chart of this dress list the 3X as suitable for 22W/24W. I guessed that the dress might run small... and in my case. I guessed right. I wanted some brighter colors and the teal is really pretty and the red is a very bright and vibrant. I like how light weight it is. It's very thin and that will keep me nice and cool especially in the summer heat. It's machine washable so I don't have to worry about a dry cleaning bill. You can add a scarf or nice jacket to jazz it up for the fall you could even add leggings and/or a long sleeved shirt underneath for wearing it in cooler weather. The only drawback is that the V-Neck plunges a bit too much, so I'll have to always wear a tank top underneath to keep my bra from showing. It's not too long either. It falls right above the top of my feet, so I can wear it with sandals or heels. I'm extremely happy with this garment and highly recommend it.  THE TEAL COLOR: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  My opinions are based on my own personal experience with this product. No monitory compensation was received and I was not required to write a positive review. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsement and Testimonials in Advertising.  THE RED COLOR: Paid full price.

0,"Would be a 5 but unlike headlights that use batteries which gradually grow dimmer, when this needs to be charged, it literally shuts down.  So if you're out in the woods on a dark night, you have nothing.  Could be scary and even dangerous.  One note that can be either positive or negative is that the beam is pretty focused, more of a spot than a flood, so you can see far in advance.  I like it, so a positive for me.  Living in AK, I never go anywhere in the winter without a headlight.  Most of the time I only use the low beam, which is plenty to find my way around.  Also love the red light, which is a great one for going outside, has enough light to see where you are going, and still be able to see the stars or the Northern Lights without your eyes having to readjust."

The end, while not completely surprising, was still good enough to make me feel like I had a read a good book when I was finished. In fact, I was sad enough leaving the character of Paul Brenner that I looked up to see if DeMille had written another book starring him.

0,"Having watched RAI's Montalbano television series (with Luca Zingaretti's outstanding performances as the eccentric inspector), I was expecting to find the novels familiar and boring. Not at all, not in the least. The TV series excel in giving us the visual feel of the exteriors: the superb cast of delightful characters; and the beauty of Camilleri's fictional town of ""Vigta"" in the fictional district of ""Montelusa"" (actually the Sicilian city of Ragusa, Italy, and surrounding towns). The novels give us what TV cannot, the interiors, the feelings and cogitations of the uniquely unpredictable Montalbano and the reactions of those around him. As Montalbano's faithful (and unusually astute) detective, Fazio, says to himself in ""The Snack Thief,"" his boss didn't become insane, he was insane from birth. The novels reinforce TV's visual charm and delicious performances with the ""insides"" of the plots, people, and places. In many ways, ""Voice of the Violin"" is the most noir of the series--plot and counter-plot turn the unraveling into a delicious concerto of criminality. One can hear the gears and the arpeggios whirling about in Salvo brain. Camilleri's novels are such a delight to read, I imagine Montalbano's police force colleagues, friends and lovers, even his opponents (criminal and bureaucratic), who lived the plots with him, would enjoy these books. And Montalbano? He'd read the novels and then ask Camilleri, half-serious, half-mocking, ""So, why are you always busting my balls?"""

The book provides comprehensive, easy to read information on the 10 most beneficial supplements for men and how they can help to get that sexy physique that you desire. What I like most about the book is that it gives a complete overview of the supplements their benefit, uses and precautions. Reading this book will help any man on the quest for a safe and healthy way to build lean muscles by complementing their diet with supplements to achieve their goals. The author goes as far as to telling you which workout programs goes best with the supplements, for example creatine is good for short repetitive workouts as opposed to aerobics. Well written facts on supplements that I know will benefit anyone who wants to increase their knowledge as well as use supplements in a safe and effective way."

Too bad they couldn't make this ball in the typical orange rubber so that it wouldn't get so hot in the heat.  Other than the color and how hot it gets in the sun it is a very good basketball."

As a casual fan, I haven't really been bothered by the edits or changes. Season 1-3 seem to be mostly intact. Seasons 4 and 5 are where I noticed some differences. If you're a purist or die-hard fan, I understand why you wouldn't purchase this set though. For the casual fan, I think it's well worth the price. The transfer to DVD looks good. The set also comes with some nice extra features such as commentary from Gary Marshall, interviews, and more. The only other negative besides the edits is that the packaging is quite poor. The plastic case is thin and flimsy. The disks are easily dislodged. All around, I give this set 4 Stars. Casual fans will really enjoy it, but purists might be disappointed."

0,"This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. However, when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. Wireless internet is available, but that's an additional fee. Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free! Also, the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. Wow, I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. When I used the coffee supplies in the room, they were not replenished. I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. No kidding, nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar! Glad I wasn't in a big hurry. I'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I'm in Chicago!"

The location is wonderful,it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier, which was a great place to show the children on our vacation. We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car,and the valet was very nice and helpful. I also take my work with me everywhere I go,So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus. They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing. This place is great for the price, due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is. This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay."

The Alpha video print is IS A PRESSED PRINT AND THE QUALITY IS PRETTY GOOD for what they have put out in the past.  The best print of this film I have seen is on ""The Great American Western"" series from Platinum. There are several other films on the same disc which are't  of the best quality, but this one is!

0,"Assembling the unit takes about 5 minutes.  You will need one 7/16"" wrench (or ratchet or crescent wrench or 11 mm wrench) to tighten the nylock nuts that hold everything together.  As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.  My gutter-cleaning problems are now over.  Side note:  I agree with another reviewer that the sheet-metal edges are very sharp and could definitely use a little sanding."

0,"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).  Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...  OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.  I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money."

0,"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing....."

0,"This is not a 'vine review.' Dollar for dollar I do not know of a higher value than this line of meters. If you want a better one but still high value you can look for some of the Uni-t brand meters for ~$20. One caveat with these, what I call ""Harbor Freight"" meters, is that half of the meter leads are trash. You MUST test the leads. I run 1A through the lead and test the voltage across it with a known good meter. If a lead measures more than .2V at 1A it is unusable. I have seen these leads test as high as .6V at 1A. That is .6 ohm. Many of your readings will be meaningless with leads with that kind of resistance. As for the units themselves, they work quite well. I've only had one fail. The display was quite jumpy for some time. Then the readings started to drift very high before the display just went blank. I avoided these cheap meters for years because I did not think I could get a respectable product for this price, but now this is my go-to meter for when I might leave it behind or lend it out and not get it back. When in doubt go for something with better leads to start with such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uni-T-UT30D-Pocket-size-Digital-Multimeter-with-Square-Wave-Generator-50Hz-Sinometer-OEM/dp/B005TLXNPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uni-T UT30D Pocket-size Digital Multimeter with Square Wave Generator (50Hz),Sinometer OEM</a>"

Unfortunately Fisher Price decided to make the war pieces so large that they won't even kind of fit into an adult ear, much less a 3 year olds.

It's very difficult to fit everything inside (especially that rigid stethoscope), and it really doesn't stay closed so everything just falls out.

When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books."

0,"I've had them all. Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.  Mine has held up for the last 3 years and the handle, bits show minimal wear. They see moderate to heavy use (no abuse) every day."

The last film is the last of the four in the series, and it's the last of the four in the series.  The only change is the addition of a new character, a man who lives in the past and is now a new person.  The movie opens with the main character, a man who is involved with the death of a woman, but he does not get any action, only just a brief moment of action."

0,"Rampage rocked in the movie, even though ( spoiler alert...) Bumblebee knocked his socks off, hes the first ever 4 legged transformer, and has a unique set of weapons. my disappointments were the packaging details and paint were way better than the real thing, the pistons don't actually move on their own, like other ""mech alive"" doodads, and they don't stay in place all that well, the elbows don't bend in enough directions, which is understandable because of the  limitations with where they end up in vehicle mode,  his eyes don't glow, but other than all that negativity I'm glad i paid 2-day shipping to get him. Although difficult i still recreate the movies battle scenes with him... don't ask my age."
1,"Although his alt-mode is quite low, the fact that it is a lot of fun for him and he is so close to the front of his seat is a good sign. The only thing that I do think is a bit off is the fact that the controls are rather simple. The buttons are always a bit difficult to control and it's difficult to learn the names of the animals you are trying to kill. This is not a big deal for us, but it is annoying for him. Overall, I think this is a very good game, and I'm not sure that it is worth the money.  If you like that game, buy it.Love it!  We love it!  Great price and shipping!My daughter loves this toy!

0,"This a brilliant, fun, thought provoking, wonderful book by a mistress of her craft.  I do not know if it is the best detective novel of all time, but it is up there. I would say it was one of the best novels I ever read - period. I read it many years ago, decades, in fact. I could do no more than give a general synopsis, though usually I don't bother when others have anyway. But, if you put a copy in my hand today, I would read it again. The fact that she was not aware of certain evidence or relied on evidence that we would now perhaps think not so persuasive is irrelevant. Most detective novels are far more unrealistic than this one, which is at least steeped in history. I read some of the negative comments, as I almost always do when I loved a book. Generally speaking, it gives the impression that some people who are uninterested or uninformed by history were bored by the book. But, note that over 80% of reviewers gave it 4 or more stars and over 90% 3 or more. That's pretty good. This is not a Reacher novel (and I like them) and the protagonist is bedridden, so don't expect action. It is a mental adventure and she succeeded wildly."

1,"The International Chicago Magnificent Mile is shrouded in glamour, but underneath the facade fades away. The 'classical architectural landmark' should be translated to 'old and boring. I found this hotel via Google and have regretted it ever since. Room size was small and unaccommodating, and that was one of the newer rooms! Everything was free except for the gym (why that wouldn't be free with the price I paid I don't know). This hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get, and I would not recommend staying there."

0,"Aurora Rose Reynolds took possessive to a whole new level with Justified and I LOVED every single second of it. Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.  Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!  I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.  My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.  I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too!  *ARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review."

She did not have an infection.  We discovered it was not all that uncommon for female dogs to develp some urinary tract and bladder weaknesses after they are spayed.  We noticed a change in her in about three weeks.  She stopped having accidents and leaks.  She loves to chew the tablets.  They are liver flavored so she thinks they are a treat. When she ran out of them for a few weeks, we noticed she started to have some leakage problems again, so we put her back on the product and so far no problems.  We saw no side effects either."

If we ever decide to get a real (thicker) tree it'll work out better. It isn't the best tree skirt but it isn't the worst. The characters are cute. The material is a heavier felt.

This isn't going to be advertised on the cover of Martha Stewart living's tree skirt of the season, but if you just need something cheap quick this should work fine."

I have had it out in the yard with our bucket for a while and have not had issues with it rusting or anything because it is almost all plastic. I wish that they also sold a bucket or something, but a nice 5 gallon bucket with a garbage bad in it works fine. That way you can dump the load while you walk around instead of having to walk all the way to the trash.

One minor nitpick is that the GN swords don't hold up nicely when placed in the hands, they are loose and will fall out when trying to pose this figure. Other than that, it's a really awesome figure, easy to put together, and overall the product is great. If you love and are a hardcore fan of Gundam, get this and add it to your collection. Highly recommend it."

I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.  'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.  Overall, good product."

The software is creating some problems for the power users but I don't think most people will notice a problem.

0,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better."
0,"I just left the Conrad Chicago and have nothing but good things to say. We used Hilton points to stay there but paid $35/night to upgrade to a junior suite. We were in room 1519. I would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on Michigan Ave. Our room was very modern with 2 large HD/flat panel tv and Bose 3 speaker sound system. 4 big windows that actually open. The bed lineds were very nice, the towels were OK. The room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub. Marble everywhere. Robes, slippers, etc. The work out room was good with different machines and some free weights. There are clean towels in the workout room too. We never ate in the hotel so I can't comment on the food or the prices. There is a Starbucks across the street (Michigan) and an Espresso bar attached to the Nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel. It was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel. The location of the hotel could not be better. We were walking distance to everything. Every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles. Over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain."

0,"I love the idea of the automatic litter box but mine broke after only a few months. Now the light just blinks and I have to push it in order for it to rake the litter. The whole point of it was to make my cat's lives better when I'm not around but now that's not happening. I also scoop out what does get raked into the holding box every couple days since there is a smell. The litter itself is ok. It doesn't really absorb the cat urine so I try to scoop that out when I clean their box. I may try filling the cartridge with a different litter next time to see if that will work. I think clumping litter would be better anyway since it would get raked into the box and be easier to get rid of the smell."

0,"I haven't read the previous two books in this series but I was able to follow this story with no problems and fall in love with the Hurley family. I really loved this book. Theres something incredible appealing about second chances. I can honestly say its hard for me to review this book, because I can relate to part of it. My parents got divorced when I was 6, they never got back together because my mom moved on and thats totally ok because they were kind of awful together. I can understand that sometimes great things happen to people at the wrong moments, sometimes were just not ready to appreciate it, to cherish it. That was my dads case and thats probably why I understand all the background of this book and why I was moved by it. Lauren Dane wrote a real touching story. I really loved Kelly, her relationship with her daughters and I liked that Vaughan was determined to do everything to get his family back. The only but here is that, from my point of view, Kelly fell into the relationship a little fast even though she made him work to prove that he changed. I will probably go back to read the first two books in this series and I would love to read a book about Kellys best friend, Stacey! I received a copy of this book for free, via NetGalley."

0,"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?  As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl [."

0,"I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.  The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.  No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.  UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea."

It was like a well written story.  I liked the fact that the author used a lot of words and it made the story more realistic. I think that the author would have used some of the things that could have been used for a different story.  I liked the fact that the author kept the main character's name and family name.

0,"Review of Secondhand Lions Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017  Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good."

0,"We have been looking FOREVER it feels like for a good, durable outdoor table that will store away. It is great for kids. DEFINITELY will not hold the weight of an adult though, which was a little disappointing... we had our sons birthday party and he wanted me to sit with him and it about broke before I even put all my weight on it and I'm only 130. I don't think it would honestly hold more than 4 kids unless some sat on the joints. It held fine when my son (40lbs) sat on one bench but when his friend sat next to him (30 lbs) it began to creak and bend. The table top itself is a lot more sturdy. Our dog (60lbs) likes to lay on the table with our puppy (50lbs) and no bending or anything. Overall good buy, a little bit of a pain to put together but worth it for the safety factor."

0,"Although these can hardly be called ""shorties"" -- they hit mid-thigh -- they are definitely comfortable ""smoothers.""  I can wear mine all day, and I only occasionally remember that I'm wearing them.  A medium fits a pants size 8-10.  I was a little surprised to see how sheer these are, without any seams at the bottom.  But the lack of hem is a great idea since no one can see the line where the shapewear ends.  (If you buy too small, you might see a difference between the compressed area and your thigh.)  Because they are so sheer, the amount of control is light, but the smoothing factor is strong.  Especially under tight or stretchy pants, these smooth out bumps nicely.  Yeah, they don't work miracles, but they can make your body look sleeker than it is.  I'm always concerned that shapewear, particularly the kind that targets thighs, will ride up.  On a full, 16-hour day of wearing the shorty shapewear,  this might happen two or three times at most, and it's never so bad that it's uncomfortable or visible.  I never feel the pinch at my waist that I had with another brand that I tried.  Perhaps because these offer moderate control -- as opposed to full-on squeezing -- they are the most comfortable shapewear I've worn.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

0,"These fit well. They tuck well. They definitely make hot weather easier to manage if you wear multiple layers. My two complaints: 1) The collar is sized in a manner that often you are left feeling the tag of your outer shirt on your neck, which can be annoying, especially if you are wearing sunscreen. Sometimes this collar will ""roll up"" too. I assume this is from the type of material used. 2) Due to the material of the shirt, your outer shirt tends to come untucked, ballooning much sooner into your work day. This, again, is likely due to the material of the shirt, as there is minimal friction between the undershirt and the outer shirt. This untucking is exacerbated if your outer shirt happens to be moisture wicking (low friction at the underside, usually). While I really do appreciate what these shirts do, I cannot imagine spending the same amount of money on another two. If the price was a bit less, then yes. However, for the money, there are a plethora of other brands that have extremely similar materials (literally two sides of the same coin at this juncture of clothing technology), that likely perform just as well. Since it is an undershirt, how much does brand really matter? IF brand does matter to you, then know these do what they advertise, but come with a few caveats."

0,"I have had 3 pairs of this headset. I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge."

0,"I recently loaned this dvd to a young queer who told me they had no idea that homosexuality was illegal in the United States until 1969. This young person is 22 years old.  Needless to say, the documentation of queer history is sorely lacking. Fortunately the American Experience, which always delivers perfect, entertaining yet respectable productions of historical American time capsules, has approached this subject/story of when gay men and women in America stood up to the police (and the mafia) and said ""No more"".  This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969.  You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story.  You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trials suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexuals in human history, you'll agree that the methodic efforts to obliterate this sector of society has been continuous and is still alive today.  This documentary belongs in every library interested in human history. Not just just gay history."

0,"The essence of a good novel is its ability to whisk you away to a place where you would not normally go. Linda Collison does such a thing wonderfully in her debut novel, Star-Crossed. Patricia Kelley sets out in 1760 from her paupered but privileged place in English society to claim her dead father's only estate asset, a sugar plantation in Barbados. Stowing away on a boat, she is first moonstruck by a bosun's mate, Brian Dalton, but then faces the dilemma of choosing Dalton's love or marriage's security with a more sensible choice to marry the ship's doctor, MacPherson. The entire story swings many times like a pendulum between this two contrary choices.  Along the cruise, readers are exposed to life on several English navy ships are Patricia travels with Dalton and/or MacPherson to various Caribbean locales in changing circumstances. As she literally rides the staterooms by day and the yardarms by night, her life takes equally polar changes that can be sensually experienced by those wishing to join her on the page. Her final destination satisfies both her heart and her head.  A thoroughly enjoyable story."

The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table (!) and canted forward. Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer. Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos, I have to assume this design flaw with the couch/futon runs throughout the property. Bed was fine and bath was fine but I can't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well. The couch/futon seating is the worst I've encountered in a modern hotel."

I see that it comes with nice online components and is fairly modern but as a student reading it for a self-propelled style course that I took for fun I found that many of the test questions weren't even in this material and I could read it and not know about more than half of what I read. I did appreciate details that weren't in the textbooks of the 1990's like union strikes and monopoly dealings and a greater emphasis on race relations in mining and Native American dealings (more history being revealed) but over all I found the book a bit boring and strangely organized and lacking in depth.-- It jumps too fast post 1900 onward.--It seems to be cramming more history into the same length of textbook these days is their solution to the problem of more and more history being revealed, but I found it more of a problem. 2.5 stars."

The characters are well-thought out and realistic and the author gives the reader a good sense of the time period. Ben Woodard is an excellent writer who knows how to plot and plan a great adventure story."

I'm sure other more expensive knives are better but for someone that isn't hardcore, this is a perfect knife (thus far), It's sharp, opens smoothly, feels solid, and not expensive.

0,"This cookie sheet is a thin silicone membrane with a silicone covered metal frame and handles that is oven safe to 400 The baking surface dimension is not a perfect rectangle; the width of the edges measure 10 1/2 wide, the center 11. I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve. When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing. Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.  I will use it more as specialty equipment for baking something very sticky like Florentines but continue to use my traditional cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper for most of my baking."

0,"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia and Matt Damon head a super-cast of stars (among others, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle -both of them, second timers with director Steven Soderbergh from Erin Brokovich and Traffic, respectively) in a movie about... yes, the traditional robbery theme! Seen it before? Yep! Clooney (Danny Ocean), yet in another ex-convict role (remember ""O, Brother...""?), leads a gang of eleven experts to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Sounds like a familiar plot? Perhaps, but Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull off a movie that's very entertaining. Not that it's in any way related to the plot of the 1992 movie, but it reminded me of the movie ""Sneakers"" where Robert Redford gathered a group of experts as well... That's where the similarities stop. Then it is very much like Traffic, in its overall feel, music, and even part of the concept. 'Nuf said! Check it out!

But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it. I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.  With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries. With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production) With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)  Pros: - PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these) - SIZE (fits in any bag) - WEIGHT -- Light weight - AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus - STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens) - COLOR -- Great color - SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!! - Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!  Cons - BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together) - STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens) - BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery) - RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.

The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.  Installation was quick and easy.  The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.

0,"Whew, this book may be one of the most intense love stories that I have ever read. I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.  After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.  Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship. Chloe's best friend is a real hoot and I would have liked to learn more about her character.  Scorching sex scenes are an integral part of this book and Ms. Wolff does an excellent job of creating passion.

1,"Jamie and Gretchen were best friends.  Their relationship is developing and growing, and Gretchen has to find a way to keep Gretchen away from him.  This is a great book to read and look at in a few years.  If you like to read about how relationships with people like your family have changed, this book is a great way to do that.I love this series.  This book is a must read for any fan of all things New England.  A must read for anyone who loves the series.  I love the characters.  They are so realistic and believable.  They are definitely a must read for any fan of the series.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about New England and who loves to read about the characters.This is a good book, but I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I really enjoyed the story line and was not sure if I would like it or not.  I am not sure if this is the best or the worst book I have read.  The characters were interesting but I felt like they were very different from the main characters"

0,"I'm a huge fan of the Saucony Jazz sneaker. They're not the most durable, nor are they particularly good for exercise or whatever. They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will ever really go out of style.  The best part is that they're priced in such a way that I don't feel terrible about replacing them once a year. I blow through a pair of these in about a year, but Amazon usually has one or more colors of them available for a really reasonable price point. This time I went with an all-black style, but I also have some green ones. It's a lot like wearing the converse all stars, but you get a lot more support for your foot. You can buy a bunch of these in different colors, if you want to have fashionable colorful sneakers but you don't want to develop foot and back pain.  And let's face it, by the way -- if you're walking around all the time, doing errands and exercise, and all that sort of thing, most sneakers are going to wear out pretty quickly. At least these are lightweight, comfortable, and fashionable -- and they don't break the bank!"

Five stars just for the acting by the two leads: Zach Braff puts in an incredible and unexpected performance - we should see more from him.  Strong, solid, believable performance by Isabelle Blais playing a difficult role.  If you like indie films, give this one a shot."

I'm not sure if it's the bag itself or the product itself, but the cats were pretty much taking it away when I opened it.I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the best price. I have a German Shepherd and I had to buy a second bag so I could use it. It does hold up well, but the metal bars on the sides are very thin. The material is very strong and I'd be happy with it if it were thinner. I just wish the bars were more sturdy.I like that the water is not too acidic. It helps keep the water fresh"

I read many books about this topic and still this book has thought me so many new things that are helpful for me as a writer. I will recommend this book to all my fellow writers. Its a real treasure.
1,"Wolfe is best known as a writer and an academic. He is a professor of law and has published a number of books about the subject. He is the author of the book ""The Law of Economics"" and the book ""The Law of Economics"" is his best known work. He is also a professor at the University of Chicago, where he has published a number of books about the subject. He has also published numerous articles on economics and on economics as well as on economics as a matter of fact. He is a very good writer, and he is one of the best economists in the world. In short, this book is a good read. It is a good book, but I would recommend it to anyone who has never been in the real world. I would recommend it to anyone who has been in the real world, even if it is a somewhat ""real"" world. I really enjoyed the book. I didn't get a good read on the history of the western hemisphere and the role that the US played in the founding of the United States. The book was a little slow for me. I liked it a lot. But I loved it a lot."

0,"Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier works.  Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warriors from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  ""gwali.""  The princes of the realm are handsome and heroic, their  princesses beautiful and spirited.  The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a storyline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight or substance to the  tales, and harbor some doubts that the ""Riftwar Saga"" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests. Nonetheless I  will admit that so far Feist's stories do offer facile moments of unadorned  diversion and amusement."

0,"I really think apple has missed the mark advertising the iPod touch mainly as a game machine. The apps are extraordinarily useful. I'm very glad I decided ( at the last minute ) to get the 32 gb model. I'm not using the iPod portion that much --some music and podcasts, but the add on apps have been very VERY useful. The screen is gorgeous , the keypad easy to use. If I had to quibble I'd say my biggest gripe is that flash and shockwave don't work yet. I know why apple has done that, but it's inconvenient. Youtube videos are fine. Battery life okay if you aren't on the internet the whole time -- i am, so it gets about five or six hours. Wifi reception has been excellent. Built in speaker is tinny and not loud enough, but i rarely use it so i didn't take off for that. There's an app to share files with your computer wirelessly, which is handy for transferring  stuff via webdav connection to read later when you have no connection. Another app lets you capture articles from news and web sources to revisit later. There's even an app to make voip calls from the touch. (you have to add earphones with a mic -- picked up a pair on amazon for $7 and now make occasional calls via Internet. there have been a few times that I REALLY missed not being able to connect when away from wifi, but I do not miss the 2 yr contract to at&t. if you have wireless handy and don't need a full service phone contract this is the answer."

I just wish there was a way to remove the metal covering. I will buy another one. I got this for my son's old house. He loved it and it was great!

I also like the fact that the sides are made of a metal material and not plastic. I would recommend them for anyone with an occasional rustic kitchen. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it works!  I used it to make a batch of a New England coffee for my son to make into a couple of quickies. He is very pleased with the design and the quality. I am happy with it and will buy it again. This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth it to keep it at a room temperature, but I have it on my mattress with no problems. I wish it had a small, low profile cover that was just right for my husband to put on his pillow for a few minutes of sleep."

0,"Wow!  Sometimes a great book comes along that grabs you and you can't stop thinking about it.  The his is one of those books.  Give yourseld time so you don't have to put it down. Violet is recuperating from a serious accident that killed her fianc and left her badly scarred.  Her favorite pastime is ogling her sexy and very hot neighbor, as he repairs his roof.  When he falls from the roof, Violet rushes over, only to find him sprawled on a trampoline.  Making sure he's fine, he admits that he knew that she had been watching him, and wanted to meet her, figuring this was the only way it was going to happen.  For the first time Violet wants to let loose, to be reckless, something she's never had the courage to do, as the future CEO of Walker Construction.  She wants Noah, that is no secret, but she can't let him see her scars, so they embark in a just sex relationship.  How can she do this without baring herself. When Noah sees his sexy neighbor watching him, he pretends to fall off the roof, hoping that she'll come over, so he can finally meet her.  Noah knows that Violet is hiding something since she only wants them to use their first names, and why is she always wearing scarfs when it's not even cold out.  As they get to know each other, they both start having feelings for each other.  However, how can they go forth when she doesn't trust him enough to reveal herself and her secrets. This wonderful story is about hope, love and realizing that when you find true love, nothing can stand in the way.  I received this as an ARC from the author for an honest review and this is as honest as it gets."

I have read all of her Novels and this one is superb.  She has such  talent, and all of her novels flow with ease.  There is natural character development, perfect story progression, and she delicately weaves the dark parts of the characters past with the light.  Her attention to detail is exquisite and not forced. She NEVER overwhelms you with so much information about the characters, that it takes from the story because you can't keep up.  She is such a gifted author, and once you read Nate and Liv's story you will see what I mean. You must read this book!"

He used to eat a very expensive cat food and he threw that up too (though not as often). I was able to cancel his vet appointment for now and save another $200+ vet bill.

0,"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.  My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.  Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set."

0,"I was gifted an ARC of this boxset from Tasha Black, also ARC of ""An Impossible Gift"" from Cristina Rayne, as well as an ARC of ""Wish upon a star"" from Elsa Jade, in exchange for an honest review.  I'm loving this boxset so far, it has some authors I already follow & some new authors being introduced to me. Once I have read a book within, I'll add my reveiw for it.  The Clockwork Dragon by Tasha Black.... I FLOVE Tasha's ""Curse of the Alpha"" & ""Fate of the Alpha"" series & to learn that 'The Clockwork Dragon' is set at Tarker's Hollow.... made me do the happy dance. I was instantly sucked back into the lives of the citizens of Tarkers Hollow & I LOVED it!! Although it's centered around the Magical side of the community of Tarker's Hollow & not the wolves, you still get a scense of being there again. I was LOST in this, the story was rivetting.  An Impossible Gift by Cristina Rayne.... Oh My Goodness! That was short, fast paced & downright AWESOME! This is the first time I've read about Vamps from Cristina, usually it's shifters, but damn this story was good. Fast paced, full of action, loads of background story (you need this, believe me), a hot sexy Vamp who doesn't sparkle, all wrapped into a story about healing.  Wish upon a Star by Elsa Jade.... I am currently HOOKED on Elsa's ""Wolves of Angels Rest"" series, the minute one arrives on my kindle app, I'm devouring it quickly. 'Wish upon a Star' is a part of this series & what a Christmas story it was. It had me gripped from the very start, til the end... & just like the rest of the series, I devoured it & I wanted it to be longer."

0,"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.  Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.  The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.  All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.  The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!  In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!  Get this set and let Bette Davis show what great acting is."

Bed was comfortable, though, and the room was quiet, Hotel staff was polite, but not really interested in the guest. Even the concierge was disinterested.

Oh, and did I mention I'm very happily married?  The best word I can think of to describe this book is ""addicting.""  I read the almost 500 page novel in only a few days and read the following two books in a week.  Then, I read this one again because I was starving to have my dose of Edward!

The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2.

0,"Snapbridge is a joke bordering on fraud.  I ordered the camera and waited 8 months for delivery in order to take wildlife photos. The remote control was vital to my work.  Spent and entire day trying to get remote control to work.  I was using an I-phone 6s and all the latest software and it wanted a wifi connection as well as bluetooth.  Either one did not work.  I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.  If i made claims in my business like Nikon made in selling me this camera I would be in jail for fraud."

0,"Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see. The room we had at almost $400 a night was dingy and small. Don't mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there, it isn't. They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items. The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods. When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasn't a choice. The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again, we called the Manager who did get it to us. The staff did appear friendly, although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb' sign and would call us on the phone. Don't make the mistake of staying here but if you do, walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $3 plus 19% gratuity. We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us. This is the most overpriced, over rated and dingy hotel we've ever stayed in. Taxi to airport is $40."

She captivates us with her ability to make us swoon over the leading man, wish we were the so called ""Friends with benefits"" girl, humor, girlfriend banter, intrigue and more! The two leading characters (Abby and Edwin) have a past and even live together. Edwin wants more than friendship and can't stand seeing the woman he still loves dating other men and intrigues her with the idea of ""friends with benefits"" to get things started again with them. I enjoyed the sexual tension, passion, swooning and fabulous love that is shown/shared in this book! Despite the love of the book there was anger and frustration felt and wanting to know answers to questions... and cannot wait until the next book to see where Christa takes us with these two friends/lovers!! There is an element of mystery in this book as well and I am intrigued and interested in seeing where Christa will take us with that also in the next book/books since there will be 2 more in this series!"

0,"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.  However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.  If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago."
0,Avery Flynn has a wonderful light and flirty touch in this fast-paced romance. The love-hate relationship of Keisha Jacobs and Gabe Campos is very sexy. His desire for revenge against her father adds drama  to their attraction. I enjoyed the colorful cast of characters. They are a lively bunch. The dialogue was very humorous and their romance very sensual. Keisha and Gabe are a unique couple who captured me from page one. I enjoyed their fight for a HEA.

0,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. Staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. The rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen TV's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. My room even had a view of Monroe St. harbor. It is truly a first-rate hotel. Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown Chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park, the Aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave. I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic! Room service for breakfast was quite good as well. Overall, I'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop, or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks."

I use this for cooking in the oven.  I leave the timer outside and put the meat in with the thermometers and this works fine.  I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.  I'd recommend this, I've used it a couple times now without issue.  There is an on/off switch too which should help with the battery."

0,"My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. I'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. At check-in, I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile. It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush. Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. Our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large 'living room' and a large bedroom. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. If I would have payed full price for this suite, I probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here, I decided to give it a five. It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. We found the food and service mediocre. The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the 'Sinatra Booth' which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. The Ambassador East is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. The staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. When we are in Chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again."

Room was great -- very clean, good closet space and fantastic bedding. Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar, but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. Concierge was helpful, too.

0,"By reputation, Meryl Streep seals her legend in this hardly observed crime who-dunnit receiving no Oscar nod or Academy mention for a performance that is astoundingly real in its exactness in the character of Lindy Chamberlain charged with the murder of her own daughter in the Australia back water, near Alice Springs, along with her husband Michael (Sam Neill), both devout Christians, a case that was solved a year after the picture's release. It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema. If you followed this film with ""Silkwood"" you would see two distinct individuals played by the same actress. And, of course, Meryl Streep continues to stretch our imaginations. The supporting cast is familiar to those who fancy Australian offerings. However, this film is unique in its documentary feel with artistic touches, like complete authenticity to the decent character of the principals, that heighten its impact. Here, the viewers as well as the lead characters are tested by fire and survive. This is a Streep performance you must see."

0,"I really love this whole series. They are so fun and sexy!  And they really take to heart the fact they we need to accept love in all its forms. This book did not disappoint in any regard. I highly recommend the whole series!  I really enjoyed Stella's character. She was very realistic, down to her insecurities. Because we all know sometimes we aren't as confident with our bodies as we would like to be. I loved how the two guys were each their own person. They had completely different personalities which lead to different working relationships and what people thought of them. I thought that was really unique because often it seems multiple characters will start to essentially merge into one.  The love aspect between Stella and the men in this book was a little hard to believe compared to some of the other books. It felt a little rushed. But beyond that I loved it! Still absolutely worth the read!!"

Typically I rate movies as ""I would watch anytime"", ""I would watch again at some point"", ""if it was on I might watch it if someone else was"" or ""not worth watching'. This gets a ""If it was on I might watch it if someone else was"" wathing it."

0,"I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007. I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night. However, this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor. EXCELLENT view of the city, river and Lake Michigan. In fact, I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity. The room was huge, and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice. The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park. Would very much recommend this hotel, and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor."

0,"As a former sporting goods purchasing agent for Kmart about 15-16 years ago - when the first mass production of metal scooters were being imported from China - I can say that I've seen a few scooters in my lifetime. Some of those sample scooters lasted me until today - scooters my kids can still enjoy these days. This is a scooter with a great concept for power - it's all manual yet very simple to operate. The one big issue I have with this item that otherwise claims to hold riders up to 90 kg =200lbs(surprisingly, this is the same weight limit as the jr. model, which is aimed at 4-8 year olds) is the following: the plastic enclosure at the bottom of the scooter, the part that holds a wire and is close to the ground seems extremely fragile. I venture to say if a kid rides on the sidewalk and then decides to go jump on the street, that plastic piece could easily get smashed in the sidewalk corner, and render the entire scooter useless."

The only complaint is that the cover is very thick.  This is a problem for most people.  I will have to order another one.  I will update this review if I ever need to use this item again.I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house. The netting was very nice and easy to install. I was able to keep it and put it in my closet without it getting in the way of my work. The netting is very sturdy and I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it and do not want it to get in the way of your work. My only negative would be that it does not have a vent that can be used for air. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to keep their rifle and shotgun in the bag.I have been using this for a few months now and I have been very happy with it. It is easy to set up and I can use it on my back porch. It is very comfortable and I like it. I would recommend this product to anyone.I use this daily for my small water bottle.

I've used this brand for years and have never had a problem.  They cost more than some lesser brands but I probably would have had to replace a lesser brand many times over so I look at it like I'm saving money in the long run.

0,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.  The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.  they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.  Overall i am very happy with this purchase. met all expectations."

1,"In an attempt to construct a more believable story, I've decided to turn my attention to the historical background. This is the story of the first American soldiers who fought in the Pacific during World War II. The film's premise is that the American troops who died in the war were forced to return to their country to fight in the Pacific. They were forced to leave the Pacific because of the threat of Japanese attack on American soil. This is a well-developed story that uses historical facts to fill in the gaps."
0,"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.  So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.  The dog accessory industry is so vast, yet this is one of the must underrated necessities.  I have NEVER found anything like this in stores.  I'm glad someone thought of making them.  Bravo Alcott.... Bravo."

0,"admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.  In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow."

If you're not a writer read this book for the same reason. She is incredibly talented - SYU is very lucky to have her on their staff. I could sit and read this book over and over and over again.

0,"Does what it is supposed to for about 6 months then the 2nd output starts to loose sync (may be a heat issue).  Will be watching a movie on the 2nd output and the TV will loose signal, then about 10 seconds latter the signal will return.  This only happens on the 2nd output as others have had the same problem.  Also sometimes the switching wouldn't switch on the first try, would change to a different input and back then it will work (did this from the time it was new).  I just programmed my remote to automatically switch back and forth when I turned on my TV."

1,"Great wide angle and clear sound. The only problem is that it's not really a stereo, but a pair of ear buds. The ear buds themselves have a ""good"" sound, but it's not clear enough to tell which is which.

0,"Beautiful earrings! These were delivered to me by my mailman during the middle of my annual memorial day party. Everyone kept asking what did you get??? What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday. These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol. I and the rest of my family would recommend them. They are small, but impressive. It is true what they say that good things come in small packages. I did receive these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."

I'm going to keep on, keeping on so that I can see some more results. I'm excited about that. Thank you for the recipes and thank you for actually EXPLAINING hormones, along with the detox.

0,Ever need to use your computer and not sit in front of it?  I do all the time.  I use my computer to learn the guitar so having to scoot over to my computer just to hit a space bar or some-such is a pain in the behind.  I thought this would be something to try and see if it helped.  It sure has.  Being able to use my mouse from across the room is a godsend. Once i got used to the motions of it it was second nature to click on whatever I needed. Really useful for me.  If I was in an office setting where I had to give frequent presentations this would be great.  Really nice product. I was really impressed with how well it worked. The only wish I had with this product was to have a little more documentation.  The only help info is on the box and that doesn't cover much.  I was able to figure it out but it would be nice to have a bit more. I did get a disocunt on this product but that did not affect my view on it.  I really think this is a nice air mouse.

1,"Seraphim Falls, boldly shot in the heart, with the voice of a man who is the leader of the self-proclaimed ""Godfather of the Tomb."" The film is a great tribute to the man and his art.  The film was shot in 24 hours, and the camera angles were spectacular. The film was shot in the park, and the locations were filmed in the mountainous terrain. The main subject matter was not the film itself, but the impact of a well-known story on the lives of the men who made it.  The film is presented as a beautiful film, and it shows that the people who made it were courageous and brave. The film shows the people who made it as well as the people who gave it their all to make it a reality. It is a great film to watch, and it is a story that is about a man and his art. It is a movie that shows that the people who made it had faith, and were willing to sacrifice their lives to make it a reality"
0,"I am not ashamed to say that I begged  BEGGED  for a second book after reading the first in the Tutorials and Tools series from the excellent contributors at Indies Unlimited. At first, I was told there would not be a second book. I was disappointed but understood that a book with so much information, pictures, and numerous authors is difficult to put together. You can imagine my joy when I received the message that a second book had been published (huge grin!).  Needless to say, my kindle is packed full of notes I need to transcribe on all I learned and wonderful, ingenious ideas shared. Many thanks to the most bodacious contributors at Indies Unlimited! If there is ever a third book (hint-hint), you know who to tell first!"

0,"This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.  I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.  I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot."
0,"DMG is an adaptogen (sort of like Ginseng for us) for animals.  I have an older cat who I am hoping will benefit from this as it's supposed to help enhance circulation and muscle recovery.  From my research, DMG is produced naturally by both animals and humans and it's supposed to boost immune response (by over 400%!). It can also support skin health, glucose metabolism and brain function.  I am hoping that this will be helpful for her to make her aging process healthier. My husband and I take 'people' adaptogens for our health so why not one for your pets health as well. Good for dogs, cats and birds too."

It's not waterproof so it's not very warm and rainy.  The brim is a nice touch as well.  I also like the fact that it folds up so you can use it as a helmet cover.  I think that's important because it allows you to carry around a phone or other items when riding.  The pockets are nice and easy to store.  I'm a huge fan of the long handle bar so I wanted to try out this one.  I'll be ordering another one and shipping out to my destination.  I can't tell you how many times I've worn it.

0,"My introduction to Sophia Henry and her Pilots series was through Power Play. Gaby and Landon had a meaty story but there was a disconnect for me. So I decided to try again with Interference. Ms. Henry is consistent in her willingness to tackle subjects that are painful. From the beginning she delivers that one, two punch. Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood. From abandonment and trust issues, to an attraction that pulls the scab off a partially healed wound. Linden has worked to become a responsible young woman. An act of rebellion in her teens left her with more responsibility than she expected and the shame of disappointment. Interference redeemed Sophia Henry in my eyes. Sympathy, empathy and hope are the stepping stones to an amazing and inspirational story."

0,"Thank god I got this hotel through priceline. I can't imagine paying full price for this place. The tub was moldy and dingy. The toilet didn't flush. Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least. Unless you wanted to pay $5 for a rerun of an NBC show. Oh, and internet? Why that will set you back about $15 for the day. And breakfast? That's about $16 for a cup of coffee, a croissant and two slices of honeydew. This hotel is the pits. The customer service is....absent! When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby (decked out like some bad late 80's prom) there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in. And once you're there, check in is very fast, i'll grant them that. This hotel is a big, crummy rip-off. I will never stay here (and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe)."
0,I finally found jeans that fit the way I like. They are soft and comfortable with just the right amount of room where it counts. It's the reason I bought six pair in different colors. The only drawback is the zipper handle often gets stuck in the material when the zipper is all the way down. Minor but irritating. I will definitely buy these again. There were a lot more colors than the six I bought.

I do not believe the publisher should be allowed to get away with writing a book that is so clearly written and so clearly in the mind of the reader.

I have read other books by the author but this one, which I have read before, was a great addition to my library.  I do not think it is necessary for a book to be a good introduction to the topic of drug abuse.  It is a great book to read for anyone who has a history of drug abuse.

It collapses to easily (just while playing), the gears do not stay on- as soon as you turn either on the end they ALL pop off, and the nails pretty much fall right into the holes. If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy). If you have a toddler that is more interested in tinkering rather than necessarily playing (like my little guy), check out Speedy, NOT this workbench!"

The location was perfect, just off Michigan Avenue,on the Chicago River, so it was easy to walk down the Mag Mile and get to all of the shops without having to pay for cabs or rent a car. The hotel is right next the The Palm restaurant, and within walking distance of several places to eat, both fancy (China Grill, yum!)and affordable (Corner Bakery). The rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. We were lucky to get a room with a good view...be sure to ask that you do not have a view of the office building next door! The lobby is typical Hyatt, big and spacious with lots of plants. Service was good. All around an excellent experience and a great deal."

The texture on the sole of your foot feels good, and is ""dryer"" than some other flip flops/ other materials/ that is, less slippery if wet.  I probably didn't explain that well  but you know what I mean, I hope.  The shoes are attractive, comfortable, convenient, I've been wearing them daily!!  I do find I have a contact sensitivity which might limit my ability to wear these.  I.e, allergy to rubber or some component.  The red is worse, unfortunately, my feet broke out in itchy rash.  It might be from the red dye.  But, I am not giving up too easily, as I've worn these many times before the skin/ foot concern occurred.  I really hope I can keep wearing these.  I have others in rubber that I can wear but not for long periods.  Perhaps these will be similar.  I have them in gray and red.  I will keep trying to wear them for shorter, or hopefully for longer periods, as they really are just about perfect.  I hate when I react to a clothing item I love.

There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time, let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us, because things like alarm clocks, hairdryers and ironing boards were already there, electronic media even available for rent. With a comfortable bed, control over how the room felt, no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call, we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity. Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning, but the Hilton was a true vacation. Thank you."

0,"We stayed at Omni Chicago for 2 nights in early July (July 1-3). The reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo. We got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages. I also signed up for their loyalty program, which was so worth it. I was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. But I was totally wrong! They treated us extremely well. Before our arrival, I got an email asking if we needed anything. So, I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. And they arranged it for us without charge :) We arrived late on Thursday night. Our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge I requested. We were given a corner suite on the 10th floor...very nice room...comfy bed. My husband was really wowwwww!!! The bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed (we didn't use the sofa-bed though). We got a high-speed Internet as part of the loyalty program. All staff were friendly and helpful...front desk, valet parking, bell boy, room service, concierge,... everyone! We used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning. The first day was great. Food was great, and quick. We also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. We ordered OJ and hot chocolate. They both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. But we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. It tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate :( Also, we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast, which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries...but we got a plain waffle. So, we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. This is why I didn't give '5' for service. However, I reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out, and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. Another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. We could hear siren going on & off during the night. But this is out of the hotel's control though. And I would say that it didn't bother us at all. My baby could sleep very well. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider Omni for our next trip to Chicago."

1,"The Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. First of all, it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. If you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. When I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in, and I thought the wait time was ridiculous. To make matters worse, I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room. Two hours later they managed it get to work, the connection was still very slow. For my part, the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. I was disappointed and will never stay there again, if I go back to Chicago. If was rating it, I would give it 1/2 star out of 5."

0,"The Fulcrum 30030-308 wireless remote LED light is a simple and effective way to add light to a room or a closet that doesn't already have a light and a light switch. It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.  In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.  My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.  Bottom line, this works and I'm mostly happy with it, but I'd be even happier if the light fixture was ""flatter"" from front to back and the remote light switch was smaller."

The curvy woman is deep in the alpha's clutches, and things heat up as an old friend gets in between the two and makes things a proper love triangle.  Kate must wrangle with her feelings for the unreachable and powerful alpha shifter, or her classmate, who's genuinely sexy and possessive in his own ways. I loved the tension and explosive moments between all these characters.

I can't say it was ""bad"" so I gave it the 3 just as a point of neutrality, which is to say nothing happened. Cats are funny though- maybe it's just my cat. I tried it, but she didn't even raise her nose or twitch a whisker. It certainly didn't entice her into her box. I suspect she had other issues for a while (it may be an age thing) that has made her box habits slip. Mostly now she's using it again (without using this product) - although she tends to favor one corner so much it's a bit of a problem, and sometimes over-shoots or just stops on the edge and wees outside of the box.

The characters are well developed and the storyline is full of action. I really liked the characters and I can't wait to see what happens next."
1,"I recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel, Chicago. The hotel sells itself as being stylish, sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. I would have been better off anywhere else. I was not impressed with the interior, finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. I guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds, but not mine. Also, luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. When I made my way to reception, I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. I had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room, and thought the extra space would come in handy. When I proceeded to check in, the girl at the desk told me, while smacking gum, that I had no reservation. I handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though I had spelled it out for her. She then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is a step down from the room I had asked for! Surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! I said that no, I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if I wanted to switch the following evening, I would be welcome to do that. The room was ok, although, again, I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. I did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. Some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! There was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. I did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. The fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using, were closed for cleaning when I went up. Breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items, which is not what I would have expected for the money. All in all, I would say your money is better spent elsewhere."

0,"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.  A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price."

Now I'm reading the novels and finding out thing and filling in gaps I never knew. Its great to suddenly understand why X did this, or Q did that!

0,"Ms Wylde does it again in this second installment of the Fairweather Sisters. I enjoyed reading it especially George (Lord Elmer's) antics.  I like how the author laces humor in this genre and manages to explain the difference between true love and infatuation.  Celine/Amy has her head over the clouds blinded by love when she loved those hideous poems. When she and George fought both of them made sense and I liked how they improved for each other.  Of all the places a duchess could give birth to, only Penelope could pull it off. Both Celine/Amy and George had brushes with danger and they always manage to get out unscathed.  I'd highly recommend this novel to those of you looking for a fun and light reading. Some scenes were hilarious I literally laughed out loud. More power Ms Wylde!"

0,"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.  I'll be looking to add the next parts of this series to my collection."

I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly, which you don't often see at other hotels. I used the self-check in machine, and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly.

Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago.

Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).  While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.

0,"I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.  Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.

The first book is about a boy who has been with his father for a while, and it is a very interesting story about his childhood. I also liked the ending. I liked the fact that it is a story about an old woman who has been living with her father for a while, and she has been moved into a small town with her mother"

I did not want to waste the money on a product I already had for my computer, so I went with this one.

1,"I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago while I was on holiday recently and I have to say, that you definitely get what you pay for! I was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised. I was sorely mistaken. The first problem I had was when I got there they told me that they had double booked the suite I had reserved. They gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room. I should have left then but I decided to keep an open mind. After we were all settled in my husband and I went to The Palm restaurant. My husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times. Each time we asked them to fix it, they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff. After dinner, we went back to our room. Just sitting on the bed I knew it would be a long night. The mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them. When I went to the restroom, the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons! My husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one. We just didn't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in. I tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional. He pressed really had and hurt my back. Perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session! For lunch we tried Geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way. I decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later! Once I got sick, I was done. I went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because I was not going to sleep there one more night. I made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable. After a lot of arguing, he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel. This was the worst place I had ever stayed! I think a Super 8 Motel would have been more luxurious!"

0,"Ordinary action flicks suffer from the affliction of predictability.  We all know that the gun wielding tough guy will systematically destroy all of his enemies and heroically beat the boss after a more difficult battle at the end.  If you are tired of these kinds of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead.  What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never ceases to be entertaining.  Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot.  So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away.  But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stakes of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire.  As you can see, it has all of the staples of an action flick.  Superb character development and visual effects make this a must-see action movie with a great plot twist."

0,"My cat, Raoul purchased this during a nocturnal shopping spree. We got him his own credit card with the hope that occasional nighttime internet shopping would entertain him while the rest of the household slept. This works out pretty well most of the time as he usually purchases small inexpensive items such as cans of tuna, bags of Pounce, and electronic dog whistles.  One night, however, he watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0036SLOP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>&nbsp;on Amazon Instant Video and he became extremely interested in flying.  For a few weeks he would climb up on to a tall bookcase and spring, legs outstretched, usually on to the sleeping dog, but sometimes at any unsuspecting passerby.  He must have eventually become bored with free flight because this Cat Airplane arrived one day. Raoul set upon assembling the cardboard pieces and although he was quite methodical, it was beyond his physical ability to complete the job. Of course, we assisted him; the propeller assembly being extremely difficult even for us with thumbs.  At last, the cat airplane was finished and the first thing we noticed is that the cockpit was rather a tight squeeze for a big fellah like Raoul.  He was quite determined and was barely able to squeeze himself in, but he eventually did.  Once in, he really looked fantastic! Purring like mad, he tried to find the controls, but there were none.  Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!  It took lots of explaining on our part to convince Raoul that he had not purchased a real plane but merely a toy. He is quite disillusioned now. He mostly sleeps or sits and stares off into the far distance, a cat with shattered dreams.  Please don't let this happen to your cat!"

They eat !  We have a chihuahua mix and two New Mexican terriers.  They have  slightly different menus, but share the same kibble.  I was not able to see any difference with the bigger dogs in eating the two kibbles.  Seemed to be all the same.  Point being, it was apparently eaten equally in both cases.  That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.  A three becomes a four.  Bigger dogs, just another kibble.

0,"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.   If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.   Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.   I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.   Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two."
0,"This movie is as funny as parts of the other 2 at times but i wouldnt say its as good. It has some funny moments but also some very stupid non funny moments. The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator. Overall i give it 3 and a half stars. Pretty good."

0,"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function. But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails. btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.   I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical""."

1,"I selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago. We chose the hotel for it's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location. In retrospect, the phrase 'location, location, location' apparently does not apply to hotels. It's a good thing the location was so great, because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. Upon our arrival, our room was not ready. The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation, and told us simply that 'we would have to wait' without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. When we finally arrived in the room, the sheets were not clean. A call to housekeeping proved difficult, as I do not speak Spanish. The second day of our trip, housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our 'please service' sign hung on the door. We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave. When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order, it was cold and not very good. Despite these poor impressions, the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout. My call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai. They will not receive my business again."

Bath products were by Crabtree & Evelyn and included shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash and bady lotion. Plenty of coffee was provided. We drank and had snacks at Kitty O'Shea's. The crowd was fun and there was live Irish folk music each night. Good selection of beer and good Shepards Pie, Cheese Dip and Crisps! The location worked very well for us. We walked to the Art Museum and Buddy Guys Blues Club is right across the street. And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle! The cab ride to the Museum of Science and Industry was quite far though and cost about $15 each way. An excellent weekend getaway!"

Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.  The product description is a little strange - ""LED Incandescent"" - it's LED, not incandescent. It's also non-dimmable per the packaging."

The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely. The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."

0,"I got this cover with the idea of having a spare in case I messed up removing material to make the Qi adapter fit better (trying to reduce the lump it makes). It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish. If it's actually ""rubberized"", then it's the thinnest rubber coating I've ever seen. If I ordered this with the intention of not using it with a case and having a grippy rear cover, I'd be pretty upset. Really, for my own purposes this is a 5 star product, but I think if I didn't have this narrow use-case, I'd have called it 4 stars. So there ya go."

More computer-generated graphics than....  When will these awful movies ever end?  ____________________________ * The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

1,"So far I really like this mat, the materials are good and easy to use. I'm very pleased with the quality and the design. I would recommend this mat to anyone looking for a mat that is comfortable and easy to use. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a friend who has a pack of this that he keeps in his truck. We bought a second pack of this for his and we both love it. It is a little uncomfortable and I had to go back and forth to put the pack on. I'm happy with the purchase."
1,My 10 1/2 year old African Greyhound was very comfortable in it. He loves to scratch and gnaw on the leash. He also likes to play fetch with it. We bought it for his new toy. He was excited to get it for his new toy. We gave it to a friend and it has been great. It is a little heavier than I expected but still works well. I am happy with it.
0,Fun little snowboard to use in the backyard or local hill. Small kid sized and easy for them to get in and out of the boot straps. Only downside is: it's boring looking. Kids want graphics/colors/decals/etc. Lucky Bums make ones that look way better !

0,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.  I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""  Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.  Literary Marie of Precision Reviews"

0,"Love this watch. I've got several of their AMW320 and also AMW330 series, and I'm very pleased with all of them. This also comes in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both.  I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sports but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses. Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.  This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious. I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great. The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.  I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.  There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these all really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it). I found mine for around $30 shipped. Prices fluctuate, so do shop around."

0,"Bunnies are of course prolific breeders.  But they can also make for some extaordinarily brutal killers.  Slasher fans need to hop! hop! on this dvd quick.  Writer/director Chad Ferrin (Someone's Knocking At the Door) is quickly establishing himself as a cult horror stud.  This movie is darn near perfect, melding violence, nudity, and touches of dark comedy with some very likeable protagonists and despicable villains.  Just some great writing, acting, pacing, characters, camerawork, bloody effects--this is all done in a very stylish, original fashion.  It's Easter time.  Mindy is the single mother of her 16-yr-old son Nicholas, who is mentally-disabled and has a hard time coping with the loss of his father.  When Mom brings home her new boyfriend Remington, the young kid instinctually puts up the red flag.  Then when Mindy leaves for work, we get to see first hand what a total scumbag this dude really is.  He invites over some prostitutes and other degenerate sleazeball buddies and the party is about to get bloody.  A mysterious killer in a bunny mask is ready to hunt, and it's more than Easter eggs that are going to dye.  Easter Bunny Kill! Kill! is undeniably a spectacular low budget gem!  4.5 stars.

0,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.  I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.  Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

0,"I have put a good portion of time and thought into reviewing this product. Overall, I have determined it deserves 5 stars. I have taken several photos which show the condition when it arrived.  Pros: Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, many easy to access pouches, comes with carrying case, price, size (fits in trunk yet still large enough to enjoy)  Cons: Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much  I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you. The amount of places to store things tends to be a bit much for the display aspect. Overall, this is a solid chair."

0,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.  I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new. Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.  The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.  The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.  Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.  Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

0,"**UPDATED** I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!  If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.  I have been wearing it nearly every day since it arrived and have been quite happy with it."

1,"My last Rottweiler, Jet, was a little too big for him.  We tried a variety of pet bedding and we had to get a larger one for him.  After a lot of research we decided to try this one.  We were skeptical about the size of the bedding but we were a bit surprised at how well it worked.  It's a bit big for him but it's just right.  It's a nice size for a large dog.  We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.  It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.

The World Tag Team title match between Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez against Joey Ryan & Matt Morgan was More of the same, not bad, a bit sloppy at times, but more of a TV style match than a PPV match. See a pattern here? The Bully Ray-Austin Aries match was a Good match even with the bad finish. The Knocksout title match between Tara & Mickie James was pretty good match even if we did see too much Jesse. The 8 man tag team match between Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Garett Bischoff and Wes Briscoe against Four Members of Aces and 8s (Doc, Devon, Masked Man and Masked Man) was another solid, but unspectacular match. The AJ Styles-Christopher Daniels match was a really good match, but the crowd did it no favors, which is a shame and the story of the night.

1,"When I went to The James hotel in Chicago I truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising. Gorgeous chairs, staff at the desk focusing on their job, and a clean, well decorated hotel room. Much to my, and my wallet's dismay I found quite the opposite. I arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed, and found the clerk reading a magazine. It must have been a fascinating article, as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation, or would be making one. I said I had one, and gave him the voucher I'd printed out. He checked it, and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out, he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night. I grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep. The clerk offered to walk me to my room, saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep. I accepted, and followed him to my new room. He carried the briefcase I had with me, but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free. He ushered me into my room, setting the briefcase down inside, and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. I thanked him and closed the door. It was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying. What was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6' apart, covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. The cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. A quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap, not even the complementary ones were left behind. I got ready for bed, and looked around for the TV remote, which it turned out, had no batteries in it. Instead, I just turned out the lights and rolled over, sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. In the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. I'd had enough of the hotel after one night. The clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. $240 for my room, and an extra $80 with a note about a baggage service. I asked her about it, and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. I asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up, and riding the elevator, and she said it was unusual, but not unheard of. She offered to change it to a 'mere' $20 and handed me a slip with a phone number, name, and reason for the disagreement, saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it. I did so, and left, my wallet $260 lighter, and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep."

Dog can't slip out by pulling forward, but if he freaks out and spins and pulls backward, it could happen. I KNEW it could happen.  It did happen - in the middle of Hollywood.  He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own. Driver waved me up the street, ""He's here!"" Pointed to his yellow mini-van/taxi. I thought he meant he was hiding underneath - no, he was locked in the back seat.  I had 2 large dogs for over a decade, always had them on either a choker or a secure harness, to avoid my greatest fear of them getting loose. Never happened, they both passed away recently within 6 months of each other. Found this little guy in between, almost lost him because of this harness. Yes - it was on snug. It's not a secure design. Look at it!  Thanks to that taxi driver, I now believe in miracles, but I have zero faith in this harness and am throwing it away when I get home - no matter what my girlfriend says."

0,"M. Robinson did it again! This book is amazing! Brilliant.  This is a spin off of the VIP trilogy. We've met Brooke and Devon in VIP but now it's thier turn to tell the story. They are both so broken that to others they only show their facade. At the beginning of the story Brooke is 16 and just like every 16yo girl she is full of hope and dreams. But in her case, those dreams and hope dissapear and she closes herself and becomes very good VIP. It's all about sex and pleasure. Devon's life wasn't an easy one. He knows how hard you have to work to get something in life. They are both broken and they need each other if they admit it or not. At first there is very beautiful friendship, but they both know there is more. So much more. Their story is full of pain and loss, but also full of love, hope and scorching hot scenes. Whoa, M. Robinson knows how to write hot scenes. Reading this book I cried, I laughed, I swooned and I was fanning myself. This book is amazing.  Can't wait for more from M. Robinson."

They more than compensated me for the inconvenience and were both professional and friendly in their dealings with me. Once powered, the unit operated exactly as promised (read the provided documentation!). The Bluetooth signal reach was at 20 feet, more than adequate for my purposes. Various lanyards and rings (like key rings) work well with the remote. Once I settled on a lanyard and memorized the keypad arrangement, it was useful when I had to operate will keeping my eyes and attention focused on a specific task.

Plush toys don't last with her because she'll find the seams, rip a hole, and pull out the stuffing. But she HATES stuffing-free toys. So when this came up on my amazon reccomended list, I thought it was the perfect hybrid and bought it immediately. Bella loves it! As we predicted, she destroyed the penguin head, but the body is holding up remarkably well. Her new favorite toy is this headless penguin.

I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.  Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.  As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.  The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.  Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's.

What I love about JR Ward is the fact that she introduces these main characters in earlier books so when the book finally comes up for them, they are already pretty developed and then you pop right into the story.  the way she twists it around and brings in stories on existing Brothers is also great.  Some series books will have the main characters and then you never see them again.  Not so with this series.  I keep thinking where is she going to go with this now, and she keeps surprising us.  Great read but you need to have read the priors to understand what is going on."

Yet, there was so much more to this big, lovable rake.  Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.  Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)  Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises.

She's a bit lazy but I think this is the only toy she can destroy.  I love the fact that she can be a little bit lazy so she doesn't get excited when she sees me putting the toy on.  I like that the toy is made from real wood so it is easy to assemble.  I love that it is made in the USA so it will last a long time.  The toy is not too big for my 14 lb pit mix but I like that it is made in the USA.  I can't imagine a toy that is made in the USA without some of the components made in the USA.

0,"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.  The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.  Pros: *Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy  Cons: *Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)  Additional Considerations: Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.  Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars  If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."

1,"Not worth the price! I had the unfortunate experience of staying in the Hilton Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. I stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. I wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else. With a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. Not a chance. In addition to the $259 price tag, I also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. If I had stayed at the Motel 6, parking would have been free. The staff there were not very nice at all. When I registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. She was very rude to me. Perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but I doubt it. After I arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). The rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. I didn't go on vacation to cook though. The television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). I tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the 'complimentary' internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. I get a better connection at Starbucks. They offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. I've had better food at McDonald's. The food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. Traffic around the hotel was hideous. This hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. There are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. The room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. If you're looking for a hotel in Chicago, I'd say save some money and go somewhere else. I've had better stays at the Best Western and many other hotels that cost less."

0,"Pluses: The base appears to be strong, well designed, and well made.  The armature is also strong and adequately rigid.  The adjustment is reasonably easy and keeps it's place without causing damage to the armature. And, the bolt at the top of the armature is strong and rigid. Minus:  The corded loop does not hold without risking strangling.  I would much prefer something that was adjustable and had a break-away connector to assure that it would not injure my dog(s) if they became desperate to escape the grooming table.  I am currently looking for a replacement for the loop. All said, I would buy this product again for my 65 pound poodle, especially after her matures enough to stand more steadily for grooming.  I have never found a lead that I found completely adequate, so I forgive Master Equipment for not satisfying my desires on this grooming stand.  I have never used a stand for a dog larger than 80 pounds; when I had Newfoundlands, I groomed them on the floor."
0,"This emotionally packed romance had me laughing out loud one moment and crying the next!  The characters are honest, real and very refreshing.  A story about real life troubles in the peerage and the way real people get through them.  While the rules of English edict control,  Bryce writes without all the silly debutante drama found in many historical romances, without shallow characters that can never make up their minds and without pages and pages of explicit love scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"

I have used them for everything from baking to using a coffee pot.  I use them to heat up the coffee, to make a quick pot of tea, or to make a quick cup of soup.  I just put them in the fridge for a few minutes, then put them in the fridge for a few minutes to get them warmed up.  You can also make a cup of coffee with them, and then put them in the refrigerator for a couple days to make sure they don't get too hot.  I have been using them to heat up my coffee for about a month now, and I love how they keep the coffee hot for a long time.  I also like how they are easy to clean.

0,"This book was a recommendation of my reading group. Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.  I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight. The writing was good, there was NO foul language or explicit scenes. I would classify this book as a ""cozy."" And while it was good and well-written, it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, unable to put it down, so I give it four stars."

Thus, your smartphone interacts with Honeywell's off-site server and not directly within-your-house with your thermostat unit."

I have had no problems with them getting into their food.

However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.  I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.  This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."

0,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.  I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.  As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.  Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.  Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

0,"I am so glad I got to read this book. It turned out to be an excellent book with a message that I definitely needed to hear.  I was unsure if I would benefit from this book. After all, I don't really have any enemies, not in the human form anyway. But i do at times battle addiction, fear, anxiety, depression... would this book help me understand God's purpose for our own internal struggles?  The answer is yes. Anything you face - any person, any struggle, any weakness - may feel like an enemy. But sometimes your enemy is your best opportunity. ALL things work together for good! God may use an enemy to bring about your great purpose & destiny. But it is all worth it in the end!  Life can be hard. It seems like we have barely made it through one battle, when we're facing another. But this book is a great encouragement & testimony to the fact that God is with us & sees us face our enemies. He knows, and it isn't him punishing or being angry with us! He is actually just using these trials to promote us to the next level.  I think this book was well-written. I also liked how it was broken down into short chapters. It made it seem like an easier read that way! Ron Carpenter used personal examples, too, which was very helpful in knowing that He has been through some HARD TIMES as a pastor but that God truly brought him through it!"

0,"Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years. You will be far safer, in my opinion, with a dedicated CO detector like the CO615, and and a non-10-year smoke detector."

Actually, don't buy those because this will probably go right into the garbage.  The noise is audible to people. Barely, but you can hear it. The noise is really high-pitched and irritating so instead of making my dog shut up, it just made him bark louder. You know how most dogs are with vacuum cleaners? That's how my dog is with the Bark-Off. He'll chase after it and bark bark bark until I turn it off. I tried leaving him alone with it on and it only agitated him further and made his anxiety worse.

First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.   After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!  I am more than impressed with the durability of this kite, and would definitely recommend it.  It's prefect for children and adults.  Product was provided for a fair and honest evaluation."

0,"Desert Of Souls is the highly recommended first novel of an Arabian Nights-style series by the new author, Howard Andrew Jones.  As many other reviewers have already somewhat detailed the storyline, suffice it to say it relates the adventures of a scholar and the captain of the guard of a member in the government of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid as they go in search of a powerful magical tablet.  Being chased by an evil spy and a Magi, they encounter a lost city in the desert, a djinn, a desert of actual souls (hence, the title), and other beings and objects, natural and magical.  It's written in the style of the Arabian Nights but with an emphasis on the action-adventure of a sword-and-sorcery tale.  The author also conjures up new magical creations and beings not found in the typical Arabian Nights tale.  I'm anxiously looking forward to the next book in the exciting tales of the two intrepid heroes as they adventure across the Arabian Nights-style world of Howard Andrew Jones."

It's a bit loud, but I would prefer to have it at 1/2 the volume.  Overall, it's a great projector, and the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not quite as bright as the HDTV that I have. It's not the brightest color, but that's not a big deal for me, but it's a big deal for me.  The only real issue I have with it is the remote.

0,"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.  Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth."

I believe it was removed. Also the nasal voice informing you that the speaker is on, what mode it's on and that bluetooth is paired is  bit annoying. Turning the volume all the way up will make a loud beeping sound letting you know you on max volume. The sound is really good though.

We had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren. My husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married. Everyone was so excited! Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites. We hadn't gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. Unfortunately, when we got to our room, the view was disappointing. We had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one, but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. I am asthmatic and became very ill. We asked to be moved to another room, but were told there were no other rooms (even downgrades) available. Nothing was done to try to make up for this. Because of my health, my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time. Now, when I think of my 10th anniversary, I will always have this memory to tarnish it."

0,"I have an impersonal and ever-so-slight connection to the Johnson family (unbeknownst to them) and I was eager to read a 'family history'. This book is not really that. Although it does impart so knowledge and insight, I doubt this book is a sanctioned review of the Johnson heirs. This is the 2nd or 3rd book I've read about America's wealthy elite and sadly, they all sound tragically alike. People without jobs and direction flounder to find purpose in their lives. Few find it in the solace of religion or any other worthy, yet non-lucrative means. This book saddened me, although, being part of the working class population, I did find it somewhat fascintation to see 'how the other 1% lives'."

I got 3 sizes, I figured I can try all on keep the one that fits and return the other two. The medium fits like an extra small, the large fits like a small, I kept the xL and it fits like a large. They have an elastic waistband which is wonderfully comfortable especially if you have a little extra tummy and they are high waisted which also adds to the comfort. They are very flattering , they don't squeeze your legs. These are a HUGE WINNER for any size woman These saved me for my weekend cookout . Thinking of buying more colors."

0,"How can this tiny speaker sound so amazingly good? The crisp trebles and excellent bass response are hard to believe. This little thing is a bit shorter than two stacked Coke cans and about the same width. I now use this one speaker in my magic shows, although I think I'll move to two, although two are not necessary. BTW, I've used the speaker both outdoors and indoors with excellent results. I first heard the UEB2 at a show by a fellow magician, and I looked for his speaker and couldn't see it...until he showed me his little UEB2. Whaaaat? So I bought one the next day. Good idea."

0,"I'm not surprised I enjoyed this story so much or that I read it so fast.  It only took me what seemed like an hour and some change to read the book.  I was intrigued by the characters and their stories.  I really liked how honest Kyra was about the problems former addicts face.  The dynamic between Ellie, Drew, and Jason was very interesting.  I felt bad for her being caught between two of the most important men in her life.  I found Jason and Drew's interactions to be fascinating .  There is a lot of history there and it made for some tense moments as well as emotional ones.  However, only part of it was shared and I'm hoping we'll get more if/when we get Jason's story.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this series develop and getting to know more about the band members and their stories. Kyra has written an emotional story that shows she's done a lot of research.  It's one I thoroughly enjoyed reading."

0,"I quite enjoyed this book, and not just because I like food, or am a fan of Ramsay (I confess to both). As a small shop owner, I found much information in this book useful even though I am not a restauranteur, and have referred to it often over the past year and some months I've had it. I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feels their business is in a bit of a rut. I can't say you will find direct examples, but if you keep your mind open you'll see the larger points he is making re: business. It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business, including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.  The only reason my review is not 5 stars is that it does repeat itself a bit at the end. This is also the fault of a great many business books, most of which do this to a much greater degree."

0,"Marion Myles has an incredible talent for drawing raw emotion from the reader and giving an almost preternatural insight into the emotional state of her characters, to the point that you as the reader are living those emotions.  Mental illness is a terrible and sad fact of life, and the ripple effects on the people around someone who suffers from a mental illness can be devastating in the extreme.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire."

Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932.

This was a little more difficult because you have to pull off one layer and stick it on the wall in the perfect location the first time or else you're in trouble.  Because this is a small wall decal it was pretty easy.  I recommend this for anyone with a weirdly placed bathroom that people often mistake for a closet =)
1,"I first saw this tool, it was an inexpensive and powerful saw. I have a large collection of other tools and this is the one.  The blade is a solid, strong, straight edge.  It is not stiff like a regular saw.  I use it to cut concrete with no problems.  I have the most common type of saw and it is a solid blade.  I use it on most of my projects and for small projects.  It is very versatile.  I have had no problems with the saw.  I am very pleased with this tool.  Pros: -Good for work -Excellent for small projects -Lightweight -Doesn't seem to take up a lot of room  Cons: -No grip on the saw, but it is sturdy  I have used this tool for a few months and it is still working well.

0,"This bicycle light mounted relatively easily to the handle bars of  my 20"" folding bike, but you do have to unscrew it totally to get it on.  The on/off button is easy to reach when riding. I really like that it uses 2 AA batteries instead of the button batteries some of the other lights use.  I also was happy that the batteries were already installed when I took it out of the box, especially since it came with no instructions.  This light is bright enough for  me to be seen in the early evening.  I haven't used it at night yet but have tested it in a dark house and it is very bright. The only little complaint is that you do have to totally unscrew the mount to take it off of the bike, and the little metal cylinder kept falling onto the ground.  Since I don't plan to take it off, I am thinking of adding a cable tie to make it more secure from theft."

0,"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.  I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.  Really a frustrating piece of crud to work with.  Keep looking."

However, I did not understand why the author had the lead character looking down on his mentor for not acting on his suspicions when the main character looked the otherway himself despite the evidence until someone died. Yet he lectured his mentor but does not mention his less than honorable actions and what it took for him to act on his suspisions. Anyway, I do recomend giving it a read."
0,Let me start out by stating I bought this as a gift for my brother. It gets points for the outside appearance and the fact that it has actual glass and not cheap plastic. The latch is okay. It does the job but could be improved in quality.  On the inside the is where it appears cheap to me and how you hve to set up the dividers.  I think they were aiming for you to be able to customize the set up but it comes off cheap to me. The dividers feel like the re little more than felt covered cardboard. Maybe I didn't read the discription fully I will have to recheck but I thought the diveiders were built in and that is why I was most disappointed.  I do like the fact that the cushions are removable because that mens you can store more than just watches in this case. It works well for almost any men's jewelry. I went ahead and gave three stars because if it wasn't for the dividers I would have been pleased with the purchase and maybe a better latch.  Needs to be better priced for what it is though. Just in my opinion.

Which is a shame because it is exactly as depicted with that beautiful intense color I love. I might try again, or Google what hat-sizes mean (seems like an archaic form of measurement), and relate that to centimeters or inches then measure my head first.

I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing issue or just a design issue.
0,"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.  Pros: 1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric. 2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine. 3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"". 4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.  Cons: 1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter). 2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap. 3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.  Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion."

0,"I am a huge Russo fan and have read most of his other books.  ""The Risk Pool"" is of nowhere near the same quality as ""Empire Falls"", ""Nobody's Fool"", ""Everybody's Fool"" or ""The Bridge of Sighs."" Having recently finished both ""Fool"" books, it was interesting to note the similarities between the characters SamHall/Don Sullivan and Eileen/Ruth and the towns of North Bath/Mohawk. It was almost as though ""The Risk Pool"" was a first draft of the later novels. All 3 books feature a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well major character, but he is so much more likable in the later 2 iterations. So, if you have limited time or patience and want to read one book about a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well in a dying upstate New York town, read ""Nobody's Fool."" It's fabulous, funny and endearing, while ""The Risk Pool"" is slow, depressing and boring."
0,"This book is immensely entertaining. The characters are well written, all different and with their own quirks.  The storyline is a fast-paced mix of mystery and romance with splashes of humour throughout.  Nadia is very likeable as the strong female main character and I loved the setting.  I look forward to seeing where this series goes.  Recommended to anyone who likes their mystery novels with a side of romance!"

It had to be able to go to the front of the bench to get the gap closed.  I would not recommend the smaller one.  I am not sure how long it will hold up to the heavier ones.  I do not have a bike and I don't know how long it will hold up.  I will update if I get a chance.  I have had no problems with this bench.  It is very sturdy and sturdy for the price.

0,"I'm a survivalist and outdoorsman and love to fish so this fishing vest is right up my alley. I cannot begin to tell you how much room for storage and equipment this gives you. It is amazingly adjustable and is more than comfortable for me(6'3"" 270 lbs) with room to expand, yet if I were 5'10"" and 170 lbs it would be just as comfortable because it literally is made for anyone of any size. That's the kind of stuff I love. Let me give you an idea of how much this can fit. I am able to take along with me in this vest a survival kit including emergency blanket, water purification tablets, two compasses, 50 feet of paracord, mid sized walkie talkie, fire starting materials, set of keys, wallet and spare hooks, line, sinkers and lures.  It doesn't weigh you down, you have multiple pockets, Velcro straps and areas to clip onto. This material is rip stop and tear proof, and incredibly breathable! Comfortable as can be and it looks great. I have seen some vests that look deplorable, this one is incredibly fashionable as is it practical. What I love most is that I don't have to carry an additional bag or rucksack when fishing any longer as this is more than capable of carrying everything I need. With a dry bag in tow I have everything covered. I was provided this item discounted in exchange for a thorough review. The seller asked for honesty even if it was non favorable. That shows integrity and you can be sure you are buying from a reputable and honest seller.  I can't see any outdoorsman not loving this vest. I'm pretty picky when it comes to outdoor equipment and I love it. I trust that you will as well and at this price for what you're getting you can grab a couple of them..."
0,"Has everything I need: -Knife blade -Scissors -Phillips & flat tip screw drivers -Tooth pick (I am always looking for a tooth pick. People with braces will also appreciate it). -Cool color (traditional red's nice, but kinda boring).  I like the other features as well: tweezers, awl/punch, can opener, and parcel hook which I use for pulling tent stakes.  Excellent quality, nice features, nice price. It's got enough tools to be useful in most situations, yet small enough to carry in larger pockets.  ************************************ UPDATE 4/6/15: Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:  -The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end). -The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver. -Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.  Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber."

1,"I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago. I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago's exciting night life. I found The Talbott Hotel's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for. The price sounded reasonable, so I booked a room. The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that Friday afternoon. After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. They blamed this on shortage of maids that day. They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. This disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again? Probably not."

People who know me, will tell you how much I despise cliffhangers. So glad you decided to release them close together. As much as I loved the first book, I can tell you without a doubt that I enjoyed this one so much more. Let me list the ways. 1. I received the answers to all of my unanswered questions in the first novel. 2. The player was finally tamed, and holy crap it was awesome. Once again the sex was smokin' hot. And not only that, we also got to see Xander's sweet and vulnerable sides. Love it! 3. Enjoyed the little bit of suspense you threw into the mix. Although, I kind of figured it all out before it was actually revealed, but I was still enthralled until the very end. 4. It ended with and HEA.

I need more of these, but I do think they are a bit pricey for being cases. A caution when stacking is that they aren't super secure when just clipped together.  If you're driving and only the bottom box is secured the top boxes may come off."

0,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.  As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.  Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.  Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.  I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2"

0,"I knew nothing about Tammy Faye Bakker prior to seeing this film and I was surprised not only at how fascinating her life has been, but also just how fascinating she is period.  The jovial tone of the documentary is really the key to the film for a couple of reasons.  First, it allows us to have fun at Tammy Faye's expense (and besides her make-up, there is still much about her that is worth poking fun at -- the archival footage of the Bakkers hosting a show while Tammy Faye was hooked on prescription drugs is the film's highlight), and her participation in the fun makes it easier for the audience to laugh along.  Secondly, to allow us to look back on her past hardships with so much humour, instead of bitterness, does give the impression that she is one hell of a survivor.  My impression of Tammy Faye before seeing the documentary had been cemented by the mainstream media, which has made her out to be a rich, spoiled and corrupt witch.  So you can imagine my shock as I realized that Tammy Faye had completely won me over by the end of the film.  My immediate reaction to this was that I had been manipulated and I complained that the directors must have felt too much affection for Tammy Faye since the audience was never exposed to the evil side of her character.  However, after considering the film a little more, I realized that Tammy Faye is likely to be too self-unaware and too much of an exhibitionist to actually hide the less pleasant aspects of her personality.  This is what makes her the perfect documentary subject.  Whether the camera is there or not, Tammy Faye's personality is as constant as her permanent eyelashes."

0,"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.  Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.  Would recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!"

0,"I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.  My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.  Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win."

0,"This is my second read by K'wan and once again I was not disappointed! Kwan draws you in with his colorful characters and doesn't let you go until the last page. Street Dreams is about guy name Rio from the projects who starts off being just nickel and dime dealer from around the way, but when he's approached by Prince, the king of the streets..Rio's lifestyle quickly starts to change for the good for him.  But when Prince's oldest son, Truck is released from prison all hell breaks loose out of jealousy.  I instantly fell in love with Trinity(Rio's girlfriend), Shamel(his longtime childhood friend), Sally(his Mom) and Cutty(another one of his friends).  Street Dreams is by far one of the BEST books I've read in a long time!  K'wan keeps you on the edge of your seat chapter after chapter and snatches your breath away at the very end!  Street Dreams is HIGHLY recommended for readers who love drama, suspense, action, love and edge of the seat writing all in one!

1,"Jamie Blanks' 2001 ""Valentine"" is a real standout.  The film is a turn-based action adventure.  There are a few twists, but the movie is very action-oriented.  The action sequences are well done.  Some of the special effects are very good.  The special effects are a bit too intense.  Overall, ""Valentine"" is a solid movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and adventure.I like this movie very much.  I have watched it about 1,000 times, and I am not sure how many times it has been viewed by other people.  This movie was a good introduction to my daily routine.  I had some problems with the writing, but I thought it was good.  It's a good movie for a young person to watch.  I have no problems with the sound.  I just wish they had used some audio or video capture techniques.  It was good to see some of the actors in the movie.  The acting was good, and the characters were believable"

0,"I ended up sending it back.  I saw several reviews for this knife that gave it rave reviews, but I just didn't care for the wave design.  If you don't want it to open with the wave, it was difficult to pull the knife out without the wave snagging something.  Also, it didn't seem very secure just pinching the tail to pull it out using the wave.  I have a Fox DART which has the karambit style ring on the tail which is VERY secure; however, the ring sticking up above your pocket when using the clip is pretty conspicuous.  I guess you would learn to deal with it if you need a knife to deploy that quickly.  I ended up buying the Delica 4 with the saber grind, and I LOVE it.  Plenty fast for my purposes, and no snags to cause it to open when I don't want it to."

1,"but just couldn't do it. For reference, I bought the size 11 in navy blue, the size 11 in red and the size 11 in black. The navy blue is a darker color and the black is a lighter color. I wore them for about an hour and still have no complaints. They are great for lounging around in the house and on the beach. They are very comfortable and look great. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. He is 5'10"", about 165lbs. He is 5'4"", 140lbs. He has had them for a couple months and they have been great. He said they are comfortable, but I would have given them 5 stars if I had not worn them. Very comfortable, it is a little narrow, but I have a very small chest. I have a large chest and it is tight, but not too tight. This is my second pair of this cute leggings. They are very comfortable and fit well. They are soft and comfortable. The color is exactly as I expected. Great, very comfy, I ordered size up as needed. I wear a 7 1/2 in skirts and these fit perfect!I had a little trouble finding a pair of Levi's that fit, but these were perfect. I love that they come with a zipper, but they are very cute."

0,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.  First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.  A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.  My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

0,"So, this Augmented Reality thing sounded kind of gimmicky to me, but I was still curious and hey, the photo on the puzzle is pretty. It took me about a week to finish the puzzle in between a million other things I had to do. Most of it wasn't too terribly difficult - the hardest part was definitely the trees along the bottom. Took me as much time to do that almost as the rest of the puzzle.  At any rate, I downloaded the app and followed the instructions and it is kind of neat how the picture turns into a snowy landscape. My husband said, ""Oh, that's cool!"" But it wasn't an out-of-this-world experience for me. :-) I'm not sure that it was worth all the effort of putting the puzzle together if your only reason was to use the AR app. I don't think I'd go buy more of the AR puzzles unless I just really, really liked the picture."
1,"Overall, I like this vacuum.  I have an old one that I used for a couple of years.  I have had it for a couple of months now and it works great.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would have made cleaning easier.  I also love the 2 filters that come with it.  I have a hard time getting the filter into the container when I have to use it to filter water.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after using it.  I have a hard time cleaning the water after it has been stored in a refrigerator or freezer.  I have a hard time getting it in the dishwasher.  I do like the color and the fact that it has a rubberized seal.  It is also a little heavier.  I don't have to worry about the metal being broken.  I like the fact that it has a plastic cover that makes cleaning easier.  I like the fact that it is a little bigger than my old vacuum.  I have been using it for several months now and it is doing a good job.  I am very happy with the purchase.Very nice and sturdy!

0,"I Was Looking For - 1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight  PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company. Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.  CONS 1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there. 2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access. 3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.  OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.  I will use the bag as a day travel purse in crowded cities. If you are not opening it much, It will work great as a day carry bag for sure."

0,"I vaguely recall reading some articles by Mr. Safire, but I've never read any of his books before.  Well, I shall certainly remedy that.  If Scandalmonger is any sign, William Safire might just be one of the most able writers in the US today. Seriously, it must have been six months since I've last enjoyed a novel as much as I have enjoyed this one.  Written with clear, powerful and well thought of prose (In the afterwords, Safire reveals some of the tricks that he used in order to convey the atmosphere without falling into the use of anarchonisms), this book is always thrilling and often witty, for those of us who enjoy subtle, sharp irony. You don't have to reach the appendixes in order to realise the width of Safire's knowledge of the topic.  Safire is clearly very well versed with the history of the period, and it shows.  Not a very descriptive writer, Safire clearly knows alot about the personality of each and evry character in the novel.  Writing with a Historian's dedicacy, even Safire's lies are rarely more than half truths. The Pacing and prose of Scandlemonger are perfect.  It is a page turner, very well written and planned.  Safire never lets his grip loose, and every word counts. The parallels between the US of the 1790s-1800s and the US of the 1990s-2000s are overwhelming, and surprisingly, you feel some appreciation to the history of journalism.  I think it is impossible to read Scandalmonger without thinking about Monica Lewinski, but the novel will still be every bit as good when Lewiski, like Sally Hemmins, will be left as no more than an ancedote in US history. I can not recommand Scandalmonger enough.  In each and every aspect it is a masterpiece of fiction.  In one word: TRIUMPH."

0,"The leg holes were a bit small for my 8mo who is big for his age (21lbs / 28 inches) in comparison to the body hole which is twice his size. The result is that baby was nervous wobbling back and forth in the beginning. Once we showed the baby to lean forward, he seemed to take it better and wasn't as scared. Making the leg holes even 1 inch bigger would be great, and make the body hole 4 inches smaller in circumference would balance this out better. For direct overhead shade, this shade stands up but wobbles. Perhaps an extra snap button loop towards the front and next to the existing ones would give it more stability. Overall, for the price, durability, and value. We are happy. Also nice to have something baby that is NOT so bulky while porting everything else around."

In the past, we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina, but chose to stay closer to home this year. The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived, even though we paid for an upgrade. We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after. Upon our return, nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume, it wasn't even checked as promised. We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice! The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming, the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it, the honor bar/fridge was gouged and dirty, too! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all....There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. Very disappointing to say the least. I have buyer's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds! We were compensated for our upgrade - $20.00 but given the price of parking, taxes, and etc. at this point I wouldn't recommend this Hyatt to anyone. My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility."

0,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.  There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.  Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.  I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.  UPDATE: November 2013: My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"

Guy Ritchie takes you on a wild ride through the madness and mayhem that begins with the a shady real estate deal and never lets up. This perfectly paced piece of action adventure stars some great actors, including Tom Wilkinson who delivers an awesome performance. Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director. I only wish he would make more movies."

It's about the same size as the one I was using at the time, but it's a bit bigger for him, so I will probably order a third.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

We got a very reasonable price for our stay (especially since we were a AAA member), and there was plenty of perks to utilize; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few. Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that, upon request, the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room. How cool is that! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area."

0,"The bad:  it is a pain to turn on and off with heavy gloves on.  The app is worthless and is incredibly difficult to get the app to recognize the unit even after it is connected in the bluetooth menu.  The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.  The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.  They are too bulky to fit in my jacket pocket for work (plus require spare batteries) so they don't really compete well for most applications."

0,"Streamlight's UltraStinger is really in a niche by itself.  Mag Light's rechargeables aren't as bright and SureFire's are much more expensive, so the UltraStringer is really made for someone desiring a quality light that won't break the bank. Some of the nice features of this light: It's very lightweight, very bright (75,000 candlepower), run time is very good for this much light output.  Well made, quality construction. Some of the cons about this light:  Plastic lens (seems only SureFire will give you a genuine Pyrex, glass lens these days) and the spot/flood range isn't really that much of a difference (Mag's spot/flood produces a SPOT or a FLOOD).  The Streamlight has a very coarse adjustment range, really being all the same style output, with very LITTLE difference in the SPOT / FLOOD.  This isn't as bad as it sounds as the light produced is a very good, pure white light, I'd just like to see more variation in the range, but I'm being picky here. One thing's for certain; this light is much better than Mag's rechargeable and a lesser light than SureFire's 8 or 9N rechargeable.  But, it's also half the price of the SureFire and 80% less than SureFire's 10-X.  So, I've got to give it 5 stars for being a great value, occupying a market not really served by either Mag or SureFire. If you're a contractor or home inspector, this light is THE value on the market in a bright, quality constructed rechargeable."
0,"Kill Bill Volume 1 is mesmerizing from the very first few seconds.  Simply one of the best films I have ever seen.  Startling real, not formulated, a real joy, and a very tongue in cheek tribute to all those wonderful Hong Kong, Japanese and American martial arts films of my youth.  Of all the very excellent believable performances I have to single out Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishi a part that Ms. Liu has captured to the fullest.  Part viscous, aloof, funny, autocratic, determined, cruel and viperous I only wish we could see more of this ""empress of the Yakuza"" as a future film series as she has really captured the essence of this woman, this assassin, this powerhouse.  In addition Uma Thurman is the glue that holds this film together, and what a job she does of it.  I can hardly wait for Volume 2 to come out in February.  In the meantime rush to the theatre and consume Volume 1."

While installing it, I found two things: 1) my existing (basic wire) antenna was dramatically improved by wiggling/adjusting where it connects to the stereo; 2) this Terk antenna created regular bursts of static which I found intolerable.

0,"Why tinker with a masterpiece? This original movie version of the stage play was remade twice for the screen and once for television and all of them are not just poor remakes, they are AWEFUL in comparison. The 1950's musical remake, ""The Opposite Sex"" fails in many ways. First, by turning it into a musical. Second, by casting June Allison in the lead. And third, by adding men to the cast. The latest remake from a few years ago fails by trying to modernize the storyline. The story works best when set in the 1930's pre-""women's lib"". This 1939 version is much more biting and satiracal, the actresses give their all for director George Cukor. As superb as Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Rosiland Russell are, for me, the stand-out performances were by the three older actresses, Mary Boland, Marjorie Main, and especially Lucile Watson."

0,"Amazing toy. Bought one for our 7 yr old niece and played around with it. Seems to be the hotness of 2013. But let's not lose our heads, here. It is merely a reconfigured Nerf Blaster. Instead of a trigger or a pump, you pretend to release a string. Aiming is more luck than skill. Comes with five whole darts.  If they really want to learn about archery, you'd be better served buying a simple 'starter' bow and arrow set for about the same price. Teaches them a skill AND not to shoot their friends! My dad taught me to shoot when I was young and it is still a fun and relaxing hobby for me. This will not teach them anything, but dang, it's fun!  Some advice on the price: -This retails for abouts twenty dollars. All my local retailers were sold out, and about two hours after purchasing it from Amazon the price here more than doubled. I see a lot of annoyed shoppers giving this one star over the price and that's bad form. You don't like the price, don't buy it. Don't mislead other shoppers about this great, fun product because the vender is gouging. Amazon isn't always the best price. I've seen a few 'hot' products sold for much cheaper locally (Target, WM, TrU) and while Amazon is great for most holiday shopping, in this case, at this moment, they aren't. ALWAYS remember to price check! -Don't be suckered into buying the 'girly' refills, the ones that match the colors of the bow. They cost more than twice the price of the regular orange ones! (Now THIS is some sexist gouging!) Kids don't care what color their ammo is and not everything girls touch needs to be pink. Save some money and pick up a pack of standard Nerf refills."

0,"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.  The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.  My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.  Now to the sellers service: My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.  Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.  Me: Pictures sent  Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?  Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.  Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.  Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.  Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers."

I enjoyed the way each of the Sparrow women made a contribution to their bloodline.

I would definitely recommend this book to my friends."
1,"I recommend fish oil treatment for both the dogs and cats.  If you have a pet who is prone to allergies, this may be a good product.  If you are looking to avoid choking on pet food, try this.  I have tried it on my cats and no one seems to have a problem. I have had to use a second bag of this product. I just put it on the floor and it is on my floor and it smells very good.  I have also tried other products, but this one has been on my floor for a few months and has not been choking. I have used it on my dogs and my cats. I am very happy with this product and would recommend to anyone.This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be.  He is very active and has not gotten into the crate and there is no pain or discomfort in his neck.

0,"I've read this novel twice now, and I can see myself reading it again at some point, thanks in part to prose such as, ""Mortimer favored loud ties, liked his food to the point of fussiness, and bowed and scraped in front of clients in a way that gave the Major his only opportunity, outside of the Sunday Times crossword, to use the word 'oleaginous.'"" There are no huge, cliffhanging surprises here, just very good writing and characters that draw you along and make you wish for the story to never end. I hope Helen Simonson is busy giving us another such well written novel."

0,"As an update to my original review back in 2013: I began having problems with this about 8 months after I purchased it. It crashed 3 times over a matter of two years. I'm uncertain if it was caused by the demand from FSX but I do know something was notably wrong. To be fair, I may just have received a faulty piece of hardware. Nonetheless, after the third nose-dive; out it came. I didn't care about warranties at that point and I am thankful that my OS was not on it. Sadly, it was the worst hard drive that I ever had. I replaced it with a 250 GB SSD which has been magnificent. My current opinion is that Solid State is the only way to go."

The paint is a bit messy.  I don't know how long the kids will be able to paint the toys, but the plastic is pretty good for how it's made.  The pieces are pretty sturdy, and the kids seem to like that the pieces are made from recycled materials.  It's not hard plastic, but it is not sturdy enough to be a choking hazard.  I would say this is a good toy for the kids, and would recommend it to anyone.This is a great set of accessories for your daughter to use when she's in her first year.

These are definitely a new favorite. The dogs like the flavor and I like them for two more reasons.  One is that they are soft, so my (greedy) labs don't choke on them.  The second reason is that you can break them into smaller pieces for training sessions and they don't just turn into crumbs like some treats do.  They are perfect for this.  I will be buying more of these! MMMMMMMM!"

I finally put 2 and 2 together and came back to Amazon to read all the 1 Star reviews for this product and could not believe what I was reading. How can a product this dangerous be sold as an anti-fog solution that you put next to your eyes? I threw the product away and my eyes have fortunately cleared up.

The light weight of this dolly was key for me--the last thing I needed was additional weight while transporting boxes down the steps. I also like the versatility of this item--it can shift to a platform truck, which will come in handy when I want to transport trash/recycle bins at my new house. I'm disabled so the ease of use is perfect for my needs. When my nephew saw this dolly, he loved it. So I bought one for him to use when he transports his wares to comic/anime conventions. He can't stop praising its compactness and versatility."

The stroller itself is nicely designed and our cavalier King Charles is looking forward to going for a  ride in the park! Update: I give this stroller a 5star now, as after contacting the company direct as to the tire (we purchased another bike pump from a bike shop). They sent us out a new tire that fits the rim perfectly and now rolls as it should.  We needed this as our little guy has hip issues at only 1yr and needs help walking .. this works great and he Loves it after he's done with his all...

This would be a great option if you were traveling and needed something easy to hide or just take up as little space as possible. This is a very slim style card wallet and still as the internal slot for some cash as well. I like having both options this company offers for that reason. OPTIONS!

By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare.

Forney promises that this will do just as well...... my best guess based upon previous Forney products used is that it will be equal, or very likely,.... a bit better than the expensive stuff.  However that may be, I do NOT know that for sure yet.  I do not need it it right now, and have no jobs in the immediate future to do so.  Later on, if I find it is a lot better, I will find and update this posting.  I do hope it helps someone out there who is fearful of it failing.

Over the past 3 months, I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time; problems every time. From the wrong food with room service, to room keys that dont work, unrefreshed bath towels, forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service, unclean ice bucket overnight, forgotten room cleaning, inability to connect to the Internet....I'm too tired to keep writing all the problems. For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel, I expect more. Finally, their team is certainly not trained in customer service. The front desk teams have attitudes, and Aria's hostesses think they are something else. I'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon, but I would never go back if I had a choice. The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding."

0,"We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip. I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite, then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. Well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. The room was dirty. When we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. If you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer, I guess some may find this place tolerable. But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral. The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to The James and had a great experience). I couldn't be paid to stay here again. I'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience."

I trapped it under a glass (see the attached pictures) and called the front desk. The housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach. Absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem, failing to follow through on promises they made to me. Setting aside the bug problem, I caution that the windows are quite thin. We could hear a lot of the street noise, which made for a hard night's sleep, not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms. For $400 a night after tax, I strongly encourage you to check for alternatives."

So... enter our new tank (and new fish, sadly our old betta met an unfortunate - not tank related - end)...  We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.  There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.  Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough."

Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to install any drivers.  It just plain works.    What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).  Finally, if you using this for Plex note: only the primary plex account can access the program guide to watch TV, none of the other users you've created can access them."

0,"So, the original charger lasted about 3 years without a problem, then suddenly had a short at the plug end.  I bought this one to replace it.  The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.  I bought a NEW MOTOROLA charger, and have used it twice now, no issues with the plug and no shorting out.  So I recommend you save yourself my pain, and buy the Motorola OEM Charger (also on Amazon) for $9 vs. the $6.75 that this thing cost."
1,But I couldn't stop watching.  I kept hoping the show would end.  It didn't.  It just didn't.  The characters and the story were just so short.

I will buy this show.

1,"I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. While higher priced, the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. Granted the hotel itself is beautiful, but looks can be deceiving. The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architect) had amazing food, so that was a plus, but the service was awful. I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water! My remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. The hotel must've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. I called twice for more fresh towels. If I wanted this type of experience, I'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. Same experience, less money!"

0,"After watching the Sharpe series on video I decided to read them in print.  Bernard Cornwell wrote this book first, although chronologically it is not the first in the life of Richard Sharpe.  What a great story!  It has all the elements of a great adventure.  This book is a page-turner from the very beginning.  This is a great book for the history buff - or anyone who loves an adventure.  One of the things I like about Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books is that they are great stand alone stories and you don't feel that you need to read the entire series in a particular order to enjoy them.  I have bought several copies of Sharpe's Eagle and given them as presents to those hard-to-buy-for men on my shopping lists."

I guess in the old days you just held your taco shell while mama filled it and you held it in your hand, no plate or anything to worry about, not even the dirt floor, the dog cleaned that. But we don't do it that way. We put more than tacos and more than one at a time, so we lose the contents before we get to them. I like these and the service was great. I suppose the price might have been lower for what they are, but they are worth even more to me in peace of mind."

I'm 5'6"" and they're a bit tight on me, but they're not too tight either.  They're super cute!I bought these for my wife and she loves them. They are a little too big for her to wear on her work day, but she does a lot of walking and is very active. She's also had a few pairs of these before and the ones she tried were too small. She said they were just too small, but that was not true. She also thought the fit was a little tight for her. She said that the heel part of the boots was very soft, but they were so tight that she was able to walk on them. She is a size 11 and these boots fit her perfectly. I would definitely recommend these boots!I was worried that this would be a little bigger than I was expecting, but it fits perfectly.  The color is a little different from the picture, but it's still pretty beautiful and I love it.  The quality is nice too, and I would definitely buy more!Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.

It's a little pricey for a flashlight but I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I have a few of these in the house and they are a little heavier than I expected.  This one is a little heavier and I like it better than the other ones.  I have them on my garage door opener.  I love that they are bright and small.  I will be buying more of these.  The one I have is great.  I am very happy with it.  I have to say it's not bright for my needs.

0,"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.  I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.  When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.  I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.  There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.  If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.  Very recommended.  Go for it."

I liked that it was easy enough for her to build by herself, though she did need a bit of adult assistance to tighten some of the screws. The robot is very cute and it works perfectly. I have since bought her a few other 4M robots as Christmas gifts (which she has not opened yet) because she had so much fun building this one."

I fully enjoyed my time with A VERY SIMPLE CRIME.  The author doesn't insert extra words that do nothing to move the story forward and I appreciated his lean style.  At times, it seemed like there were two different writing styles and both engaged and held me.  Really interesting.  A VERY SIMPLE CRIME is a fast and satisfying read.  Grant Jenkins has my interest and I hope to have his next book in my hands soon."
1,"Great idea but total fail. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the blades to fit, but they're okay. I'm not sure how it's possible to get the blades to fit on a car. I'm not sure how the blade is supposed to fit on the car, but the blade is on the car so I'm not sure. This is not a problem if you're going to use a car, so if you want to get the blades to fit, you will. This is a small knife, and a great addition to any tool box. A couple of reviewers have stated that the blade is on the car, but this isn't a problem. It's a nice blade for an affordable tool box."

He loves adding other characters/toys (such as planes and construction vehicles) to the kit, and wants to get a mommy and daddy for the green dragon--so it's as great for creative play as my husband and I both remember from our childhoods. We also felt the quality of the plastic and construction was up to par with what we remember (hard to find these days). It was relatively easy to put together, and seems quite sturdy. I was surprised to see my kid did manage to pull one section apart since it seems really tightly put together once everything popped into place; but that's probably what helps to make it durable and resistant to breaking around younger kids too. Definitely looking forward to adding onto the collection over the next few years!"

There is no way you can attach a leash to the leash, and it is not clear how it will be attached.  The dog has no trouble with the leash.

1,saw this in the theater...really enjoyed it.  Not too many people who have seen this movie would agree that it is a great story.  The acting was superb.

0,"This is a well written book and the author skillfully plays with the reader's emotions.  In fact, you may experience quite a range of emotion -- all except for joy.  This is nothing joyful in this story.  There are times of less pain but there is always pain.  Getting to know the heroine is worth reading the book for even though it is not an easy book to read.  The hero, in my opinion, is an arrogant know-it-all that I could not accept for the majority of the story.  I liked him marginally better by the end. That said, if you can get through the Leningrad seige section, you may enjoy the rest of the book."

I have read several of her books and will continue to read more of them. I am looking forward to reading her other books.

1,"I bought my son's jeep and it was the best. I will keep my son's and he will be so happy. The bed is solid and is comfortable. It does take a little getting used to it but it will be fine. I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"" for my family's frozen pizza. I love the fact that it is a non stick surface. I just put it on top of the stove and it works great! It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food. The base is made of solid plastic so it does not stick to the stove. I put it on top of the stove and it works great. It is easy to clean and holds a lot of food. It looks great in my kitchen. It's also a good size for a small kitchen. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food. I love it. Works great. Easy to use. I used this for a few days and I am very happy with the results. I have been using this product for about 4 months now and it is doing the job. It is not heavy, it is easy to install and I can use it on my bed."
0,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened. About as much validity is attached to the author's work as that of Von Daniken."

0,"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.  I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.  It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.  I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.  I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.  It's a very quiet fountain.  You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound.  I don't unplug it at night.  It runs 24/7."

0,"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.  The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.  The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.  The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.  The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.  If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough."

0,"These booties have come in handy as I've had electricians and plumbers doing some work on the house. I have light colored floors that show dirt easily so these kept the floor clean. The workmen were surprised I had these booties but they wound up liking them so much that they took the them for future jobs.  The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.  The quality is good. They have light treads though not sure if they make much of a difference in grip.  The only thing is that you have to get over your initial embarrassment at asking people to put them on. Still, it's better than asking folks to take their shoes off."
0,"After staying at the Sheraton Royal Orchid Hotel in Bangkok, I was expecting a similar experience at the Chicago Sheraton. I had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. For the past 3 years I stayed at the Palmer House in the Loop, but thought I'd try a more modern hotel. PROS - location by the Chicago River, two blocks from Michigan Avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes, crepes and french toast CONS - check-in assigned me to a city view room when I had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good, but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive: bathtub-shower combination; worn plumbing fixtures; only 2 sets of towels provided - guest room was small: only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to nearest L-station - concierge couldn't explain how to get to the Mercury Theatre, nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get Starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the Link Cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the Link Cafe where boarding passes can be printed"

0,"Both my dogs loved this treat! One of my dogs devoured this whole treat in about two minutes. My other dog savored it for a bit longer, but still didn't last quite as long as expected. One thing is for sure, they both definitely enjoyed it. One thing that is a bit confusing about this treat is that a third of them are corn, and corn is a filler that your supposed to avoid when looking for a dog treats/food. Carrots and celery are excellent for dogs, but corn is just a filler with no actual nutrients. I suppose because it it just that- a treat- that it doesn't really matter. The texture and consistency of this treat is about in the middle of a biscuit and a bone. Doesn't keep them busy very long like a rawhide, but it is more than just a one, two crunch of a typical dog biscuit like a milk bone. I think it is a pretty good treat overall, but it is quite pricey considering all of the other longer-lasting and healthier treats out there. I gave it 4 stars based on the treat itself, but if you factor in the price I would probably drop it down to about 2 1/2 stars."

Putting it together was a breeze. However I did find that the wrap around strap does not fit all seats. I have a Ford Escape of which I can attach the wrap around strap but my Jeep Grand Cherokee I cannot as the seat is much wider. But I found the seat is perfectly functional with the other two straps and still very safe.
0,"I had heard about 24 for a long time before ever seeing it.  I finally saw an episode a few weeks ago and thought it was quite good.  I ended up deciding to watch the first season.  It was certainly a highly entertaining show with no end to the action.  It contains murder, espionage, terrorism, traitors, kidnapping and a presidential assassination plot.  And that is all in one day.  The concept of the show is that each episode represents one hour of a day in real time.  The hero, federal anti terrorist agent Jack Bauer, encounters more action in two hours than any 50 average people do in their entire lives.  Although some of the events are certainly implausible in the time frames allotted, it is great entertainment.  Although I am not much of a TV watcher, I may just become one for this show.  I recommend it."

Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be.

Use an Exacto knife to knick the outer sheath of insulation and then it peals back easily.  The stakes are thin aluminum and they won't last long in the ground.

I would highly recommend this collar to any dog owner.This is a great product!  We have a great dog who is on a gluten free diet and this helps her to get her teeth cleaned and remove plaque from her mouth.  I was able to find this on Amazon for $30.  My vet said it was the best on the market and I was really impressed.  I used this product on a very small dog and she has been getting very good results.  She is a big chewer so it is important to keep her food on hand, which is important to me as she is a chewer.

0,"I loved Desiree Holt's book, Joy Ride.  As a matter of fact, I can honestly say that Joy Ride turned me into a Rock Band Romance Junky.  With that in mind, I'm here to tell you that Aftershock, the sequel to Joy Ride, has more than satisfied my appetite for this sub-genre of romance.  Aftershock is a truly amazing read.  In my opinion this story is even better than Joy Ride.  You do get to catch up on what's happening with the hero and heroine of Joy Ride, Marc and Emma, as well as getting to know the other members of the band Lightnin' a bit better.  But you also get to meet Sydney Alexander, newly named promotions agent for the happening, new-on-the-scene band Lightnin' who is hot, sexy yet somewhat troubled by some past life experiences and the nasty, bitter aunt who raised her after the death of her parents.  You get to learn more about Rick Trajean, leader of the band, Lightnin' while savoring all the sweet, sexy details of how Syd and Rick fall for each other.  Then hold on to your hats because things get a little wild when the nasty villain enters the picture.  Let me tell you.  Desiree Holt writes THE BEST villains and she sure doesn't disappoint in this story.  You are going to love hating this villain.  Desiree Holt is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I love her writing style.  Her characters are always so real.  The story line is always sure, succinct and sure to grab your attention.  All this is true in Aftershock but she goes beyond the usual.  I felt like I was really backstage listening to Lightnin' perform during the concert and interacting with everyone after the concert while reading this book. I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure.  Aftershock is most definitely an Off-the-Charts #1 winner!"

Anthony Robbins, noted motivational/inspirational/self-help speaker and author has said many times, ""Success Leaves Clues!""

This book takes you from the first investment sale to investing in many sales and clearly demonstrates how to avoid the pitfalls and going it alone mentality (no one can do it better than I can).

1,"I bought two of these and both work fine. I will keep one for the other one. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, but it is not as bright as the old one. I have to use a larger diameter bulb, which is a lot better. It has more of a fluorescent look, but I like the look more. I like that the bulb is longer than the old one, which is nice. I use the same bulb twice a day, and use it daily. It is more of a ""screwdriver"" type of light. The reason I like this bulb is because it has a longer diameter, which makes it easier to carry around. Also, the light is pretty bright, so I'm happy with the light. I don't really like the color of the bulb, but it is pretty cool. I bought a couple of these for my son's bedroom. He loves it. He loves the way it lights up his room. I'm very happy with the size of this light."

The writing was nice, and I found myself in the middle of the story. This was an excellent read.I loved this book. I have read the book 3 times and have loved it. I've also read the other books in the series and enjoyed them all. The story was interesting and well written. The characters were very believable. I'm not sure if I liked the ending, but I was just pleased that it went down well.I like that the story is not over. I don't know how you can ruin a book and keep it from becoming a success.

Hotel Sofitel is right in the heart of the action, allowing my friends and I to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for. The room was comfy, with two queen mattresses, down stuffed duvets and chic decor. The bar downstairs was a bit pricey, but made up for it by being comfortable, sleek, and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. One night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the Cafe des Architectes, which had an amazing array of choices, mostly of the French persuasion. I would definitely book here again!"

I am giving this book 5 stars, the characters were very developed and I felt like I could easily visualize them and they weren't unrealistic. The story itself is good with lots of turns and I was left guessing MANY times. This was not a predictable mystery which I really liked and which made me keep wanting to read to know what happened. I felt it did have a couple dry parts or parts that SEEMED repetitive, but those parts were quickly redeemed. I would highly recommend this book."

0,"You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.  Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife."

0,"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.  The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.  I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy! I think they work very well for the price, and for being just a standard filter cartridge. They're nothing fancy, but I'm satisfied with how they work. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends."

0,"This was a beautifully crafted movie, gritty, suspenseful, well written and wonderfully acted. It told a nice detective yarn with real characters, well developed characters. There was enough grime and blood to be titillating but not in my opinion over the top. The pacing was just right; It flowed beautifully right down to the wonderfully done pull at the close of the last scene. It was almost really good. But the script pulled me out of it too many times. The dialog occasionally felt like it had been pulled right out of a novel without nearly enough of the back story you would find in the novel to justify it. I imagine it would feel okay to someone who had read the novel but in the movie it was sometimes insufficient to suspend belief. That being said I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. I would watch another with this character."

They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.  Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.  Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.  Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.  Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.  This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other."

His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.  Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!  And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...  Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.  As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""

Attaching the round thing to the top was, however, impossible because the two holes were too close together. That's why I docked it one star.

0,"This doorbell easily installed on my chain link gate with the included sticky pad.  I placed the ringer on a plastic board and fastened the board against the fence.  Most of the rings are digital music.  There are eight ""ring"" options on this doorbell which was sufficient for our needs.  The second loudest setting can be heard down the hallway through a closed door.  Waterproofing is as advertised. I frequently water my bushes with the gate open, and the ringer gets drenched.  It's also held up well in the southern California sun, with the battery lasting over 8 months already.  You will have to unscrew the circuit board to get to the battery, which is going to be a pain when the battery needs replacement. Pay a little more to get the SadoTech. The cheaper models don't last."

0,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.  And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.  Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.  All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it."

0,"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.  I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.  The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.  An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."

0,"What a delightful short story this is! Just what I needed - a feel good, romantic, Christmas story.  The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)  This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.  Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?  The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.  The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.  My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?  All in all a great short read which left me with a huge smile on my face when I finished it."

1,"I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown, and found it lacking in the quality of their service. The rooms are nice and well furnished, but the service lacks in some areas. Some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access, cardio-fitness and indoor pool, grocery shopping service and coffee, tea, hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby's 24 hour convenience shop. However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times, the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned. The grocery shopping service was alright, although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality. Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5, I would give it a 3 at best."

I only had one hole that had poor pre-drilling, so compared to some of the other reviewers, I felt lucky. After the 2 1/2 hour construction, it seems like it will be a nice dollhouse. It seems good and sturdy. The ramp for the garage will likely fall off regularly because of the way it attaches, but its not really a essential element anyway.  Update 3 months later... I am leaving the three star rating.  The garage door ramp has never fallen off like I expected that it would, it doesn't attach very strongly, but the house doesn't get moved around all that much either. My son loves this house, and its played with daily. No amount of adjustments ever made our elevator work smoothly. It got stuck all the time, and I removed it entirely. It was bulky, awkward, and impossible for my independent 2 1/2 year to operate on his own.

We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.  The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.

0,"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...  In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.  In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change."

0,"Worth every penny.  This product will pay for it's self many times over.  Just the cost of going to the range, ammo and time.  Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.

0,"I've recently upgraded my marker to the Q Loader, after doing something searching around I found out that the NXe harness is the best to hold extra Q Pods so I went ahead and bought this. The pockets on this harness is really well made, my Q Pods can slide in and out with no problem yet when they are inside it's a really good fit so even when I wear this upside down for quicker release they still won't fall out while running in the woods. I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future. The velcro on the front is of very good quality, the contact surface area is big enough and I never have to worry about it falling off. I do, however, wish it was regular camo instead of digital, would match my shirt better but that's a minor hitch, wasn't described fully on the page but not really a big deal to me.

0,"If you have ever been to a bull riding event or just watched an event on the t.v. , you may of heard the name , Lane Frost .

In my opinion-this film only lacks one thing - needed to delve a little deeper in his ability . (More than likely)-the film makers wanted to make this more of a love story (to appeal to a bigger audience) . Just seems that way ,because ,there was a lot more to Lane . -- So you pretty much don't have to know anything about the rodeo or bull riding .

0,These daubers are pretty bad. I am an avid bingo player and go weekly. They sell daubers at the place I go to but they are expensive there. I was hoping by buying in bulk I would be saving money but it was a waste. First off the lid always takes the whole end of the dauber off so it's an explosion of ink waiting to happen. After you unscrew the lid you have to take the lid and push down on the ink pad to get it to click back in. Also the colors are more like paint so lavander  you can't even see the numbers behind. These things are crappy. I've ended up with a stained shirt from ink exploding and numerous ones I can't even use!

0,"I have no doubt that if I had no life outside of reading, I would've finished this book in a day. With my schedule, it took 4 days, and I truly enjoyed it!  You have to love a book that leaves you smiling as you read the last lines of the book and then sends you to the internet immediately to buy book 2. Charley Davidson is a ""grim reaper"", but not in the traditional sense that we all know. She is a portal through which those who didn't immediately cross over can use to get where they're supposed to go - presumably Heaven. The dead see her as this bright light, which they are usually drawn to, and she sometimes has to help them with their unfinished business before they are ready to cross over. She is also a very witty, sarcastic Private Investigator, and she's very good at it, with the help that she receives from some of the dearly departed. Oh, and there's this supernatural being that comes to her in the night in her dreams and has his way with her, and she's pretty happy about it. While I'm not one who is drawn to those lusty, cliche romance novels, I do love paranormal fiction and suspense, so this book fit the bill. Add to that, Charley's sarcastic sense of humor, which I am all over, and this made for a very quick, enjoyable read. The book is peppered throughout with little sarcastic one-liners, some of which had me laughing out loud and feeling silly, since my family had no idea what was so funny. Some reviewers commented that they were excessive, and maybe so, but not to the point where it might have taken away from my enjoyment of the book. If you have similar tastes, I highly recommend this book. If you're a bit on the prudish side, maybe not so much."

He has 3 large Breyer horses that fit perfectly in the stalls and he loves to play with his ""baby"" horses in the fenced in yard.  However, the prongs that hold the stall doors in place break VERY easily - 2 of 6 are down for the count within the first month. One broke through play - granted, he is a 3 year old boy and is not exactly ""gentle"" with his toys - but the other broke during assembly.  It was easy to put this barn together so there was minimal force applied.  I contacted Breyer for some replacement doors, but was informed that they do not have a parts department.  My son probably hasn't even noticed that the doors are missing so I didn't press the issue, but it's till annoying.  But again, cute barn, gender neutral, and I would buy it again, considering the price."
1,"During my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago,Illinois, at one of their Deluxe suites. Unfortunately, and I think I speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. When one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. First of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. Second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. For people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. For these, as well as other similar reasons, I would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations."

The best part of the double X is that it allows the jaws to open wide while the shank stays relatively thin, which is key for areas you will be using this plier (restricted access).  I hate sloppy pliers. I feel that this plier has a low level of slop in the joints. Which is impressive considering that it has twice as many joints as a conventional plier.  Apex tool group makes these and sells them under both Gearwrench and Crescent brands.

It showcases Buddy's technique across a full spectrum of sets, including brushwork on ""Brushstokes"".  One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) that has one of Buddy's classic solos.  This sequence alone makes the DVD worth getting. An added bonus is the included soundtrack on CD that comes with the DVD.  For the drummer wanting to learn a few tricks this is one of the best viedos of Buddy because there is ample camera exposure on his playing.  It's one thing to listen, but when you can see and listen it's a powerful combination for learning technique - and this video does just that.  Tracks include Hookin' It, Brush Strokes, If They Could See Me Now, Good News, West Side Story Medley, Carioca, Time Check, Green Dolphin Street.  If you are a Buddy Rich fan I also recommend getting the CD ""Buddy Rich Collection"" ASIN B00000DB1H, which is a remake of a 2-record set circa 1971."

1,"Reading this book is like reading an academic biography, which is a boring book. I am not a major fan of the book. The book is written as if it were a biography, but it is a detailed account of the life of a young man. This is a very good book. I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending."

The price was pretty reasonable, too. I'll definitely be back."

1,"One Con that's acceptable enough, and not too bad, is that it's a little hard to put on.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic strips to get it to work properly.  It's not a huge deal, but it is very annoying to put on.  I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.  The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.  I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a more compact bike.  It's a nice bike, but it's not a great one.  It will work fine for me, but I wouldn't recommend it.  It comes with a nice cover and"

The scene where the dog falls in love with a girl is really bad. There was no real love story. And then there was the scene where the girl's dog goes out to dinner with a girl. There was no romance or even a sex scene. There was a scene where a guy throws a man in the face. The scene where a guy breaks into the house, and then he's shot by the police is really bad.

0,"Nice poly bottle, nice filter attachments, and nice top cap with handle.  The only down side is the filter attachments are more like snap on and not screw on so in the long run the snap on might not stay on after it wears out.  Another down side is the top cap, it's more like a hard plastic so if you happen to drop it, the handle loop might break off or the whole top cap might break.  They should of used a softer plastic for the top cap, IMHO. Good for gym, yoga, gardening, but not for rock climbing, HD backpacking, or HC field use."

One thing I really appreciate is that even though it is a part of a series, it very easily stands on its own.  I don't feel the need to read additional books in the series, but I probably will."

If you enjoy details about homocides and like to,stay on the edge of your seat, this is the book for you.  Karen can spin a story that makes the reader want to read more and more - not wanting it to end. In this debut novel, Karen demonstrates her ability to weave a huge web that eventually comes back,together in synchronicity. The characters show their emotions and are extremely protective of their own.  Great action with just the right amount of human and compassion."

He also likes chewing the bottom mat.  It has held up very well, and I expect it to last quite awhile longer.  It is pretty small, so if you have a larger parrot, think again about buying this.  I also have a Green Cheek Conure and she is small enough to play with this too."

0,"I just had a conference there. They have bed bugs--I have all these bug bites and it itches like hell. Food wise, we had chicken BOTH times for lunch (maybe my company was saving some $) but they should at least prepare them differently. It looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying 'bed' upon which it is served. For dinner, we had filet mignon and crab cake. Sounds good right? Wrong! The filet mignon seems to be 1/2 the thickness of what I have seen and it was tough. I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? Also, the crab cakes was a bit too salty. Finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking. In asking my co-worker, most seem to be blase about the food. However, some seem to like the burger (which they went to substitute) at the Palms, which is a restaurant inside the hotel, just off the lobby. On the positive note, the dessert for dinner was good. Otherwise, I'd recommend another hotel. In the meantime, when I got home, I make sure to bring EVERYTHING straight to the washer/dryer to disinfect (even strip down). But, damn, I'm still itchin'"
0,I got this through vine but it is not something I would purchase.  My wife said she saw it at Target for $40.  This is not worth that price in my opinion.  It looks cool.  The different hats make Elmo say different things which adds new flavor to a toy that really wouldn't keep my kids attention.  They were excited to get it in the mail.  My 3 year old was done with it in less than an hour.  Our 15 month old occasionally drags it around but really doesn't play with it.  It is shedding and was doing so right from the time we got it.  I keep finding little red threads from the toy on our living room floor.  It has an on off switch which took me a while to realize but that was my fault.  Overall it is just OK.  I like elmo but honestly he is just going to sit here and collect dust.

Younger ones will need help/guidance but that's not unusual with the larger K'NEX coaster building kits.  This was a nice challenge for our more experienced builders but they'd played with a larger set in their ""ACE"" class at school and knew a bit of what to expect.  Once built they had to make the usual adjustments needed for many of these coaster builds (they had to do this at school as well) but once those were made they had great fun running the coaster around the track.  They're already talking about what modifications they'd like to make and designing alternate track layouts.  Highly recommended."

0,"This skirt is TINY & TIGHT. I'm talking SKIN-tight. For reference I'm 5'7 and 175 lbs I usually wear a size 10. I originally ordered a size XL (which according to the manufacturer is a size 14 - 16, which is WAY bigger than I ever wear). It was STILL TOO SMALL and insanely TIGHT. I ordered an XXL (which apparently is a size 18-20!!!!!) It's a bit looser around the waist, but still pretty tight the rest of the way down. Honestly - and surprisingly - this skirt is really probably most flattering on a smaller sized body - guess they don't call it a pencil skirt for no reason. I do think it's extremely cute though, despite it not being the best fit.  Two other things: you can absolutely see a panty-line. You can't see through all the way to the undies, but the line is quite obviously there.  Second, I ordered the ""coral"" color, which looks neon pink in the pictures, I was pleasantly surprised to find out when it arrived that it's actually not neon pink, but a very pretty baby-pink color. So, I have no idea what the actual ""pink"" shade looks like, since the coral color is actually a very pretty, light shade of pink...."

It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a sleeping bag. It is very light and you can put it in the back of your car or in your car seat. It's also very warm and easy to use. The hammock is made of sturdy material and is durable. We are not sure if it is a perfect hammock but it is a great hammock. We have a 5 year old and this is the perfect hammock for him. We are getting another hammock!The belt does not seem to be very strong, and I would not recommend it for anything more than a casual swimmer.

Then I just started wearing them all the time. Just used them in 13 degree weather with a few inches of snow with no socks. Worked great. They look nice and seem to hold up against the snow and salt here in the north east of the US.  I'll probably buy another pair to use when I""m out because I hate shoe laces.  They must use some kind of alien technology to keep your feet warm. There is no way humans created open, no lace shoes I can wear without socks in the snow and be warm. I'm waiting for the history channel to do a piece on these to explain it."

0,"Installed it on my Mitsubishi Outlander with Pioneer AVIC Z140BH head unit. Image quality is great at night or day. Doesn't cause the image to blow out when a car is driving behind you with their headlights on. Nice feature to allows ""tow view"" when using it with the Pioneer GPS Mode. Allows you to see your trailer etc while you drive.  CONS: - Doesn't offer backup guide overlay like other cameras (dont know how useful it is, but would be nice to have the option) - Doesn't offer multiple view angles like the Alpine units - The curve of the lens seems to let water drops build up more when it gets wet which blocks and blurs the image. My camera is installed in the OEM hole that is drilled under the tailgate bar so its more protected and concealed, but I'm sure not all cars have this so the camera would be more exposed to the elements."

0,A beautifully written book about a much maligned character who I always knew was so much deeper than he first appears. The way Lindsay has woven the threads we have only glimpsed in the past is a tribute to her skill and heart. Her new heroine is more than a match for him and their relationship reminds me so much of Ridge and Sardelle in its depth. I fervently hope that she will continue to write about them in the future as I am loathe to have this world and these stories end.

When a caller asks advice about her love life, Paris tells her to drop her loser boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Paris's normal callers.

This is the start of an incoherent story involving an old flame of Paris, whose son is involved with a sex club website that the abducted girl's father runs.

The only thing that I don't like is that the pieces have a ""turn"" sound and that it's difficult to turn in the direction you want it to go.

0,"This is the best book I've read in 2017 -- funny, sad, entertaining, totally satisfying, At the end (a denouement I never expected), I wanted to turn back and read it again to watch for the preparation and clues Towles had scattered throughout.  What's to be said about a book in which the protagonist (a Former Person to the Bolsheviks, Count Rostov to his friends) is under house arrest in a Moscow hotel for 40 years, Nikita Khrushchev plays a very small part, and New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury's overcoat is crucial to the way it all works out?  But the plot isn't the best part -- it is Towles' light-hearted prose style. Though he doesn't let the reader forget the horrors that were occurring outside -- massive starvation, five-year plans that didn't work, World War II -- what is important here is one man's mastery of his circumstances."

0,"Well, when I first got it I thought I could just run to the gym once the battery was activated. Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO. I did want something a little simpler for life."

This was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later Room was very clean as was the bathroom. With 4 women we needed extra towels, they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered. Room was also quiet, construction going on behind us and we never heard anything. Beds comfy and so were the quilts... Good location for Michigan Ave. All in all a wonderful stay. Would return."
0,"I don't know why I never thought of this before!  How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.  It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!  Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."

0,"The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel. The carpet was exceptionally worn, wallpaper peeling, bathroom grout dingy. The place felt like it hadn't been redecorated in 30 years. On top of that, the windows would not open (not unusual for a hig-rise hotel), and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work, I have no idea (they said 'radient cooling' whatever that is), but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation. We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated. So much for privacy. I can't comment on the food, because we ate out at every chance. Chicago has some fantastic food! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location, near the waterfront and millenium park, shopping and dining. The conference facilities were average, but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent. I will never stay in this hotel again, especially for the price, because of the poor room quality."
0,"This hotel cannot be beat for location, price, & atmosphere. The location is ideal, at the corner of State & Kinzie. There are fantastic restaurants & bars all around, including House of Blues & Harry Caray's. We stayed in a 'Corner King' room. The room was amazing. Two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. Even just being on the 5th floor, we had great views of the surrounding area. The decor and amenities are unmatched. The decor is very clean & simple but luxurious. The hotel is easy to miss from street level, but shouldn't be. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around River North, State Street shopping, or Clark Street nightlife. Even if you'll be on the Mag Mile, this is a short cab ride away. We've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice!"

The sound is great, and it's been in the trunk for about a month.  I'm very happy with the TV.  I have a portable player, a tablet, and a DVD player so I'm very happy with this TV.  I can't tell you how much better it is than the 50"" TV.  I've been using it for about a month now and it sounds great.  I'm very happy with the sound quality.  The sound is fantastic.  The TV is on the ceiling and I can hear the birds and the birds are in the background.  I've had no problems with the sound.  It's very clear and I'm very happy with it.

0,"Is this a great novel, or just a great read? That's the question I ask myself before writing this review.  Right now, I can't answer the question.  For me, only time and another read or two will lean me towards one or the other.  I am content now in saying it was a great read,  I really did enjoy it.  Like many, I read through quickly.  The imagery was clear, striking and gripping.  While there was little complex plot to speak of - it didn't need one.  In a world such as that, life becomes simple and difficult, that's how the story was presented.  I question some of the decisions by the father, but he's not meant to be infallible, just human.  His identity and former life are meaningless in such a world, and he is left anonymous, which I truly appreciate.  I can also appreciate the risk the boy took at the end - how difficult would it be to carry on alone?  I can't yet give the book five stars, and wavered between three and four, but it's entirely possible that as the years go by and I pick this one up again, I may appreciate it more.  Given the time it takes to read, it's worthwhile for just about anyone."

I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired.

0,"Kate Pearces Retribution is a read that may have triggers for some, so read with caution.  Now that being said this book is a really good read.  Sacrifice, Book 1, needs to be read before this one so that all of the background information on the tribute program and the world they live on is explained.  Kai Mexr was Commander Rehzs right hand man and was supposed to retire when his last mission ended, but he was forced to come back as a trainer for another mission.  His new trainee is Aled Price another person with human genetics and stubborn streak a mile wide.  Kai and Aled butt heads from the very beginning, but realize that they need each other to survive.  They have to deal with the harsh realities of training, and when that is over, the treatment at the hands of the Ungrich.  Palk set his sights on Kai and his trainee and makes sure his presence is felt to both men.  Aled realizes that Kai doesnt believe he deserves better than being taken roughly and without any choices in how he is taken, but trying to make Kai see that he deserves more may be battle too big for Aled.  We see Anna and Rehz in this book as well since the Ungrich seem to have set their sights on human DNA.  Both pairs realize that if their secret is not protected then they will be targets for the military to use them.  When Aled goes in to get his medical clearance and to finally be free to pursue a life with Kai, he is taken for the Ungrich, as is Anna.  Both Kai and Rehz now need to join forces and go rescue their mates.  This book ends on a cliffhanger.  I give this book 4 stars!"
0,"The concierge was so helpful. Without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful. They even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating's. Loved the health club at the back of the hotel. By joining the presidents club, it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities. The rooms were large, updated and had views looking out in 3 directions. The coffee maker in the room was exceptional. Location is great for getting mostly anywhere. Parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground Millennium Garage that was only $25.00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel."

0,"Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born.  We were a little worried about putting toys in his crib, but soon got over that when we realized how well he reacted to Pooh and the music!  Yes, it is a little loud for a lullaby toy, but the volume has never seemed to bother him -- he sleeps right through it.  When he was still in the infant stage, we used the remote control constantly to restart Pooh from the comfort of our bed if our son hadn't fallen asleep yet.  It's great that the remote allows you to select your starting point: the toy comes with three ""stages"" of songs, moving from singing to just music to soft music and bird chirps.  We would replay the softest music when the baby was nearly asleep, the singing when he was still fussy and needed more distraction.  He is one year old now, and he has learned over time to turn it on and off (push the cloud on the pillow).  We know he's awake when Pooh starts singing!  Quite often he hasn't quite had enough sleep, and he turns Pooh on, curls up with his blanket, and goes back to sleep.  The little light under the cloud is a great bonus, since it gives the baby a little ""comfort light"" when Pooh starts to sing (the light fades out as the music softens).  Our son LOVES this toy -- we couldn't imagine bedtime without it!  ONLY drawback (and it's negligible)--he loves it SO much that we really go through the AA batteries!  All things considered, that's a pretty good ""problem"" to have.  We highly recommend this toy."

The only thing I can say is that it does a great job of removing the residue and removing the odor.I was skeptical about the price for this product but I found it a bit too expensive. I did get a free shipping and it was a great deal. I have a 4 month old lab and he's 8 lbs and I have a 60lb lab. He's a bit of a chewer so I was worried about him not getting enough of this.

1,I purchased this light because it has the same light bulb but it comes with a different battery and the other two bulbs are dimmable. The light bulb is a little brighter and it's brighter. It's not a huge deal for me but if I had to choose between these two bulbs I'd probably go with the dimmer option. I'd say this light bulb is a very bright light bulb and it's pretty strong. I like that it's not too yellowish to look at but I'd be happy with it if it had a bright white light. It's not really a bright light bulb but it's probably worth it.
